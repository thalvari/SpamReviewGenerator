0,it does not move as fast as it should and therefore feels very wasted and like botched potential,3
1,not the best movie i ever see but it's a mostly well-done entry in the franchise,3
2,in an honest opinion not the best iron man of the trilogy so far,3
3,i still think it's an illegal weapon,3
4,i was also not to happy with liv tyler's betty ross however occurs almost abruptly,3
5,i will go ahead and say it i liked this movie but it was way to predictable,3
6,overall it's a good movie but it could have been when it comes to pepper,3
7,i felt that the plot was thinner and the movie was a little disjointed but overall fun to watch,3
8,i believe that age of ultron was without a doubt my most anticipated movie of 2015 live up to the hype,3
9,you can see that he's a bit of a let down,3
10,some great characters and some really cool scenes but it was a bit too all over the place,3
11,a heist movie with a man the size of an insect while retaining the strength of a normal size human being,3
12,the first movie was my favorite in the first gotg,3
13,great cast great action and a good cast,3
14,another success in favreau's sequel iron man 2 but less than the avengers and iron man,3
15,it may provide more action but doesn't take itself too seriously,3
16,this seems to be a frequent problem with most marvel films and michael keaton was my biggest surprise as vulture,3
17,i am happy to say that this movie is a breath of fresh air while also tripping over cliches of the big budget blockbusters,3
18,by ditching an empty plot in favor of a more personal story so i can get more invested in it,3
19,i never felt that it was the best of the solo iron man movie so this excludes avengers for now,3
20,i know this isn't a bad thing,3
21,can't wait to see the sequel it was just so pastel,3
22,approached by hope van dyne evangeline lily a,3
23,cool cgi but the plot and the villain are dull and disappointing,3
24,spider-man may not be a necessary addition in civil war but if you love marvel movies then of course you did,3
25,and it would have been interesting to see edgar wright's version wasn't the final cut for this movie,3
26,don't get me wrong there's plenty wrong with iron man 2 is still a very entertaining ride,3
27,this movie is quite entertaining but it doesn't hold well as a stand alone film,3
28,all the cast members did an amazing job as well as michael b jordan,3
29,a reboot that could have been much better and i really wish norton could have stayed for avengers,3
30,this very well could have been the beginning of the film which was seeing all these heroes together and kicking ass,3
31,however liv tyler made up for it and the film had the marvel kryptonite lol which is the crappy villians,3
32,its attempts to get you to care about the characters or get invested in the story or the characters at all,3
33,i personally wanted this movie to focus more on other aspects it was overall a good film,3
34,a fun romp but don't expect a great superhero movie,3
35,i am happy to say that this movie is not the best comic book movies i would put it in my top 10,3
36,5 4 2017 2 a great movie and a must see,3
37,if the point of the iron man suit instead of being in the suit,3
38,first this movie has not nearly as much heart as the previous film though not as good as the first avengers film,3
39,i did like this more then age of ultron but it was not something i had to see,3
40,it's not to say that the film is just that,3
41,i've also heard that as iron man was great iron man 2 was much less amusing that the first,3
42,chadwick boseman steals the show with his mandarin,3
43,i liked this motion picture because of the action and the plot was focused and compelling,3
44,good fun but overall film awesome tape not as good as the first but still a really fun movie,3
45,first was definitely better but this one was a little bit of a nasty side,3
46,not as brilliant as the first but still worth seeing,3
47,the humor and comedy of this movie was very dissapointing for me,3
48,walking into this movie i thought it was a great cool down from age of ultron,3
49,rocket raccoon was something ive never seen a raccoon as an action figure,3
50,that awesome final battle at the end is great but the villains here are too pathetic to be a real threat,3
51,then it was way to many characters used in the movie but overall a good action-driven spectacle that fans will enjoy,3
52,like its lead performance the incredible hulk is much better than ed norton as bruce banner,3
53,and still the dark knight powers on as the best superhero movie i've ever seen in theaters that i've fallen asleep during,3
54,a good movie but not a good one,3
55,i really enjoyed tim roth in this film and even though i don't think anyone does,3
56,it's an okay marvel movie but i can't help but not feel intense when it tries to be,3
57,soooo not as good as the first movie but it still is a good time for sure but not good either,3
58,it's great but as great as the first one,3
59,like said before most of the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
60,overall i am glad that i went to see it two hour later i came out of the theater after the film was over,3
61,the avengers is one of the better disney marvel efforts,3
62,if i may say i prefer they make two parts of this movie is the ending it's so rushed and clichã © d,3
63,honestly it's not nearly as good as the first avengers,3
64,after the tone and events of infinity war seemed like it wouldn't work,3
65,the movie continues shortly after the events of the first avengers while still being a pretty decent film,3
66,the effects are quite honestly some of the best elements while still remaining a pretty unique take,3
67,with all of the characters have some sort of side story which makes the movie feel an hour less than it actually is,3
68,you thought there was no way the next avengers could live up to the original avengers but still has flaws that are easily noticed,3
69,and really it's kinda hard to see that in my opinion as i buy him as this colonel a lot more than i should,3
70,nothing wrong with that but it always tends to come across as scary and only vaguely intimidates,3
71,this movie is visually stunning and his a huge improvement from the first film as a charmingly egotistical but ultimately courageous superhero,3
72,2 i still liked it a lot but it was not something i had to see,3
73,that's fine especially considering what stark went through during the events of the berlin brawl in captain america civil war,3
74,overall iron man 3 is so different from the first i still feel that iron man could have used a little more screen-time,3
75,however the plot is a bit rushed avengers age of ultron is alot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
76,we see the intro of nick fury and black widow are just too awesome to ignore,3
77,the storytelling could have a lot of fun with some great performances and visuals,3
78,not as crisp as the first outing but still an entertaining action movie to help start off the mcu,3
79,i love chris pratt and really enjoyed the first guardians movie but able to keep me engaged with a few plot twists,3
80,by far better then the more recent hulk film but it is still fun and action packed,3
81,ed norton is the perfect choice for ant-man and the wasp the sequel to the excellent iron man,3
82,didn't think paul rudd would fit in a marvel movie i've seen all of them,3
83,same goes with the rest of the cast is good and some of the action scenes like the casino fight were good,3
84,certainly not the best of the series,3
85,the movie shines with the likes of superman ii spider-man 2 are all better films than this,3
86,some useless subplots which don't really have a style of its own,3
87,nothing special i'd say it isn't the best and the action scenes are the best parts b-,3
88,don cheadle does his part in iron man 3 and i think the hulk actually had dimension in the other one,3
89,it feels as if the filmmakers are trying too hard to go for the same laughs of the first film but still fun,3
90,at least there is amazing writing on josh brolin's thanos or michael b jordan's killmonger,3
91,pfeiffer and douglas also steal the show but their characters don't have enough tall buildings to find to be useful,3
92,the powers that be thought it would be a little better,3
93,i actually didn't see the first ant-man to figure out what the infinity stones are,3
94,michael b jordan's character put a bit of a darker tone as well,3
95,it's larger and faster than iron man but it still had many imperfections,3
96,so its not as bad as i remember,3
97,we here at filmgrades can't wait to see ant-man in future marvel films,3
98,an ok sequel but the action scenes make up for the lack of innovation with the script,3
99,while acknowledging the events of the avengers and iron man,3
100,this entry was directed and i think written by shane black who had some good ideas but also some terrible ones,3
101,maybe i walked in with too low of expectations maybe i just can't tell what that missing something is,3
102,not as original as the first but still one of the better ones,3
103,i'm tired of iron man hulk and captain story lines all come together,3
104,sympathetic villain like erik killmonger is great but the rest of the movie,3
105,this was one of the many boring put together ones and a lot of the jokes missing the mark entirely vol,3
106,ii succeeds on the same levels for the most part so i have to recommend it,3
107,a joyful comedy romp that is nowhere near as good as the first,3
108,still ant-man is one of the most visually-stunning movies in the mcu,3
109,black panther stumbles a little bit out of the marvel universe films you'll enjoy this movie a lot,3
110,it looks even better than in the first avengers but is a little too detracted from the generic contract of the series,3
111,there were good parts of the film is a visual spectacle full of colours,3
112,definitely still a fun time at the movies i'll give it a quick eye roll and accept it,3
113,overall guardians ii is a solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe threatens to repeat itself,3
114,avengers age of ultron is overwhelming at times but it is still action-packed and greatly visualized the incredible hulk makes up for that,3
115,i did like this movie but just not as much as the first one i recommend it,3
116,a very different take on the hulk character than other media and really does a good job at slowly expanding the mcu,3
117,reilly glenn close peter serafinowicz and benicio del toro as well as a comedy about being a dad,3
118,the weakest of the mcu films the incredible hulk still serves as an entertaining film,3
119,and really a big part of the reason why she doesn't work is curiously the new randomly phasing villain,3
120,previously i gave iron man 3 a welcome addition to the mcu albeit not a total home-run,3
121,but overall it's still a fun ride,3
122,at the end of the day this is a comic book movie and just a good movie in general,3
123,then he of course proves that he was the man for the role,3
124,as tony stark is which i don't like baby groot but the test was awesome,3
125,the movie is perfectly adequate in almost every way but i can't say it is not is average,3
126,while not the worst movie in the iron man suit and more of him masterminding his technological ability,3
127,again though this may not necessarily be the movie's fault itself as much as it maintains most of the magic in iron man,3
128,it does at least skip the origin story so that we don't even get to see spider-man swinging around new york,3
129,the marvel movies are way better than most of the other marvel characters but something was just missing here,3
130,although it made a decent action movie it would have been much better than it was,3
131,iron man 2 is still overshadowed by the original due to it's muddled production is unheard of,3
132,tuesday afternoon is a good time for sure but not good either,3
133,spoilers in this reviewiron man 3 is a fun entertaining watch,3
134,and perfectly supplemented the main focus which is of course tony stark iron man and paltrow is equally game as pepper potts,3
135,however the story was very strong and the movie deserves 74 %,3
136,before the release of the movie avengers age of ultron is a brilliant movie with some flaws,3
137,believe it or not that may be a good movie but not as good as the first movie but there is plenty of conflict,3
138,suffering from many of iron man 2 is a successful sequel in the iron man franchise,3
139,it's not as good as the movie could have been better was predictable,3
140,i think i liked one scene he was in he had my undivided attention,3
141,rocket raccoon was something ive never seen a raccoon as an action figure,3
142,there is an extremely brief flare of action at the beginning of the film includes plot points that come off as a bit forced,3
143,i liked the idea behind the plot of the original but it's decent,3
144,yondu michael rooker is the standout and he delivers one of my favorite marvel movies but still worth the price of admission,3
145,not marvel's greatest but the movie does a great job again as tony stark,3
146,i understand they put literally every black actor in hollywood in this movie but minus that its a good movie,3
147,right let's get the obvious out of the way this film is not as good as the original,3
148,a sequel that improves but it may not be marvels most sturdy film or evenly brought together story,3
149,this film sees less of tony stark in a way no one else can,3
150,after all the movies they have created so far it's not as effective as the first iron man movie did,3
151,which is fine but otherwise they took a huge step backwards with the character of banner like traveling to the arctic for a suicide attempt,3
152,it wasn't as good as the first and third movies in the series but not the worst,3
153,but i just didn't connect with the movie,3
154,a mediocre marvel hero movie that isn't as good as its predecessor but still disappointing,3
155,the cast is great also the action is way too busy,3
156,its to bad edward norton wasn't bruce banner in the avengers but again its an improvement on what came before,3
157,still black panther is not a bad movie but its flaws tend to show more often,3
158,not as strong as the original but it's decent,3
159,it wasn't bad but it felt forced like they were trying to do too many story lines,3
160,absurdly goofy at points but it's still not their best work,3
161,it shows him as a 15 year old kid who doesn't really care much for the mandarin twist so yeah,3
162,action sequence was way better than the ang lee attempt,3
163,the first sequel to the iron man trilogy is not quite as good as in the first film,3
164,the new characters here include ghost portrayed by hannah john-kamen and laurence fishburne were also great in it,3
165,it's enjoyable with a great performance by paul rudd and michael douglas,3
166,the movie itself didn't amuse me as much as other films did but it wasn't that bad either,3
167,74%riddled with cliches but enthusiastically acted by its charismatic stars ant-man is not integral to this story at all,3
168,i see every reason to award this hero ensemble a rating of 4 out of 5 for these fine supporting peeps,3
169,it's dumb sure but it's by no means a bad film but not as good as i'd hoped,3
170,the biggest flaw of the movie is of course the villain,3
171,not as good as the original but it isn't until he's brought to life in the movie that are boring,3
172,perhaps the completion to 10 years of mcu could have been better but who knows what would have happened,3
173,the action is well done and a good marvel movie but i can't stand robert downey jr,3
174,the action sequences were very enjoyable and i still think even though it was touching it didn't really fit the character,3
175,it's the worst marvel movie at least,3
176,the cgi is very realistic and jon favreau's directing is top-notch and overall it's just a ok movie,3
177,here it's a more complex affair but that doesn't stop it being a fun couple of hours,3
178,the follow up to the first one,3
179,much like the first movie there aren't many things he isn't good in,3
180,captain america looked so stinking ridiculous that he could have been a much better movie than it actually is,3
181,some great moments but got a little too big for their own boots,3
182,this is a solidly entertaining film but if i'm being honest i liked venom more than spider-man,3
183,the film's more humorous tone works but it's hard to find much to meaningfully hone in on and relate to,3
184,after the tone and events of infinity war seemed like it wouldn't work,3
185,however one of the things i most enjoyed about this movie was ultron and he was not used well,3
186,mickey rourke doesn't do a good job,3
187,i do think it is an improvement over the 2003 ang lee adaptation,3
188,there is so much advertising it pads the movie out for about 20 minutes and trashes most of northern manhattan,3
189,this was the real antagonist of iron man 2 or thor the dark world as mediocre marvel films,3
190,as is usually the case with the mcu however age of ultron is action packed humorous and somewhat fun,3
191,the things that happen in the first half of the film,3
192,i've seen a lot worse when it comes to looking at avengers age of ultron is good,3
193,i actually liked it more than the first,3
194,i always enjoy a new story in a marvel movie but was just fine,3
195,gwneyth paltrow and jon favreau are all excellent,3
196,just because it's not as slick as it's predecessor but rdj added more depth too tony stark iron man,3
197,paul rudd's scott lang faces the consequences of his involvement in the expanding avengers universe fares far better than this,3
198,hannah john-kamen and goggins also give solid performances but at the same time and the result is a forgettable sequel,3
199,a funny and thrilling movie with great special effects and cool graphics used throughout including on ghost the antagonist,3
200,every single actor on screen is having a ton of fun though i still love ang lee's version,3
201,the ending crashes and not in a fun comic book way,3
202,not bad not great not spider-man but was not fond of the story,3
203,the presence of tony stark throughout the movie i was also not to happy with liv tyler's betty ross however occurs almost abruptly,3
204,elizabeth olsen wanda maximoff scarlet witch is also a better rhodes than terrence howard,3
205,entertaining and slightly better than the hulk film,3
206,great action still and tony stark is once again the star of the film is an exchange between goggins and pena,3
207,the end credit was really funny and i was happy with edward norton's performance and with tim roth's also,3
208,unfortunately it was not as bad as i remember,3
209,the writing in this film is not as good as the first but it still gives some good action scenes and no real major problems,3
210,this is one of the mcu's usually bland antagonists,3
211,on the flip side of that argument while some scenes such as the church scene were horrifically edited and were done extremely poorly,3
212,in fact i can say that it's a curse not just a superpower that's afflicting bruce,3
213,closing i like to say that it's not even better than the first one,3
214,the incredible hulk decided to have much more action than the 1st but pretty much even with the 2nd movie,3
215,after the brilliant iron man film and for a good reason,3
216,this movie wasn't as good as you'd expect from marvel humerous and highly entertaining,3
217,while this chapter isn't nearly as compelling as the rest of the heavily interconnected mcu movies,3
218,iron man 2 is a successful sequel in the iron man suit and more of him masterminding his technological ability,3
219,this movie isn't as good as the first movie but it's not enough to keep you going,3
220,the dude was kind of a let down but it is not good enough,3
221,the follow-up still keeps a lot of the qualities we see in hero characters,3
222,i found the movie entertaining but by no means a great villain please don't think i want to step away from it,3
223,the problem with iron man 3 it's definitely better than the previous but still could have been better,3
224,ant-man manages to be a bit too jokey for my liking but still good none the less,3
225,it just suffers a bit of a strange choice dr,3
226,thanos cant save this from being a terrific spider-man story,3
227,i still enjoyed iron man 2 it was a lot of fun with some great performances and visuals,3
228,sequelitus is doing the work here but it's still not a bad movie it's just another variation on the same old shit,3
229,maybe i'm just too much of a follow-up,3
230,the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic but the storytelling is a bit oddly structured,3
231,but they take up so much time of the film and it would have been nice to see sampson,3
232,the villain is good but the story is a little unfocused,3
233,the villain was alright but there wasn't enough time to get attached,3
234,it doesn't break any barriers and it doesn't last long and the second time is probably shorter,3
235,quill has a lot of fun watching the hulk and the fight like i said before is awesome,3
236,rather the film's writing seemed totally self-aware of their situation to give them the weight necessary,3
237,the plot was sketchy throughout most of the movie is of course the villain,3
238,andy serkis also is a bright spot of the movie as the mcu was still fledgling at the time,3
239,cocky condescending with a brilliant mind yet at the same time the action scenes and bits of humor were good,3
240,not the best movie i've seen but still enjoyable,3
241,my chief complaint for this film is a relatively decent sequel,3
242,entertaining and slightly better than the first one hulk 2003,3
243,tom holland stands out in this film and tyler portrays ross wonderfully,3
244,simply put ant-man is a welcome addition to the avengers canon entertaining,3
245,scott lang is trying to do the right thing by himself and his crew,3
246,i still enjoyed it but there's also some of the deaths and lack of blood with one death in particular,3
247,after his battle with the avengers in berlin peter parker returns home to live with his aunt,3
248,iron man 2 lacks the adrenaline and swagger of the first entry but above the overstuffed but still enjoyable second,3
249,it has all the stuff you expect from a big summer blockbuster film,3
250,not as good as the first avengers film one of the better movies this year so far,3
251,was a fun movie and it had a lot of room for improvement but at the end of the film,3
252,i remember having so much fun watching the first movie but it still has its charm from its ever powerful yet damaged tony stark,3
253,iron man 2 has most of the things that made the first special,3
254,and mickey rourke as ivan whiplash i think he's super funny amp i laughed quite a bit during this film,3
255,a dark story about a dark character the incredible hulk manages to have a decent narrative and fine acting,3
256,from great villain casting to amazing battles this movie had a lot to live up to the sam reni sprider-man 2,3
257,a fantastic edition to marvel's cinematic universe is becoming noticeably by-the-numbers movie,3
258,though the actors are all great but the story is predictable and almost all the jokes fall completely flat,3
259,while this chapter isn't nearly as compelling as the rest of the marvel family,3
260,it just feels like more of the same well but the plot and story was cheesy but i liked paul rudd in it,3
261,i believe that age of ultron was a good movie but the weakest of the phase 1 movies in my opinion,3
262,another fun marvel movie with good action sequences but it lacks in certain aspects,3
263,it was okay i enjoyed the first movie but better than the second with better action scenes and good drama,3
264,michael douglas and evangeline lilly did very good work in this movie and not cgi garbage like the ang lee version,3
265,after all that multi-character over-the-top due to some of the emotional scenes,3
266,however it seems that avengers age of ultron was very enjoyable,3
267,however the final act made up for this with humor fact pacing and amazing cgi,3
268,that scene was cringe-worthy and it felt like a super hero film to me,3
269,the green-headed stepchild of the marvel universe in general with great actors,3
270,the storyline was a tad bit boring but i've come to expect do not by any means stand in the way of things,3
271,needless to say this is the best one so far,3
272,the action wasn't at all great to me but was still awesome and a thrill to watch,3
273,but frankly i struggle to critique it because i can't imagine wanting to see it again,3
274,chris pratt is one of the better ones,3
275,not as good as the first one and was extremely excited to see the next volume,3
276,the 3d version of the film was just meh to me,3
277,perhaps it's just too much going on and the result is as muddled as that sounds,3
278,i'm tired of iron man hulk and captain story lines all come together,3
279,a film that can stand on it's own as a film and being it's own side story in this already big universe,3
280,some elements don't make a ton of money and rightfully so because even though it is a bit too long,3
281,not exactly as fresh as the first one but still pretty damn good,3
282,while sadly unmemorable ant-man was a welcome refreshment to the comic book source material,3
283,i can't fault it really the lack of action scenes preety much an enjoyable movie,3
284,to me this film seemed to have even less to do with the fact that he was truly a child of the 80s,3
285,more entertaining than the last hulk film but it was okay,3
286,the pros outweigh the cons for sure but it's the way it plays out that is so enjoyable,3
287,overall a fun heist movie that suffers from a few too many and they dragged on a bit too long though,3
288,now ultron is my favorite marvel comic villain so there was a lot of fun and i really enjoyed the film,3
289,i still enjoyed it but there's also some of the deaths and lack of blood with one death in particular,3
290,let's just hope there isn't a whole lot of anything else,3
291,iron man 2 was good but could have been done so much cleaner and work so much better,3
292,stark is a little too much baby groot,3
293,sadly did not live up to the heights of its predecessor,3
294,mickey rourke is really good but whiplash is a terrible villain he's very unthreatening and has awful motivation,3
295,the castedward norton as bruce banner the hulk norton is a good hulk movie better than the ang lee attempt,3
296,still is a good time for sure but not a lot of logic with fun popcorn movie action,3
297,but the cgi goes over the top and just too much,3
298,thus i loved the movie but its not as good as the first avegers at times but falls short by the end,3
299,paul rudd is an enjoyable ant-man 2 is a solid entry into the mcu,3
300,definitely another fine addition to the mcu it was a fun movie but not a good one,3
301,the action very good overall and the final huge action scene in the third act with endless action and fight sequences,3
302,i may see it again some day but it really is the ending that makes this film,3
303,in the end ant-man is another solid entry to the marvel canon,3
304,but they take up so much time of the film despite him being the primary artist in charge of the film,3
305,we still get iron man and the soundtrack attracts fanatic masses,3
306,finally good but could have been done with this antagonist,3
307,greg this was a fun addition to the marvel tableau of superhero movies,3
308,it was a pretty generic movie don't get me wrong this was a good place to start,3
309,he's just a father who got gypped and is trying to gain more control over his transformation,3
310,a pretty great movie with a nice story,3
311,that's fine especially considering what stark went through during the events of the first film and fails to impress me,3
312,not bad but not spectacular i praise the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
313,and i thought it was a bit of a scrawny kid,3
314,it's the second installment in the iron man trilogy is not quite as good as in the first film and fails to impress me,3
315,after watching it a second time i still feel that iron man could have used a bit more action,3
316,i favor the separate characters and separate imaginary worlds i wish there was more of andy serkis's klaue,3
317,worth seeing and a fun flick almost as good as the first but it doesn't have the same wow factor,3
318,not as good as the first but still a very well done job in evening everything out,3
319,the villains are perhaps the least memorable of the trilogy but don't let that spoil what is fun in this movie,3
320,this time around the focus is back on tony stark and robert downey jr is the attraction throughout and sizzles with his rocking performance,3
321,iron man 3 takes the character of tony stark in the iron man trilogy iron man 3 is an improvement over iron man 2,3
322,it was meant to be a mid-level entry meant to be a mid-level entry meant to be a great movie,3
323,when you watch the final battle in the city is cool but there's nothing clever new or memorable about it,3
324,just not quite as good as the first but still worth seeing,3
325,age of ultron has big enough story and plenty of action to keep people coming back for more,3
326,vulture is a great villain and it's always good to see sam rockwell,3
327,a well-made movie with characters you care about are put to the test in interesting ways,3
328,this is a good not great entry to the mcu that just about manages to hold off its spoof feel,3
329,it's still an enjoyable comic book movie that did not take itself too seriously,3
330,this movie would have loved to see a different type of story than your typical mcu movie,3
331,i saw it in 3d avx and i don't blame for having stale parts,3
332,the big scene at the end suffers a bit from having too little action,3
333,overshadowed by iron man the incredible hulk is a really good comic book movie that did not take itself too seriously,3
334,good but not the best of the series,3
335,the bulk of the plot revolves around her and her parents to the point where the loud humor is almost too stupid and relentless,3
336,hulk is nothing special but it is still a great entry to the mcu that just about manages to hold off its spoof feel,3
337,this movie is quite entertaining but it doesn't distract too much from the rest of the movie,3
338,msu actually brought everyone together to save the universe from thanos plans for mass genocide,3
339,the first villain ghost was a great character moment for both of them,3
340,he clearly has a lot of great action set pieces,3
341,not a bad film it's just that iron man 3 is still an entertaining film,3
342,the hulk here is pretty good but he's not as good as i expected it to be,3
343,and the final scenes are with the rest of the mcu save for wolverine,3
344,i enjoyed it in the end so that's not a good thing if he's trying,3
345,the conclusion is that is a good movie spectacular scenery and great ideas,3
346,but this leads to predictability with the other characters but it didn't help the situation either,3
347,michelle pfeiffer is a damn-fine addition to the mcu it was a fun movie but nothing special by any means,3
348,the first hour or so until we met klaw is some of the best action the mcu has to offer,3
349,i had one hell of a fun ride,3
350,the avengers are much more organised combine better and the action is good and the cinematography is good,3
351,solid marvel film one of the best movies of 2012,3
352,to be sure this is a movie about evolving relationships,3
353,he's kind of the heart of the film and it would have made iron man more popular and more in its time,3
354,spider-man homecoming is sure to engage audiences as much as it maintains most of the magic in iron man,3
355,i liked the changes for the most part a great villain the addition of scarlet witch and vision,3
356,gog always felt a little wierd as compared to the first one but not quite as good as the first film,3
357,on the flip side of that argument while some scenes such as the church scene were horrifically edited and were done extremely poorly,3
358,not as good as iron man was but the incredible hulk is an underwhelming anticlimactic adaptation of marvel's hulk,3
359,it provides good set-up for future movies like winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy vol,3
360,action wasn't as good as it is in real life,3
361,even in the final predictable cgi punchfest between spider-man and parents may not let their kids watch this,3
362,edward norton is really good in the role as is tim roth in his,3
363,what i got to say about iron man 2 that was lacking for me this is where the problems are gon na start,3
364,the incredible hulk is one of the most anticipated films of the year the sequel to one of their best,3
365,nothing i say could say would sway the public from an iron man movie it's still worth a watch or two,3
366,despite not being quite on the level of avengers 1 or 3,3
367,my grade for the film nothing more than a cash grab for hardcore marvel fans,3
368,as you can see all the good elements that iron man 2 has some great action performances and special effects,3
369,that's what i got with ant-man when he's running around and jumping and flying,3
370,with that said it's still one of the stronger offerings the mcu has given us,3
371,this humorous opening scene is indicative of the rest of the cast make it a film worth seeing,3
372,ultron is a great movie and it's nice to see this character get a bigger and better future for stark industries,3
373,but wasn't as good as the first one and it doesn't help that these conversations aren't particularly interesting,3
374,we've seen black panther in civil war and they do recognize that with this sequel,3
375,was a little confused as to the concept of this film and feel it deserves more credit than it receives,3
376,despite the fact that there must have been a massive budget for special effects and an interesting plot,3
377,at times the movie felt like it was not as bad as we think,3
378,this film is good but i'm pretty burned out on all the superhero movies but this one was still very good,3
379,downey still delivers here but it's still fun to watch,3
380,the best marvel movie but the incredible hulk is an improvement over iron man 2,3
381,the movie is ok a lot of action to this movie and fighting,3
382,mostly just made me want to watch the movie go watch the movie,3
383,do not get me wrong i did like this movie but just not as much as the first or the origin story,3
384,i never felt that it was the russo brothers directing,3
385,it was clearly better than the first iron man and both captain america pictures have really approached greatness,3
386,many dark scenes that were hard to see the action for most of it we just sit around watching the heroes talk,3
387,so let's hope the next one is a little better but overall movie is not funny but somewhat letdown sequel,3
388,as a film it is better than the obvious and this isn't,3
389,edward norton is banner hulk in this film and had some of the best action the mcu has to offer,3
390,i personally prefer the first one but in the same style,3
391,also i thought this film focused more on the heroes than the first ant-man so i was curious about his film well,3
392,not quite up to the standards of the first installment but still very entertaining with some very cool action moments,3
393,a better film than its predecessor but not quite as good as its predecessor but is a competent sequel,3
394,age of ultron was without a doubt my most anticipated movie of 2015 live up to the hype,3
395,what i got to say about iron man 2 as the weakest and well i agree,3
396,overall though a very strong entry into the marvel cinematic universe while not holding up as well as its predecessor,3
397,enjoyable enough heist movie set in the marvel universe but i feel like they were trying to do too many things at once,3
398,action sequence was way better than the previous but still could have been better,3
399,it just didn't appeal to me for some reason,3
400,i said ant man and the wasp is exactly what you might expect it to be better still,3
401,besides that this is one of the most powerful weapon in the universe,3
402,some great characters and some really cool scenes but it was a fun time at the movies,3
403,i don't like edward norton as bruce banner the hulk norton is a good hulk movie,3
404,the humor and comedy of this movie was michael keaton as toomes,3
405,this seems to be a bit innovative,3
406,i thought the first ant-man and the wasp the sequel to the movie that kick started the mcu was very political,3
407,i liked it but some of the characters felt like they were just desperate for laughs,3
408,it's a more complex affair but that doesn't go anywhere until winter soldier,3
409,kind of luckluster on repeat viewings which is a shame as the original ideas behind this character are really intriguing,3
410,i do wish he was used better but i'm not 10 and i hated those batman movies,3
411,the problem with this movie is the villain who was the worst of the avengers runners up it still beats out hulk,3
412,i liked it but not as good as the original but fans will enjoy it,3
413,not bad but not great the incredible hulk is still an intense and action-packed the cgi is brilliant,3
414,lucky for marvel disney there is a justifiable reason for all of the advertising for the avengers that is featured prominently throughout,3
415,more hulk smash action than the ang lee's hulk but not the best they've done,3
416,what this means exactly is that the movie is trying to comment about,3
417,good action and good story but not enough destruction,3
418,however it seems that avengers age of ultron is more of the avengers with some added wrinkles,3
419,don cheadle does his part in iron man 3 but the majority of the set pieces 1000 % better than the hulk film,3
420,they did pretty good juggling so many characters and has a worthy but cliched villain,3
421,after the highs of the first one because frankly the novelty wears off but still a good movie to watch,3
422,bit of a nothing film building up to iron man or iron man 2 but was still a good film,3
423,despite being noticeably less enjoyable than the three other marvel movies this is unique cast is plus and story is good,3
424,i will go ahead and say it i liked this movie but it was still a decent film,3
425,the movie is mu and entertained and it works very well it's a good movie but for me it didn't feel natural,3
426,all the cast members did an amazing job portraying there roles,3
427,and where in the world is going on,3
428,the flow and plot though common was solid with the help of chitauris loki will arrive to controle the planet earth,3
429,it would obviously be difficult to equal the first avengers film skirted the line between pure action and story fairly well,3
430,too many things going on make iron man 2 the third still lacks the eye widening thrills of the first one,3
431,not as good as the first movie but it was still a fun super-hero movie which surprised me,3
432,not as crisp as the first outing but still an entertaining action movie to help start off the mcu,3
433,the movie is good but not great,3
434,the next film in the marvel cinematic universe then,3
435,for a movie that came out in the same year,3
436,would definitely recommend but does not live up to the standards it doesn't mean it wasn't good,3
437,while awesome to see spidey back in the mcu where at least the whole world is not at stake,3
438,from a production and acting standpoint the film is a visual spectacle full of colours,3
439,they tried to hard with some of the star wars movies,3
440,think honey i shrunk the ant-man suit and fight alongside the wasp,3
441,this villain was greatly hyped up to be one of the best casting choices that marvel has had since having robert downey jr,3
442,a big step forward from iron man 2 which failed in many different ways,3
443,i enjoyed it but not the best of the series,3
444,3 10 watch it if you're bored or need to kill time,3
445,i do have some nostalgia for this movie because it is very fun and arrives when it's needed,3
446,the action sequences in the first half of the movie which i do think are it's strongest,3
447,i will say it's better than iron man 2 but was still a good marvel fan but wasn't as good as i expected,3
448,it's uneven for sure but this is still one of the better ways to get stabbed,3
449,with that being said i would be lying if i said i wasn't somewhat disappointed,3
450,the shrink tech and visual gags are easily the biggest improvement from the first film as much as it is mine,3
451,well i think the biggest problem of this movie is the ending it's so rushed and clichã © d,3
452,certainly not the best of the series then,3
453,sure in my opinion he can be a reliable leading man,3
454,however like many others i had huge expectations especially after the unexpected success of the first iron man film,3
455,pom klementieff is a strong addition to the marvel film series,3
456,it's as good as the first and people say it doesn't have a gritty edge especially the early scenes in the middle east,3
457,plenty of good ideas and a story that is very sub-par to the first movie,3
458,i love the hulk as a character but missing his former state too,3
459,boring at times but still a very well done and well acted movie,3
460,i don't think this is as bad as everyone has been saying,3
461,this on the other hand there is not a lot of action and some really cool action,3
462,overall very enjoyable and laughable much like the first movie there aren't many things he isn't good in,3
463,the villain was alright but there wasn't enough time to get attached,3
464,rather the film's writing seemed totally self-aware of their situation to give them the weight necessary,3
465,iron man 2 is not as good as the first but still an enjoyable romp,3
466,a great slap slick joy ride that was a little too reminiscent of raiders of the lost ark for me,3
467,overall it is probably marvel's worst movie to date but that's not a good thing if he's trying,3
468,first it was arnold in tg and in ant-man's perspective from macro photography through the subatomic,3
469,it was a great movie but it was still a riot and an action-packed adventure,3
470,it was a pretty good movie if not for mainly rdj and the supporting cast adds the needed elements around him,3
471,i enjoyed age of ultron a little less than the first avengers but just because it doesn't really do much more than that,3
472,well the movie certainly has some good action as well as the genuine fun which characterizes the mcu,3
473,i personally prefer the first one but not quite as good as the first movie,3
474,while it may not be the best spider-man is now part of the marvel cinematic universe,3
475,i must say however that ant-man is another solid entry to the mcu that just about manages to hold off its spoof feel,3
476,an average action flick it isn't too special but still an enjoyable film thanks to downey and paltrow's chemistry,3
477,yea it was a good movie but it just feels like a lot of sequels it's a fine successor but nowhere near the first,3
478,this film is also quite boring there are just long stretches in the movie that doesn't make it a great movie,3
479,ant-man has very little influence on the rest of the mcu and delivers a mostly satisfying film,3
480,i like ironman but i was not invested in the characters or the ridiculousness of the finale,3
481,thinking back on guardians of the galaxy took were sheer fun,3
482,while corey stoll gave a great performance though it's nothing we haven't seen them before,3
483,super funny i love the minutes sure scenes and it just didn't immediately connect with me like the other films did,3
484,and this movie feels like it is just noise and explosions,3
485,unlike other marvel movies this year guardians of the galaxy and not as spectacular as it either,3
486,it's pretty weak for marvel but it's definitely not as good as the avengers first film,3
487,cut her out of the film and it just feels like more of the same,3
488,missing the humor of the other marvel films but as a result it doesn't really have too much to do,3
489,i liked this film more than the first one in plot direction and performances,3
490,i think the biggest problem is the way the villain in the movie and was a very welcome and entertaining surprise,3
491,indeed this film prioritizes the manners experienced by tony stark from joining the elite army of superheroes,3
492,to be sure this is a movie about evolving relationships,3
493,this is the status quo for much of the first half of the movie which i do think are it's strongest,3
494,this film was not as good as the first avengers movie,3
495,where this version differs first and foremost is in focusing more on the action and the comedy but this one is meh,3
496,3 10 watch it if you're bored or need to kill time,3
497,the action wasn't at all great to me but was still awesome and a thrill to watch,3
498,not one of the best things about the movie is the closest we will get to a disney marvel b-movie,3
499,speaking of the humor while at times it was witty and spot-on and for the most part fits well into the film,3
500,we were then presented with yet another spider-man 3 resonates with me more than this film,3
501,the biggest flaw of age of ultron is a great movie or awful,3
502,at the end of the day i think the hulk actually had dimension in the other one,3
503,even though there is a lot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
504,but in the end this film is just above average with an ok cast,3
505,out of the marvel universe in the future,3
506,the incredible hulk did a good job but the plot needs direction and a better villain would've made me rate this film higher,3
507,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but this movie was still good,3
508,movie didnt have that same magic as the first one and was extremely excited to see the next volume,3
509,josh whedon has already announced that he won't be in any more marvel films,3
510,sure the plot isn't the strongest of the mcu bunch,3
511,on the other hand when we want a sequel to be better than the genesis story that precedes it,3
512,no way it's not one of the best marvel movies out there,3
513,i gave it 4 stars the night i saw the film i honestly was worried about how it would deliver,3
514,the hulk has been done better justice in the past and the result is as muddled as that sounds,3
515,after the disappointing avengers age of ultron ant-man was a solid superhero but i would have loved just a wee bit less cliche,3
516,the hulk has been done better justice in the past and the action scenes are really only what i like about the movie,3
517,i'd say it's more dramatic than other super hero movies but this one wasn't so bad to me this one,3
518,so i'm a bit on the wrong side of the law and not violate his parole,3
519,while i don't enjoy superhero movies i had to watch the trailer again to recall seeing it,3
520,if not for those 2 things spicing it up the film would have been 5 stars if michael pena was the lead,3
521,a mediocre follow-up to the events of avengers but i think there was something missing,3
522,the action and special effects were good and the story was well played out and action packed of course,3
523,he is not as cool as the x-men's asgard wakanda dr,3
524,a snappy pacy first half is let down by a cartoonish and absurd final battle sequence,3
525,but this is the weakest of iron man's suits flying around and fighting is really stupid,3
526,solid marvel film one of the best movies of 2012,3
527,technically he doesn't have any edge-of-the-way from marvel films and marvel comics and studios,3
528,strong humor and the best action in the film was also great,3
529,although i always enjoy robert downey jr amp scarlett johansson i just couldn't get enough of this so keep em coming,3
530,in iron man 2 but was still a good marvel fan but wasn't as bad as hulk,3
531,the final battle felt a bit like the last one but still not as bad as i was told,3
532,my biggest problem with this movie is the movie that truly brings out the marvel cinematic universe but definitely not the weakest as well,3
533,this angry mcu reboot boasts great action amp cgi within the course of the film as a friendly neighborhood spider-man,3
534,a decent addition to the mcu this film does not surpass many other marvel movies but it is not bad or meh,3
535,however flaws aside this is a fun movie to watch but altogether rather unmemorable,3
536,it seemed a bit cartoonish most of the time in the film is handled,3
537,the only difference is the kind of movie my dad would've enjoyed,3
538,i know this isn't a bad thing,3
539,upon re-watches the film doesn't hold up as much as i gave it credit to before,3
540,that awesome final battle at the end is great but the rest of the movie in the long run,3
541,the bulk of the plot revolves around her and her parents to the point where the loud humor is almost too stupid and relentless,3
542,the movie shines with the likes of superman ii spider-man 2 captain america the winter soldier,3
543,first this movie has not nearly as much heart as the previous film and doesn't forget to have fun,3
544,it can't beat iron man but the incredible hulk is one of the few actors like forest whitaker who could actually act,3
545,this humorous opening scene is indicative of the rest of the film especially one intended for youthful audiences,3
546,marvel's charm carry the whole movie and the fighting scenes were not as good as first 2,3
547,i don't read comics at all so i knew nothing about ant-man is out too huh,3
548,let's be clear here even though i consider the ant-man suit and fight alongside the wasp,3
549,after the tone and events of infinity war seemed like it wouldn't work,3
550,lighthearted and fairly fun time at the cinema but it really is the ending that makes this film,3
551,norton also does a decent job but this film really feels like it could have been done so much cleaner and work so much better,3
552,and sam rockwell as justin hammer is the main villain but when her back story is relieved not so much,3
553,back in the 80s hank pym michael douglas and janet van dyne michelle pfeiffer lost for decades in the subatomic quantum realm,3
554,as the status of a marvel fan i'd definitely recommend infinity war,3
555,the pepper and tony relationship is better than ever in iron man 2 which barely achieved place mat status,3
556,anti-man plays a pivotal role in shaping the marvel cinematic universe with some of the best i've ever seen,3
557,great cast great action and a great performance from robert downey jr,3
558,sure there are quite a few unnecessary elements of the film's humor stemming from baby groot vin diesel,3
559,sad to say this does not match up to the 1st and 3rd but it is still fun and action packed,3
560,it is deadly serious when it's not all over the place you can't follow whose getting hit,3
561,preferred it the first time i saw it i had a great time,3
562,however this is often overshadowed with the introduction of a new rhodey was smooth,3
563,the most noteworthy is that the film is as good as it is in the marvel cinematic universe films owned by disney,3
564,i just didn't connect with the movie,3
565,that's fine especially considering what stark went through during the events of avengers assemble and a nice endnote to a strong superhero trilogy,3
566,and tony stark are one and the same with one of the smaller chapters no pun intended,3
567,when it is funny and irreverent guardians of the galaxy is a welcomed genre entry in an over saturated market,3
568,however like many others i had huge expectations especially after the unexpected success of the first iron man,3
569,and i agree with cinemasins that a lot of it can just feel like waiting around,3
570,once again knocks it out of the park with m'baku,3
571,i had a great time watching this movie but i enjoyed it just as much as the first one i don't know,3
572,iron man 2 does not exceed its predecessor it is still an enjoyable action-comedy flick with great acting,3
573,jon favreau once again delivers on the action and the comedy but this one is not among them,3
574,hank was betrayed by a young man he was mentoring darren cross corey stoll is attempting to replicate pyms shrinking technology,3
575,and really if i'm being honest loved the first one this one is bit meh,3
576,i need to clarify the main reason why this film worked,3
577,obviously there's still the over-the-top due to some of the humor just doesn't work,3
578,the hulk here is pretty good but it's far from my favorite marvel film which is iron man the first one,3
579,my compliments to the people in front of the previous installment and is a fun movie that entertains this movie does it,3
580,iron man 2 is a decent sequel but not as great as i expected but still a good one,3
581,i had the watched all the movies that came before it starring eric bana hulk 2003,3
582,the producers unabashedly introduce that a sequel will be coming at the end of the first movie fun to watch but just missed the mark,3
583,this isn't a bad movie it's just another iron man movie,3
584,when you give ben kingsley the opportunity of creating one of the best and funniest parts of the film robert downey jr,3
585,overall though this film was a little long and parts of it could have been directed by anybody,3
586,letitia wright did a great job with it,3
587,not only in other comicbook flicks but in other spider-man movies like this i can't be excited,3
588,ant-man and the wasp is a fun sequel that has villain and stakes problems,3
589,a really good hulk movie edward norton is perfect in the role but hulk movies have never been that great,3
590,if i may say i prefer they make two parts of this movie is the ending it's so rushed and clichã © d,3
591,back in the 80s hank pym michael douglas and janet van dyne michelle pfeiffer lost for decades in the subatomic quantum realm,3
592,otherwise the action is good and the action scenes are the best parts of this iron man movie,3
593,how could i forget to rate this movie when i was in oakland california,3
594,the villain obadiah is pure evil i just don't understand why black was hired to direct this,3
595,not the strongest marvel movie but worth a watch if you get chance,3
596,it's a marvel film of course there are far worse fates to attain,3
597,great effects work gets us the rest of the mcu it feels seemingly pointless and inconsequential,3
598,robert downey jr puts up one of the best marvel's to come out in theatres it looks unsurprisinly amazing,3
599,the screenplay is a little slow in building for me,3
600,iron man 2 is about as good as the first film which is a shame as the original ideas behind this character are really intriguing,3
601,uneven pacing keeps this from being one of marvel's lesser known superheroes popularity,3
602,it's not a terrible movie but it isn't the worst marvel movie i've seen but still enjoyable,3
603,closing i like to say that i was somewhat wrong,3
604,this just didn't bring anything new to the table and this is just a starting point for both of them,3
605,her acting seemed kinda forced and it didn't feel that important to me,3
606,some useless subplots which don't really have a style of its own,3
607,the story is very similar to the plot of the original but seems a bit less focused,3
608,i don't think this is a great start to their second phase of movies,3
609,i never wanted to see the iron man movies but the entire marvel cinematic universe,3
610,not a good iron man film but it could have been directed by anyone,3
611,i'm not a fan of the superhero genre and what we've seen so far,3
612,it's a good movie but not as good as the first movie but this payoff does not work,3
613,i eventually accepted this for what it is because there are too many subplots that don't really work well in movie form,3
614,fun action packed movie that retrospectively doesn't fit in the mcu even though he's not called the vulture in the film,3
615,he really shows why he is one of bp's main villans,3
616,a convoluted plot and week supporting characters make iron man 2 not as great as the original,3
617,most importantly the film gives you a good dose of entertaining sometimes slightly forced humor,3
618,yet all in all it's a bit of a spin on the villain though i feel more could've been done with his character,3
619,paul rudd's scott lang faces the consequences of his involvement in the expanding avengers universe fares far better than this,3
620,most of the action and the plot was a bit messy but age of ultron still delivers what marvel has already done before,3
621,it does have some funny moments that doesn't take itself as seriously as the other ones,3
622,not necessarily the best film cut-together for marvel with a lot of action and effects basically a video game,3
623,a great slap slick joy ride that was a little too much sam rockwell's character is a little ridiculous etc,3
624,and this movie feels like it is just noise and explosions,3
625,i still love the first one and was extremely excited to see the next volume,3
626,however should a person wish to only hit the major points the best of the two volumes the daughters of thanos definitely fight without reservations,3
627,it does pick up though and some of the characters don't even do anything in this movie,3
628,despite its solid lead from edward norton and liv tyler and i think the tone has a lot to offer,3
629,now this is not to say that this isn't going to factor in at all,3
630,it's not great like the original but it's still decent enough to be entertaining,3
631,not as goodthis is an entertaining film but it lacks in good storytelling and actingrating 70 %,3
632,the acting is good and the action scenes can get pretty inventive,3
633,stuff got done to them but they are all out to do the right thing by himself and his crew,3
634,the villains are easily forgettable whiplash got annoying at times some of the action is good but the story is really weak,3
635,and i wasn t impressed with the battle between the two sisters gamora and nebula reconciling after years of sibling rivalry,3
636,this film is good but i'm more into the next avengers one,3
637,also the scene at the end between hulk and abomination was so awesome,3
638,the humour felt forced and the visuals were weak for the first half or so and william hurt is pretty good,3
639,there's nothing in this film that sometimes overshadows everything else but it's easy to follow regardless,3
640,worth it as a light-hearted addition to the marvel family,3
641,the film is action packed and brilliantly scripted,3
642,the only problem i had with the film was that it acted as a prequel to the avengers then a iron man sequel,3
643,it was impossible for this movie to live up to the sam reni sprider-man 2,3
644,as the movie was over and even after watching it a second time i can see why people love this film,3
645,this was a fun family friendly movie with a lot of action and new characters with special powers,3
646,i love the visuals i love the action the visuals and the music,3
647,a good action flick but didn't quite get paul rudd,3
648,unlike other marvel movies this is one of the best movies of 2012,3
649,it might not be the complete movie but as an mcu event the culmination of ten years of filmmaking that has a remarkably ambitious vision,3
650,i was very happy with that end credits sequence and i wish i could be like him and have his powers,3
651,i must confess that iron man 3 is a fun entertaining film,3
652,with that said i can't say she's one of the best performances i have seen,3
653,there are plenty of good action scenes with the hulk leaves you not being able to get their way,3
654,i am happy to say that this isn't a bad thing,3
655,thank goodness he's the star of the film is an iron man film,3
656,the action sequences and special effects are pretty good and norton and roth give us great performances,3
657,man this should have been a great movie but it was full of some problems,3
658,very good addition to the iron man trilogy,3
659,thankfully it doesn't falter to the level of the other mcu franchises,3
660,the movie itself didn't amuse me as much as i thought it was pretty fun but it fizzled out at the end,3
661,needless to say this is the exact same thing as before but with a different villain,3
662,first one was better this one was decent if your a marvel fan you need to see this,3
663,the exposition is unnecessarily long and some of the characters in this movie have either nothing to do or are just bad,3
664,this was the real antagonist of iron man 2 but still pales in comparison with the previously released infinity war,3
665,robert downey jr's performance and the perfectly cast keaton,3
666,the fight scene on titan with thanos is the best action scene is probably the car-chase that happens mid-movie,3
667,iron man 2 is about as good as the dark nigth rises and gardians of the galaxys,3
668,yes for some reason the powers that be thought it would be at least a great movie,3
669,while the ego story is very interesting the fact that the villains are not very good,3
670,not the best mcu film it's right up there with the fifth element evil dead ii and buckaroo banzai,3
671,it is pretty easy to understand the story and the villain are dull and disappointing,3
672,better than the ang lee version of the hulk and this one is a big step forward from iron man 2,3
673,it undercuts the forward movement of the plot and it doesn't last long and the second time is probably shorter,3
674,however spider-man homecoming isn't the best spider-man yet michael keaton did a good job overall,3
675,the plot works well for the characters and world that the movie isn't an origin story in the slightest,3
676,i think edward norton did a fine job he just didn't do it for me as aldrich killian,3
677,solid performances throughout but as a whole it is certainly not great but it is fun,3
678,first of all i'd like to mention an issue that seems to be going through the motions forgettable but okay,3
679,maybe i'm just not that into hulk as a comic book movie so i don't expect an explanation of the quantum realm,3
680,even for the most dedicated fan like me this is kind of stupid and i'm getting very sick of it,3
681,i always enjoy a new story in a marvel movie but was just fine,3
682,lucky for marvel disney there is a justifiable reason for all of the hype even if it wasn't front and center here,3
683,i personally wanted this movie to focus more on other aspects it was overall a good film,3
684,it has some eye candy but the story and the villain are not really that good though,3
685,norton gives a 100 percent as bruce banner and liv tyler as betty ross,3
686,jon favreau once again delivers on the action and the plot was flimsy at times,3
687,it's the best marvel movie but the incredible hulk is a really good sequel although not as good as the first one,3
688,he's used to much greater effect as a side character which is where he should be,3
689,the third act like i said is one of the most boring super hero movies i've seen,3
690,things they got right it can not be denied that this is a huge step down from the original,3
691,a fun romp but don't expect it to replay fondly in your memories,3
692,i like how he acts and how he is grappling with the consequences of his choices as both a superhero and a father,3
693,this is a huge step down from the first avengers film one of the best,3
694,not as strong as the original but still a good one,3
695,their origin was obviously completely different from the comics but still dun to watch,3
696,so who are these guardians of the galaxy is a decent film,3
697,it can't beat iron man but the incredible hulk is an underwhelming anticlimactic adaptation of marvel's hulk,3
698,however calling it the worst mcu movie is a bit boring in certain parts,3
699,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the best in the film,3
700,it comes nowhere near close to the level of the other mcu franchises,3
701,the primary strength of the movie is very entertaining and somewhat,3
702,mostly just made me want to watch the movie go watch the movie,3
703,still black panther is not a bad movie but its flaws tend to show more often,3
704,the incredible hulk is somewhat an incomplete movie and a forgotten movie in the mcu where at least the whole world is not at stake,3
705,back in the 80s hank pym michael douglas and janet van dyne michelle pfeiffer lost for decades in the subatomic quantum realm,3
706,most importantly the film gives you a good dose of entertaining sometimes slightly forced humor,3
707,the 2010 follow up to 2008's iron man did a good job with character development esp supporting characters,3
708,this would emotionally invest the audience more when it comes to the interactions between the characters and their connections,3
709,undoubtedly the weakest in the franchise it features a talented cast,3
710,the guardians movies just seem to have a problem putting down the us,3
711,too many things going on at once too many characters and subplots a failing of far too many films in the mcu,3
712,volume 2 isn't as good as you'd expect from marvel humerous and highly entertaining,3
713,it is similar in tone to iron man 1 but it's not really mandatory viewing,3
714,just wasn't as good as people are saying to me but was there and had a good bag of action,3
715,this is a mid-level entry meant to be a solid popcorn movie but it's very nice to see,3
716,this reaches absurdity when at one point in the film this does make sense as i think he's doing ok,3
717,first this movie has not nearly as much heart as the previous film though not as good as first but still great,3
718,the antagonist in this movie is just bad,3
719,i was surprised that this movie did not capture the spark of the original but seems a bit less focused,3
720,boring disjointed and afraid to step out of his comfort zone in the suburbs where his webs don't have enough screen time to apprecite,3
721,it's a refreshingly fun and humorous marvel jaunt featuring one of the most exciting and original villians of the marvel movie-verse,3
722,while a definite improvement over its predecessor but still delivers good fun,3
723,in the end ant-man and the wasp has a lot of bad,3
724,although it's not as fresh as the original but has its moments,3
725,i like how it shows what iron man does when he does not try too hard to be funny,3
726,story could have been better the cast are great but there is no real climactic fight in this movie,3
727,first of all the villan was really good at the beginning of the film which was seeing all these heroes together and kicking ass,3
728,not as good as the first one and it became just another movie,3
729,i enjoyed the character development as well as the genuine fun which characterizes the mcu,3
730,age of ultron is one of the most successful movie of the year but it is definitely not the best,3
731,bigger and crazier than the first one but hey it's a sequel,3
732,it's larger and faster than iron man but it's most certainly not something they completely accomplished,3
733,the bit about the evil overlord thanos and the infinity stones but the fact that tony stark always fights villains that he has created himself,3
734,the movie is ok a lot of action and new characters with special powers,3
735,a movie on its own in my opinion the weakest of the mcu films due to the twist regarding the mandarin is pretty fantastic,3
736,well i think this is probably the weakest cinematic universe movie that doesn't work is the performance,3
737,while not as good as the first one but still plenty of entertainment,3
738,i di not want to watch this as i thought it was going to be awesome and a ton of wisecracks,3
739,although the characters are relatively interesting there know where near enough action in this movie was some of the best action of the film,3
740,i think it's good but not as good as the first one but not bad either,3
741,not a great addition to the marvel film series,3
742,some useless subplots which don't really have a desire to watch it again,3
743,again i repeat i liked the twist i really did and i really like the humour and pace of the movie enjoyable,3
744,i never thought i would want another spider-man 3 resonates with me more than this film,3
745,his performance is solid and he does a fine job here,3
746,not reaching the heights of the first iron man but it still had many imperfections,3
747,i remember going to see the first iron man stick out to me,3
748,i happily give guardians of the galaxy is a decent film,3
749,the only reason falcon is in the movie is the closest we will get to a disney marvel b-movie,3
750,the beginning of this film is a bit too long,3
751,brand me a racist if you want i can't say she's one of the better mcu villains,3
752,while i don't enjoy superhero movies i had to watch the trailer again to recall seeing it,3
753,i wouldn't watch it twice and it really didn't have so much drama around it,3
754,so how nice it is to be able to say that this movie is a part of the beloved avengers,3
755,but i wish this was better than ang lee's earlier effort at directing a hulk feature film,3
756,but they made it and after seeing it i've to say that i hated ty simpkins character i felt his role was unnecessary,3
757,not as good as the first movie but it still is a good time for sure but not good either,3
758,the avengers are much more organised combine better and the action is good but the showdown action scenes between him and hulk,3
759,it's not as good as the first movie but that doesn't mean it's bad,3
760,all in all it's an alright addition to the marvel family original story new characters great cast,3
761,but it was nice to see a splendid space opera again,3
762,i'll probably watch the next one thought as i am sure there is going to be important come avengers 4,3
763,it's another necessary stepping stone in the marvel universe though i don't know why that is,3
764,kurt russel was wonderful in his role as ant-man and the wasp,3
765,so much better than i thought i would,3
766,read a lot of reviews before purchasing this movie and it managed to deliver on many levels,3
767,no doubt tobey maguire spider-man is now part of the marvel cinematic universe but definitely not the weakest as well,3
768,all in all if you like superhero movies or action movies i would recommend seeing captain america civil war before watching black panther,3
769,during his first transformation bruce seriously injured his girlfriend betty ross liv tyler and forced to hide from his nemesis gen,3
770,how they went from small to big and when it was it wasn't as big and action packed as other super hero movies,3
771,after seeing the first one one just realized that the sequel is not as good as avengers infinity war or as groundbreaking as black panther,3
772,worth it as a light-hearted addition to the marvel family original story new characters great cast,3
773,of course with it being a sequel it isn't as impactful as the first one,3
774,with that being said i would be lying if i said i wasn't somewhat disappointed,3
775,this is one of the better mcu villains,3
776,that was a good scene but not good enough for the characters sake,3
777,more clever then the first one but overall it's an entertaining watch,3
778,secondly and even more surprisingly is the fact that he's still just 15 years old,3
779,it's not confusing mind you just busy and overlong at the expense of crowding the movie a bit much,3
780,and we spend the rest of the cast as well,3
781,gwneyth paltrow and jon favreau are all excellent,3
782,let's just hope there isn't a whole lot of chatter and not a whole lot of cohesion between these different story elements,3
783,he said homecoming is the kind of power he has,3
784,he was bullied by movie goers because this movie didn't have that it was joke after joke after joke,3
785,i have revisited this film and i don't think this is as bad as everyone lets on,3
786,bigger and crazier than the first one but not bad either,3
787,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but not necessarily a memorable one,3
788,just like iron man 2 the third still lacks the eye widening thrills of the first entry but above the overstuffed but still enjoyable second,3
789,the 3d version of the film was just meh to me,3
790,not the best sequel in the mcu since iron man 2,3
791,again this is a comic book movie and just a good movie in general,3
792,which does remind me of one problem i had with the new characters was also really good to see,3
793,also the relationship between liv tyler's betty ross however occurs almost abruptly,3
794,it feels like more of the same well but the plot and the villain are dull and disappointing,3
795,after the tone and events of infinity war seemed like it wouldn't work,3
796,iron man 2 has some cool action and definitely gets you excited for the avengers movies on the horizon,3
797,this movie survives on political premise alone not a bad movie but a pretty big disappointment,3
798,i also feel the anxiety is handled excellently in the first half and forgive it's many similarities to iron man,3
799,iron man 2 is still a good time at the cinema,3
800,the cast was good amp the end credit scene is pretty darn cool,3
801,truth be told i yawned a lot but it was not supposed to be the best marvel movie,3
802,i myself really didn't have anything to do with the fact that he's still just 15 years old,3
803,surely it brings back some of the successful elements from the first one with this movie being a giant commercial for the avengers,3
804,i for one didn't leave guardians of the galaxy proved what marvel can really do with a license,3
805,also it was funny the first one or many of the other marvel characters but something was just missing here,3
806,don cheadle does his part in iron man 3 but the majority of the set pieces 1000 % better than the hulk movie from 2003,3
807,overall this isn't a good film it's not up with everything else,3
808,i think iron man 3 is still an entertaining film saved by the witty humor of the iron man suits in action,3
809,while it may lack in depth or even character development the incredible hulk is another good marvel movie that changes the template,3
810,the theme hits too hard and some of the later action sequences are jaw-dropping,3
811,michelle pfeiffer isn't on screen enough and i don't like edward norton as bruce banner,3
812,another racy movie though but doesn't live up to the hype in my opinion,3
813,despite it's flaws it was a fun movie but not a good one,3
814,iron man 2 is about as good as the first one which i loved,3
815,perhaps that had something to do with the avengers we saw back in 2012,3
816,it is way better than the 1st film,3
817,otherwise the action is good but the showdown action scenes between him and hulk,3
818,25 5peyton reed delivers an average film but he doesn't really have too much to do,3
819,the villain obadiah is pure evil i just don't like or care for vision paul bettany,3
820,3 and the amazing spider-man 2 are all better films than this,3
821,this also would have people expect that ant-man and the wasp is the worst marvel movie though,3
822,the antagonist in this movie is one of the premier comic book films of our age,3
823,the thing that doesn't hold up to repeat viewing,3
824,during his first transformation bruce seriously injured his girlfriend betty ross liv tyler and forced to hide from his nemesis gen,3
825,i would not agree with the consensus that this is not quite as good as the original but has its moments,3
826,2017 update incredible hulk does not hold up very well which i find is a common flaw with most marvel movies,3
827,spider-man homecoming isn't the best one ever made,3
828,of course i'd have to say that it's a side-character-michael peãâ±a-who steals the show,3
829,and still the dark knight powers on as the best superhero movie i've seen but still enjoyable,3
830,other than that it felt like it was missing in 3,3
831,a fun moive but no where as good as other marvel but not bad,3
832,what they did with some of the best ever seen in a superhero movie,3
833,it does not move as fast as it should and therefore feels very wasted and like botched potential,3
834,an improvement over its predecessor but still delivers good fun,3
835,ultron is a great villain and one of the best parts of this iron man movie,3
836,but in all seriousness i can't see anyone play him,3
837,im going to see this movie it looked so good,3
838,now as i said at the beginning this movie wasn't as excited as the first avengers,3
839,i know this isn't a good film it's not up with everything else,3
840,anti-man plays a pivotal role in shaping the marvel cinematic universe,3
841,iron man 2 isn't as good as i expected it to be but the movie still lacks a good villian and original plot,3
842,but its still breathtaking and every scene is action packed and introduces some interesting characters there isn't a whole lot of sense,3
843,i feel joss whedon really listened to a few of the characters are really cliche oh a girl who can punch,3
844,we've seen black panther in civil war and gets played out quickly in this film but that tragedy needs humour to balance it,3
845,decent enough though not a lot put towards the main villain of the film was just distinctive enough from the previous spider-men,3
846,that constant sense of a shared landscape long a cornerstone of the comic book movies but it turnout to be the same as the rest,3
847,as a film it's not up with everything else,3
848,overall i had so much fun watching this movie but i enjoyed it just as much as the first or the origin story,3
849,kind of luckluster on repeat viewings which is a shame because narratively this one holds some interesting developments,3
850,2018-6-15 better than i thought it was a bit too overrated but fun to watch,3
851,as far as issues go iron man is a great edition to the mcu,3
852,michelle pfeiffer is a damn-fine addition to the mcu it was a fun movie and a fun time,3
853,well this is a much better james rhodes war machine with an all-star cast manages to deliver a hilarious and surprisingly emotional movie,3
854,a better instalment than the original with a great villain and one of the better mcu villains,3
855,it does not live up to the hype in my opinion,3
856,this movie was entertaining but not as good as iron man but i'm not upset by what we did get,3
857,the build up to him wearing was a cool villain but there is no real climactic fight in this movie,3
858,the action is nothing you haven't seen before and despite the villain's motivations in this one are so poorly done,3
859,granted it's not a bad thing,3
860,it's almost more of a heist comedy film this is the one for you,3
861,entertaining as ever even if it is a small amount,3
862,seems to have a similar impression especially at the beginning and end and both times he is dispatched way too easily,3
863,at least modern family's ty burrell is in this movie though i don't know if i will ever not be satisfied,3
864,the climax is fun but not nearly as good as it could have been better if marvel gave director jon favreau more time,3
865,most importantly the film gives you a good dose of entertaining sometimes slightly forced humor,3
866,stunningly beautiful again but lacking something that made the first volume gel so well,3
867,i remember having so much fun watching this movie but i enjoyed it just as much as the last hulk film but it was okay,3
868,once again downey knocks it out of the way this movie is so fun,3
869,whilst i agree with ed norton that this could have been the greatest action movie ever,3
870,a pretty solid spider-man movie it's still worth a watch though,3
871,for the first time back in 2012 i didn't think she pulled off a great performance here in my opinion,3
872,this film picks up after the events of avengers but i think there was something missing,3
873,it definitely attempted to tell a more character-driven story to it the action quotient gets lost along the way,3
874,a good movie but not as the other two villains from the original movies,3
875,a very witty film especially any scene that involved iron man but it is still exciting and does a fine job here,3
876,sure the plot isn't the strongest of the mcu bunch,3
877,a fantastic edition to marvel's cinematic universe is becoming noticeably by-the-numbers movie,3
878,this film is good but i'm more into the next avengers one,3
879,age of ultron still manages to be incredibly fun to watch,3
880,it may be more entertaining than the first ant-man film follows on directly from captain america civil war,3
881,bottom line even though it's not as hilarious as many people say,3
882,it could be a nice movie if it wasn't for the last 45 minutes of the movie are pretty great all things considered,3
883,it is unfortunately let down by a stumbling third act,3
884,while straying from the tone of the movie and the rest of the mcu save for wolverine,3
885,not sure what it's missing but it just didn't appeal to me as much as the first but still a really fun movie,3
886,don cheadle is a better replacement for rhodes and has more of a humorous tilt than most in the mcu,3
887,for the most part i didn't care 4 in the least,3
888,however the action is the show stopper in this film and i'll address all of the major ones,3
889,has a lot of humor to entertain us and for the most part fits well into the film,3
890,however it is overcrowded and serves more as a commercial for the mcu or future tony stark avengers films,3
891,a decent remake which isn't too special but still an enjoyable romp,3
892,he feels he's held back by iron man so he wanted to make a action comedy movie with robert downey jr,3
893,the way thanos so easily gets some of the infinity stones and he is in a body of water,3
894,bruce banner is transformed into the hulk a green 10-foot monster of uncontrollable rage,3
895,good but not up to par with the other marvel movies to watch and understand this,3
896,i liked the idea behind the plot of the sequel as the first but fun,3
897,really though there's not much you can say about this one,3
898,the film is spectacular it's a little more serious at times but i loved him in the movie,3
899,it is not as good as iron man,3
900,by its very nature the stakes in ant-man it is michael douglas,3
901,with some great action sequences that make up for a lot of what worked in the first film,3
902,i could give you a quick rundown of the plot but i keep wondering how do people find this entertaining,3
903,there's nothing in this film that sometimes overshadows everything else but it's easy to follow regardless,3
904,however i still find the action pretty generic and the story to be a little more than just the friendly neighborhood superhero,3
905,the effects were amazing and looked awesome i wouldn't say it's the best at letting michael rooker be amazing that's for sure,3
906,my only problems with this movie is the movie that truly brings out the marvel cinematic universe but it's missing something,3
907,the final battle in the city is cool but there's nothing special about it other than the setting and its cast,3
908,i hope things get resolved in the next one and leave out the racism,3
909,not reaching the heights of the first iron man iron man 2 has both good things and bad things but worth watching,3
910,a fun romp but don't expect a great superhero movie and i'm having trouble understanding all the hype and i love marvel movies,3
911,volume 2 succeeds in its capacity as a sequel but otherwise it's a good action movie,3
912,not bad not great not spider-man but was not fond of the story,3
913,thanos cant save this from being a terrific spider-man story,3
914,not one of my favorites but it was still a riot and an action-packed film for spidey fans of all ages,3
915,a joyful comedy romp that is nowhere near as good as the first and third movies in the series but still an overall good film,3
916,because of the breezy tone and familiar plotting there isn't much to be said about this that can't be said for the sequel,3
917,the first avengers movie but i thought it could have been better though,3
918,i need to clarify the main reason why this film worked,3
919,it's going to be back by the end of the day their characters are a waste,3
920,edward norton is banner hulk in this film and is probably the best to play spider-man so much,3
921,the avengers is the first team-up film in the mcu and this movie really shows you how far cgi has come,3
922,as a standalone this is a great movie for the whole family,3
923,paul rudd is well cast for a hero that has more of a firm grasp of the character,3
924,didn't have that spark it was more slow and i felt like i was on a disney ride at epcot or something,3
925,while this chapter isn't nearly as good as the first film and it is narratively all over the place,3
926,the characters are fine for the most part a forgettable action movie,3
927,uneven pacing keeps this from being one of marvel's stronger movies but it's certainly not boring though,3
928,even though this film is not as good as other marvel but not bad,3
929,it's enjoyable with a great performance from robert downey jr,3
930,quill has a lot of great character moments and i feel like that was a bad creative move,3
931,although the characters are relatively interesting there know where near enough action in this movie is one of the simpler stories,3
932,i was hoping for the magic of the first by injecting way too much humor which is such a waste of talent,3
933,this movie is good but definetly not the best marvel movie ever and for some people they may see it that way,3
934,its main downfalls were that it was incredibly formulaic and the villain was weak as well as a comedy about being a dad,3
935,75%saw this on 28 11 15ant-man is one of the best marvel's to come out in theatres it looks unsurprisinly amazing,3
936,as intellectual as iron man 3 is an entertaining entry into the mcu,3
937,the vision was amazing he was probably my favorite as a fan,3
938,bottom line even though it's not as good as the first one but a welcomed sequel,3
939,to sum it up iron man 3 is so different from the first two,3
940,on top of that the structure of the script because it is not a perfect movies,3
941,its not amazing but its a pretty good movie even though it was touching it didn't really fit the character,3
942,and really a big part of this movie,3
943,a great film for one coming out of the marvel cinematic universe in my opinion,3
944,despite being one of the weakest marvel movies,3
945,hyde story to run with backingfrom the success of the first avengers film but it is in no way incredible,3
946,the largest complaint i have is that peter quill our main hero is a disappointment,3
947,unfortunately this is just a starting point for some rather big things to come,3
948,a lot better than ang lee's version or the avengers's version,3
949,plenty of good ideas and a story that is very sub-par to the first movie,3
950,overall a good movie but the plot needs direction and a better villain,3
951,good but not as good as the first iron man film like the story character development and actoin,3
952,it's more grounded than one would expect but the incredible hulk is thrilling fun and intriguing,3
953,and how come this film doesn't capture some of the fun aspects of the first film and the characters still work great together,3
954,it is unfortunately let down by a weak second half,3
955,rourke is a great addition as the villain and it's all over just as soon as it came into the third act,3
956,the story was good but could have been better in major aspects but it's not enough to keep you going,3
957,i was surprised that they changed star-lord's father's home planet,3
958,this film is ok no where near as good as the first film or some of the other marvel movies,3
959,there's a perfunctory showdown with a supervillain in the third act with endless action and fight sequences,3
960,i will say it's better than the 3rd movie,3
961,even though ayesha and her golden people are a major subplot i didn't even heard scott lang until i look him up,3
962,slightly more fun if less thoughtful than ang lee's hulk but still not what i wan't from a hulk film,3
963,it's enjoyable with a great performance from robert downey jr,3
964,iron man 2 might not be one of the best and funniest parts of the film remain underdone while other parts deliver,3
965,but they take up so much time of the film despite him being the primary artist in charge of the film,3
966,iron man 3 is an improvement over the previous iron man films it's still one of the best of mcu,3
967,full of non-stop fast-paced action with great acting which is what this is,3
968,by far better then the more recent hulk film but it is fun and works within the inner logic of the series,3
969,marvel shows yet another comedy-action film in the mcu but it had all the charm of the first,3
970,good but not up to par with iron man or the avengers but a solid super hero movie,3
971,not up to the heights of the first iron man,3
972,im going to see this movie it looked so good,3
973,i didn't enjoy this one as much as the first one although it has some fun scenes,3
974,best film of the trilogy than iron man 2 but this film was missing jon favreau's touch,3
975,back in the 80s hank pym michael douglas and janet van dyne michelle pfeiffer lost for decades in the subatomic quantum realm,3
976,i love the plane scene and it's the best marvel movie not just iron man,3
977,i will say that it could have been so much better,3
978,at the same time feels like he's one of the weaker films that marvel has produced in the more recent years,3
979,that's not to say that he fails,3
980,not as good as the first movie but it still has its charm from its ever powerful yet damaged tony stark,3
981,i personally prefer the first one but still a solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe then,3
982,but ant-man and the wasp is by no means the masterpiece it is regarded as,3
983,overlook all that however accept am amp tw for what it is which in itself is a quality worthy of more praise,3
984,i thought the first ant-man but also the problem for marvel universe,3
985,of course this movie has problems but this is one of the premier comic book films of our age,3
986,but i was expecting big things the first time around as i'm not a big hulk fan,3
987,naturally when a sequel was announced it had to fill the big picture that links all these characters to the infinity stones,3
988,it was good but i was bothered by internal inconsistencies between the iron man films and this overblown sequel is pointless,3
989,and it's definitely way better than the othr one a few yrs ago,3
990,i enjoyed it in the end so that's not a bad movie i was just hoping for more,3
991,let's go down to the rest of the cast is great also the action is way too busy,3
992,boring at times but still a very enjoyable and fun film,3
993,i think iron man 3 is not the most satisfying conclusion to the trilogy this is not near enough to be a end,3
994,it didn't completely ruin the movie but it couldn't break free of the weight of it's own direction,3
995,his old partner hope van dyne evangeline lilly and dr,3
996,full of non-stop fast-paced action with great acting which is what this is,3
997,the plot was not the best i thought it was entertaining enough to see at least once,3
998,as is usually the case with the mcu however age of ultron is still worthy of being a good film,3
999,despite being the weakest film of the mcu but not enough to overshadow it,3
1000,sam rockwell as justin hammer is the best part of the flick is keaton as the vulture,3
1001,it wasn't quite as good as the first film which is a shame as the original ideas behind this character are really intriguing,3
1002,this one really looks better then the first hulk movie better because it's more realistic,3
1003,not enough care was put into the details of the film despite him being the primary artist in charge of the film,3
1004,a pretty great movie with a nice story,3
1005,good but not up to the same standard as the first and some confusing back story references but it will keep you entertained,3
1006,betty ross played by liv tyler great actress but i didn't think that the story was all that special,3
1007,clever adaptation of the spider-man character has ever received,3
1008,the new villain ultron is by far the better of the two,3
1009,the cgi is really bad and there are moments that make no sense,3
1010,it is not only the problem for ant-man and the wasp is by no means the masterpiece it is regarded as,3
1011,not as crisp as the first outing but still an entertaining addition that does not stray to far from the formula,3
1012,had a low expectation for this movie and i'll give it a quick eye roll and accept it,3
1013,he doesn't pose much of a threat as stane from the first iron man movie,3
1014,when you watch the final battle in the third act with endless action and fight sequences,3
1015,the visual effects and entertainment wise the second live-action spider-man was one of the weaker mcu villains unfortunately,3
1016,the main problem with the movie is that there isn't a sequel,3
1017,action but also have a lot of fun with some great performances and visuals,3
1018,the first avengers film one of the best characters in the movie,3
1019,however it is better the the stupid fantastic four movies and the first hulk movie to succeed unlike the 2003 version,3
1020,this was my favorite of the three but i can't stand how most guys enjoy watching this kinda movie,3
1021,it is unfortunately let down by a stumbling third act,3
1022,avengers age of ultron was actually quite disappointing but that doesn't go anywhere until winter soldier,3
1023,overall this isn't a bad movie it's just another iron man movie,3
1024,then again given the mesmerising character from the first movie is more darker amp serious than the sequel,3
1025,antman and the wasp though better than the original although this movie is a breath of fresh air and an improvement from recent marvel films,3
1026,it's got clever action the comedy is on point and the cast is great also the action is great it's still very fun,3
1027,two scenes from the first iron man 3 is a pretty good film which packs many great surprises,3
1028,didn't need the gold people in the end battle he unleashes them on killian's men,3
1029,a well-made movie with characters you care about are put to the test in interesting ways,3
1030,they did pretty good juggling so many characters and has a worthy but cliched villain,3
1031,2 surpasses all expectations and is far better than a lot of other marvel sequels,3
1032,ultron is a great villain and one of the better super hero films to date,3
1033,a mostly cliche superhero film although showing the hulk as a character but missing his former state too,3
1034,a dissapointing sequel to one of their best,3
1035,the final action scene certainly makes up for that 2003 hulk movie we all pretend didn't happen,3
1036,a few more things i liked about ant-man was being set up to ultimately be a part of the beloved avengers,3
1037,overall i am glad that i went to see it two hour later i came out of the theater after the film was over,3
1038,loved tom holland as spider-man and andrew garfield's spider-man,3
1039,loved the avengers tie-in scene so well probably see ant-man in the movies is just beginning,3
1040,i especially love the effects of the quantum realm that abides by real-world physical concepts,3
1041,i liked it only because it was better than ang lee's hulk but that's still not really saying much,3
1042,2 feels like a step backwards from the original with eric bana,3
1043,the visuals are awesome but the action is one notch higher,3
1044,gwyneth paltrow also creates a good flow of chemistry with robert downey jr and sam rockwell battling it out for the scene stealer,3
1045,however the story was very strong and the movie deserves 74 %,3
1046,mark ruffalo is much better than ed norton as bruce banner the hulk in this second installment into the marvel movie universe,3
1047,spider-man homecoming is the first filmic spider-man to ever leap onto the big screen,3
1048,that's not to say that iron man isn't a ton of fun and adding kurt russell was great,3
1049,i had one hell of a fun ride,3
1050,entertaining as ever even if it is a small amount,3
1051,and then in iron man 2 but iron man 3 he was just a one note stereotype that's been seen time and time again,3
1052,there is a bigger focus on comedy this time around and it's refreshing that the villain is kinda weak and uninspiring,3
1053,marvel's the avengers is one of the best of mcu,3
1054,what can i say i finally watched the avengers and it's a lot less fun the first chapter,3
1055,im sure im in the minority but i really didn't think i would like this movie,3
1056,if you're a fan of the first one this one is bit meh,3
1057,sure in my opinion he can be a reliable leading man,3
1058,it did just as good of a job as terrence howard in the role of obadiah stane and war machine isn't in the movie,3
1059,i will watch it as long as its better than the first two but still lacks originality,3
1060,as entertaining as this movie is it's not as good and the villain doesn't get enough screen time,3
1061,however i realized that this was a big deal to peter but i don't remember specifics,3
1062,5 4 2017 2 a great movie and part 2 cool,3
1063,it still contains enjoyable sequences like every iron man film but it could have been a whole lot worse,3
1064,however liv tyler made up for it and the film had the marvel kryptonite lol which is the crappy villians,3
1065,ugh what can i say i finally watched the avengers and it's a decent movie but come on,3
1066,preferred it the first time i watched it but it's still fun to watch,3
1067,this movie is visually impressive but the story isn't as focused or compelling as that of the first film and robert downey jr,3
1068,i just didn't connect with this one like i did the first ant man as much as i gave it credit to before,3
1069,but for the most part i didn't care much for mr,3
1070,one of the studios poorest efforts ant-man and this one was on the same level of quality as mark ruffalo,3
1071,another marvel film i didn't care much for mr,3
1072,first this movie has not nearly as much heart as the previous film though not as good as the first film,3
1073,this is a movie that is essentially the exact same thing i would say this is the best marvel movie but it's not terrible,3
1074,fun to watch and there are also some awesome action sequences and even a few surprises iron man 3 is still an entertaining story,3
1075,2 is only 11 minutes longer than its predecessor but not quite as good as in the first film,3
1076,it just didn't have the same punch as the first but still a great offering in the iron man franchise,3
1077,and how else to start but with one of the best performances i have seen,3
1078,there's just too much going on at one time during the climax of the film feels rather familiar,3
1079,other than the film is part of the marvel cinematic universe occasionally walks the fine line of almost becoming too convoluted,3
1080,the director purposely planned this movie to be more colorful than exciting or humorous,3
1081,spiderman homecoming is a mixed bag it has the same feel as the other super hero movies,3
1082,i loved every character in the movie that are good,3
1083,downey jr is such great casting that it's hard to live up to the sam reni sprider-man 2,3
1084,while avengers age of ultron was a good movie nothing to special,3
1085,it's all in all still a solid addition to the marvel cinematic universe's stronger outings but it's a fun watch,3
1086,the third act like i said is one of the marvel films that would follow it,3
1087,i don't remember much but it was pretty forgettable like most mcu scores,3
1088,every single actor on screen is having a ton of fun though i still love ang lee's version,3
1089,the villains are easily forgettable whiplash got annoying at times some of the action scenes were good and evangeline lilly killed it as the wasp,3
1090,most choose to just ignore that this movie was made by one man,3
1091,the final battle in the city is cool but there's nothing clever new or memorable about it,3
1092,also while aaron taylor johnson is great as quicksilver he's not as funny as i was led to believe,3
1093,or they should have ant man in the next avengers movie i'm figuring that will happen during thor,3
1094,the film is not necessarily so in this film they focused the attention where it should be,3
1095,read a lot of reviews before purchasing this movie and it managed to deliver on many levels,3
1096,kicking off the second phase of the marvel cinematic universe this is the second film in the mcu,3
1097,don't be put off by the lack of action scenes preety much an enjoyable movie,3
1098,i kept thinking throughout this movie that the first one had by introducing a clear villain for iron man to battle,3
1099,i mostly recommend you watch this film when you haven't invested much in it that irritation becomes dangerously off-putting,3
1100,they tried to make ultron like loki in this movie which is a surprise cause i am not a spidey fan,3
1101,on the other hand there is not a lot of action and some really cool action,3
1102,an improvement over its predecessor while being slightly surpassed by the original iron man and by the best film of the year so far,3
1103,i remember going to see the first iron man 3 is an interesting film for me,3
1104,i still think it's an illegal weapon,3
1105,solid follow-up to ant-man's powers in action however rather generic formula as far as the steps executed,3
1106,i felt this movie had a lot of fun considering marvel is now focused more on comedy,3
1107,but back to the positives while i wouldn't call it fresh or groundbreaking but this movie is still very enjoyable,3
1108,iron man 2 is clearly a movie that has to accommodate an estimated 76 characters it was pretty good when it's not,3
1109,but somewhat of a misstep that they resolved in iron man 3 and i think the tone has a lot to offer,3
1110,the hulk here is pretty good but he's not as funny as i was led to believe,3
1111,gog always felt a little wierd as compared to the rest of the cast fight a giant space creature,3
1112,after the disappointing avengers age of ultron ant-man was being set up to ultimately be a part of the beloved avengers,3
1113,as far as issues go iron man is a very confident movie and has every reason to be,3
1114,this movie was the first movie in time not to mention it would have made little difference,3
1115,it's a good movie but the weakest of the mcu films to date,3
1116,this is a movie that is essentially the exact same thing i would say this is the best marvel movie evar,3
1117,it's not as good as the first guardians movie but this one was still very good,3
1118,see hollywood a super-hero movie which surprised me,3
1119,the trailers and the first half of iron man 3 the actors are given some effective material to work with,3
1120,entertaining a total crowd-pleaser and everybody is clearly having a good time at the movies thanks to the juiciness of robert downey jr,3
1121,iron man 2 was a worthy follow up to the avengers this one was definitely the weakest,3
1122,the choice of yellowjacket for antagonist was solid as well and the hulk as always is the balls,3
1123,however this fast-paced and funny but i wouldn't avoid it it's a good movie,3
1124,because spider-man homecoming is a great film about tony stark and iron man,3
1125,but in the end this film is just above average with an ok cast,3
1126,overall there isn't much to talk about as the incredible hulk is an ok entry in this universe,3
1127,can you dear reader remember an original song from a marvel film like the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
1128,overall i had so much fun watching the first movie but better than the second and robert downey jr,3
1129,it's not confusing mind you just busy and overlong at the expense of crowding the movie a bit much,3
1130,kurt russel was wonderful in his role as ant-man will mix with the rest of the film,3
1131,it's as good as the first avengers film but it is fun and works within the inner logic of the series,3
1132,it could have been better but it wasn't a directed by edgar wright is still pretty good,3
1133,age of ultron is a lot funnier and action packed than the first oh and also more hulk,3
1134,and the scenes where he saves peter kind of ruined the intensity of the mcu ant-man remains at home during his house arrest,3
1135,2 offers a unique offer of action humor and music even if it doesn't really do much more than that,3
1136,the film lacksthe flair i'm sure everyone would be expecting and while it's not as hilarious as many people say,3
1137,but it would have been much better than it was,3
1138,a pretty great movie with a nice story,3
1139,if they work on the cgi better on the fight scene in the end it just doesn't lead anywhere or amount to much,3
1140,ant-man and the wasp is the second ant-man movie should be,3
1141,its car chases through the streets of south korea are frankly the most exciting and original villians of the marvel movie-verse,3
1142,ant-man is besides the fact that it is a fun step back,3
1143,he's kind of the heart of the film and it would have made little difference,3
1144,the guardians don't really do much for me,3
1145,spider-man homecoming is the first filmic spider-man to ever leap onto the big screen,3
1146,what humour there is falls flat and edward norton is a good hulk movie better than the ang lee version,3
1147,it's pretty good as a spider-man fan it bothers me,3
1148,like many superhero movies iron man 3 has a plot twist,3
1149,this angry mcu reboot boasts great action amp cgi within the course of the movie he just isn't given that much to do,3
1150,that way the movie is a fast paced entertaining sequel to the original film but maybe trying too hard to be funny,3
1151,going into this movie i thought it was a bit boring a bit confusing and a bit underwhelming,3
1152,still black panther is not a bad movie but a pretty big disappointment,3
1153,i bought it and liked it a lot just thought it would be at least a great movie,3
1154,but in the end this film is just above average with an ok cast,3
1155,but all in all it's a pretty darn good time at the cinema but it really isn't anything more than that,3
1156,don't get me wrong i love to laugh and most of this movie was a wash rinse and repeat scenario in my opinion,3
1157,i will say it's better than iron man 2 which barely achieved place mat status,3
1158,so who are these guardians of the galaxy to fill the big shoes of its predecessor,3
1159,2 overcome some of its problems is the fact that tony stark is not in an iron man suit,3
1160,but small doesn't mean that it's a good summer movie,3
1161,it does not move as fast as it should and therefore feels very wasted and like botched potential,3
1162,the last act is boring and the cgi is really good but whiplash is a terrible villain,3
1163,downey jr is such great casting that it's hard to find much to meaningfully hone in on and relate to,3
1164,in every way the incredible hulk is an underrated movie,3
1165,although iron man 3 has our charismatic hero that we all love the music in this movie but nothing more,3
1166,i like paul rudd and in his role as ego with the rest of the marvel family,3
1167,meh its like the first one but still pretty good,3
1168,unfortunately this film have a visual effects that are blended into fun action scenes,3
1169,i enjoyed the character development as well as the genuine fun which characterizes the mcu,3
1170,but all in all it's a good movie but not the best iron man yet,3
1171,i felt like i really began to understand the characters and what they are actually saying,3
1172,cool scenes of hulk smashing things real good,3
1173,had a low expectation for this movie is killing me,3
1174,at the end of the first iron man but it still had many imperfections,3
1175,rudd is well cast for a hero that has more of a firm grasp of the character,3
1176,besides the many jokes it had heart and was a good story and mixed plot makes this movie am average one,3
1177,the air force one free-fall scene was really fun to watch and ed norton has enough acting skills to play anything,3
1178,a joyful comedy romp that is nowhere near as good as the original but still this is pretty good fun,3
1179,the first half of the film wasn't that interesting either,3
1180,while the reboot of the hulk franchise and it's a shame too,3
1181,better than iron man 2 and thor the dark world but it's nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be,3
1182,not nearly as fun as the movie is as good as it could have been better,3
1183,great visuals and great performance by paul rudd and michael douglas,3
1184,plenty of good ideas and a story that is very sub-par to the first movie,3
1185,not as good as iron man was but the incredible hulk is marvel's second movie but certainly not one of their best,3
1186,with so-so special effects poor cinematography too much action and cgi in the movie is the military-like ensemble of five guardians,3
1187,sequel to the first iron man iron man 2 is still an exciting action film and robert downey jr,3
1188,the ultimate adventure of armored it's still not as good as sam raimi's spidey films,3
1189,good for a laugh but pales in comparison to the original iron man 2 still brings us the wonderful character robert downey jr,3
1190,the plot was sort of a rescue mission and i guess it worked but was a step back,3
1191,a fantastic edition to marvel's cinematic universe is becoming noticeably by-the-numbers origin story,3
1192,i wasn't too excited about this one when it came out but at that time i haven't seen the dark knight,3
1193,while not as good as the first one just fell flat,3
1194,the cgi is really bad and there are moments that make no sense,3
1195,although this film doesn't reference the events of iron man 3 the actors are given some effective material to work with,3
1196,don't expect too much and you'll enjoy this for it's purpose keep em coming back,3
1197,but is still good i guess the main problem with the mcu movies and it's generic story,3
1198,while holding strong themes the plot was all over the place still entertaining but the worst of the franchise,3
1199,as far as issues go iron man is a great edition to the mcu,3
1200,it is another spider-man movie is that it's not even the second best spider-man yet,3
1201,luckily gog is an action-packed film for spidey fans of all ages,3
1202,the fact that peter parker has already been spider-man for two months at the film's start,3
1203,however flaws aside this is a fun entertaining film,3
1204,not quite but this is one of the best solo superhero movies from marvel,3
1205,all in all i think this is probably the weakest cinematic universe movie that doesn't work is the performance,3
1206,downey as iron man was great iron man 2 was quite a fun movie to watch,3
1207,kurt russel's character was too much and the end of the day isn't a horrible movie,3
1208,not the best marvel movie but its good,3
1209,a ok film can't be better then the first one but it has impressive action scenes and great acting from rdj,3
1210,speaking of funny the film does have mild comedy but it's not what we're getting from marvel films,3
1211,while corey stoll gave a great performance though it's nothing we haven't seen before from this character at least,3
1212,oh and the villain yellowjacket is just about the correct age and looks it,3
1213,a potentially powerful story had it not been a marvel property in recent history that hasn't been directed by jon favreau,3
1214,entertaining enough retread of the first film in the franchise,3
1215,great cast great action and a passable villain,3
1216,because of the breezy tone and familiar plotting there isn't much to be said about this movie it's bland in every way,3
1217,even though same as many other marvel movies but it's easy to follow regardless,3
1218,the movie had a really good storyline it also had a lot of holes even by super hero plot standards,3
1219,going into this movie i thought it was going to be awesome and a ton of wisecracks,3
1220,not quite but this is one of their lesser movies to be sure but it was a masterpiece of cgi,3
1221,a potentially powerful story had it not been a marvel property in recent history that hasn't been objectively a massive success,3
1222,the first one is one of the better ones out of the mcu's best villians and one of my favoret,3
1223,various kinds of some easter eggs have become one of the most complete pieces of entertainment of the year,3
1224,it comes nowhere near close to the level of other films that did the same thing but it's still decent enough to be entertaining,3
1225,entertaining but one of the weakest in the trilogy underutilized villain and aspects of the film especially one intended for youthful audiences,3
1226,was a little confused as to the concept of this film and feel it deserves more credit than it receives,3
1227,does their second outing together live up to the original like toy story,3
1228,while not the worst movie in the iron man suit,3
1229,they tried to make him tell jokes and i feel like the plot could have been better under edgar wright,3
1230,i bought it and liked it a lot just thought it would be at least a great movie,3
1231,so it's pretty safe to say that ant man amp the wasp manages to be what the first ant-man movie,3
1232,the theme hits too hard and some of the later action sequences are jaw-dropping,3
1233,the movie isn't as good as i'd hoped,3
1234,it really didn't bring anything that we haven't seen before from this character at least,3
1235,ed norton is the perfect choice for ant-man who can be done well,3
1236,very noticeably pg-13 film with some of the guardians joining in late,3
1237,after his battle with the avengers in berlin peter parker returns home to live with his aunt,3
1238,this 2008 film was never very popular which is why i give this movie a 3 out of 5 stars,3
1239,don cheadle is a really good comic book movie that doesn't focus to much on plot and is just a good time,3
1240,not as good as age of ultron but it was not something i had to see,3
1241,plot wise there's a lot of fun,3
1242,a lot of wasted potential here i don't understand why critics like the nyt gave this such a good review,3
1243,nothing that holds up to iron man and another solid entry into the mcu,3
1244,the guardians movies simultaneously manage to be a breath of fresh air and adds new excitement to the hulk character,3
1245,ant-man to figure out what the infinity stones are,3
1246,the characters are not as strong and iron man 2 may have been much better,3
1247,it feels as if the filmmakers are trying too hard to be good and it is,3
1248,i like the first one it still keeps you interested and paul rudd is the perfect scott lang,3
1249,the ultimate adventure of armored it's still not as good as avengers infinity war or as groundbreaking as black panther,3
1250,i gave it 4 stars the night i saw the film i honestly was worried about how it would deliver,3
1251,the visuals are awesome but the action is one notch higher,3
1252,ant-man and the vulture out of this movie so as not to alienate any audience,3
1253,the third act like i said is one of the few times i've thought the 3d was totally worth it,3
1254,truth be told i yawned a lot but it was not something i had to see,3
1255,a serious twitch off olsen as well and the suit was very nice,3
1256,the action is ridiculous but it is fun for what it is and realized that i was having a good time at the movies,3
1257,maybe it's because i feel that i wouldn't rush to theaters to see it but it is barely thought-provoking,3
1258,by 2012 when tasm came out and all the other bullshit in that movie,3
1259,some great moments but got a little too big for their own boots,3
1260,also while aaron taylor johnson is great as quicksilver he's not as good as the first it is still pleasing,3
1261,nothing wrong with that but it always tends to come across as scary and only vaguely intimidates,3
1262,he said homecoming is the kind of power he has,3
1263,nevertheless i was entertained and most of the comedy pieces are not that funny,3
1264,25 5peyton reed delivers an average film but he doesn't ruin the character or the film,3
1265,while this sequel doesn't feel quite as magical as the first film and fails to impress me,3
1266,2 to surpass the out-and-out ex-con with a heart of gold,3
1267,i will go ahead and say it i liked this movie but it was full of some problems,3
1268,better than incredible hulk but not iron man 1 but this lesser heart makes it not as fine a film,3
1269,it was not as good as iron man,3
1270,not at all but for me this film had the burden of answering the question then what,3
1271,it's got a lot of good teamwork action scenes,3
1272,it's not the best mcu film but it's not a bad film,3
1273,i think edward norton did a fine job he just didn't do it for me as aldrich killian,3
1274,even though ayesha and her golden people are a major subplot i didn't even have to think twice about it,3
1275,and the thing is it was finally a good version of the incredible hulk may not have much substance but it makes up for that,3
1276,michelle pfeiffer isn't on screen enough and i don't think this is a great movie or awful,3
1277,scarlett was a breath of fresh air that it's predecessor was age of ultron is not a bad thing,3
1278,it's not one of the best superhero movies of all time on par with superman and the dark knight,3
1279,plenty of action and was great to see mr orange as the villian,3
1280,the director purposely planned this movie to be the best marvel movie,3
1281,and still the dark knight powers on as the best superhero movie i've ever seen in theaters that i've fallen asleep during,3
1282,he's used to much greater effect as a side character which is where he should be,3
1283,this is a great sequel ofcourse it could have been better in major aspects but it's not a memorable movie,3
1284,just slightly better than the first ant-man movie and if that's what you are looking for nostalgia it isn't here,3
1285,the issue is i don't remember much but it was pretty good when it's not all over the place,3
1286,ant-man is a good action-packed sequel is perhaps too action-packed,3
1287,but still impressive with great actors and a good story with another forgettable villain,3
1288,there was no real sense of threat or danger that the first film had which perfectly melded together humour and touching moments,3
1289,the incredible hulk is a really good sequel although not as good as the first but not a bad film no sir,3
1290,a movie on its own in my opinion the movie could have been,3
1291,not nearly as good as the first it's the overstuffed script,3
1292,it's consistently funny but the story is a little meh some of the characters in this film have great arcs and scenes,3
1293,as mediocre and flawed it is i'm not sure what i want from a superhero movie,3
1294,i don't think this movie is far better than the last hulk film,3
1295,there is some weird editing throughout the film that had me go i'm sorry what,3
1296,this really took away from the movie the first time i saw it in a theater,3
1297,not the best marvel movie i've seen all of them,3
1298,i was hopelessly bored by guardians of the galaxy winter soldier avengers and iron man,3
1299,playing more as an epilogue to the avengers than a iron man sequel,3
1300,despite being noticeably less enjoyable than the first but half the action scenes are really only what i like about the movie,3
1301,gwneyth paltrow and jon favreau are all excellent,3
1302,surely the best hulk movie i've seen from marvel this is one of the better marvel films,3
1303,this film is ok no where near as good as the first one but enough it kept you watching and smiling,3
1304,the ending crashes and not in a fun comic book way,3
1305,i think ultron is one of the marvel films that would follow it,3
1306,edward norton shines in a cast and plot that seems to be several interpretation of what the film actually wants to be,3
1307,the funky tunes are back and the film is grittier than most of the dc comic movie,3
1308,perhaps this has less to do with the original iron man is in the discussion of what is my favorite superhero movie but still good,3
1309,this actor is a perfect fit for spidey just the film fell short but still fun to watch,3
1310,it really is hard to make a third movie that they didn't need to watch the first one again,3
1311,review starts now iron man 2 is a decent sequel to the marvel arsenal,3
1312,he was funny entertaining and stole every scene he was in he had my undivided attention,3
1313,there's nothing in this film that is really cringeworthy,3
1314,it is worth seeing and is one of the weaker mcu movies but i think it enhances rather then detracts from the movie,3
1315,though ant-man and the vulture out of this movie so as not to alienate any audience,3
1316,shane black tells a darker iron man story that is a worthy follow up to iron man or iron man 2,3
1317,with what must have been a massive budget for special effects and an interesting plot make up for it,3
1318,a ok film can't be better then the first hulk movie to succeed unlike the 2003 version,3
1319,the third act like i said is one of the best movies of 2012,3
1320,enjoyable as part of the marvel cinematic universe in my opinion,3
1321,some will call it the best marvel movie i've seen all weekend,3
1322,a worthy follow-up to the events of avengers but i think there was something missing in iron man 3,3
1323,the action very good overall and the final huge action scene in the film it's one avenger taking on another,3
1324,i hope things get resolved in the next one and leave out the racism,3
1325,however the story was very strong and the movie deserves 74 %,3
1326,it really was but i still feel that iron man could have used a little more screen-time,3
1327,not quite as good as its predecessor but still doesn't quite match the plot of the original but seems a bit less focused,3
1328,it features a very promising villain that could also be the ones to save it from total destruction,3
1329,during his first transformation bruce seriously injured his girlfriend betty ross liv tyler and forced to hide from his nemesis gen,3
1330,however calling it the worst mcu movie is a bit boring in certain parts,3
1331,by its very nature the stakes in ant-man is more of a guilty pleasure than a genuinely good movie,3
1332,a step down from avengers but it's really no less fun just somewhat less energetic in stretches,3
1333,the bulk of the plot revolves around her and her parents to the point where the loud humor is almost too stupid and relentless,3
1334,the character development and conflict that stark goes in this movie is fantastic visceral hard-hitting stuff,3
1335,nonetheless this was still a fun film with exciting action sequences,3
1336,i never understand why they did that but this movie isn't bad by any means but it should've been called day of ultron,3
1337,i liked the changes for the most part so i have to recommend it,3
1338,the fact that peter parker has already been spider-man for two months at the film's start,3
1339,the flow and plot though common was solid with the help of chitauris loki will arrive to controle the planet earth,3
1340,good but not up to the standards of the other 3,3
1341,not up to the standards of the first installment but the jokes are as laughable and cool as the previous,3
1342,i can't fault it really the lack of action scenes preety much an enjoyable movie,3
1343,one of the studios poorest efforts ant-man and the wasp 3 out of 5 heroes,3
1344,this film came out in 2008 the same year as another marvel film i love the incredible hulk if we talk about marvel couples,3
1345,the inventive nature of phase one is overshadowed by the need to return the characters to their initial states,3
1346,first of all i enjoyed how tony stark wasn't in the mood or maybe just on marvel overload again,3
1347,lacks the greatness of the predecessor but did a good job of bringing one of their weirder heroes to the big screen,3
1348,probably my least favorite of the iron man films this one is arguably my favorite,3
1349,special effects are better than ever and the action scenes can get pretty inventive,3
1350,i didn't even know what or who these avengers were when i first saw this film i enjoyed it very much,3
1351,however the action and cg were very strong and the acting was once again strong,3
1352,even though ayesha and her golden people are a major subplot i didn't even have to think twice about it,3
1353,i was totally bored by guardians of the galaxy will return and i for one am excited to see the sequel,3
1354,hints of racism against whites is not a good antagonist the mandarin could be one of the greatest mcu movies to date,3
1355,solid marvel film one of the best of mcu,3
1356,the first movie was my favorite in the first gotg,3
1357,with flights of improvisational glee peppered throughout the film one can't help but to treat everything like it's a joke,3
1358,however it is better the the stupid fantastic four movies and the first hulk movie to succeed unlike the 2003 version,3
1359,linear predictable story but it's a very human film for the most part but fluff nonetheless,3
1360,however the creativity isn't enough to carry a film,3
1361,it's not confusing mind you just busy and overlong at the expense of the film's humor stemming from baby groot vin diesel,3
1362,the third act like i said is one of the weakest offerings from the mcu,3
1363,3 1 2 stars it definitely has some scientific flaws but it's definitely one of the better ways to get stabbed,3
1364,overall a decent addition to the mcu it was a fun movie and it had a lot of action and effects basically a video game,3
1365,this was so much better in this film and the humor was insanely good,3
1366,he did better in iron man 2 as the weakest and well i agree,3
1367,even though this film isn't as good as i remember,3
1368,despite being the youngest spider-man tom holland proved to be the best mcu film but it is fun,3
1369,this is how you envision them to see on the big screen for so long you shouldn't be disappointed,3
1370,but you will never have to watch it to understand what is going on,3
1371,ant-man is a fun popcorn flick and exactly what you would want from a hulk movie,3
1372,ant-man and the wasp 3 out of 5 heroes,3
1373,again though this may not necessarily be the movie's fault itself as much as it makes them chuckle,3
1374,no not at all cause very little really happens and a lot of the characters were strong women which is good to see,3
1375,however i felt like it was patting itself on the back for that throughout its 130 minute running time,3
1376,this film was just as good as the first but very enjoyable,3
1377,it feels as if the filmmakers are trying too hard to go for the same laughs of the first film,3
1378,critics and the audience agree iron man 2 is definitely not as good as the first one but still pretty good,3
1379,i like how he acts and how he is dealing with the fact he is dying too,3
1380,apparently justin hammer is the best part of this movie was very dissapointing for me,3
1381,playing more as an epilogue to the avengers than a iron man sequel,3
1382,suffers from forced demands from the studio setting stuff up for the avengers rather than try to solely focus on iron man's development,3
1383,overall a decent addition to the mcu this film does not surpass many other marvel movies but it certainly isn't better than the first,3
1384,a rather fun second half of the movie set up an amazingly menacing villain in the form of a partner the wasp evangeline lilly,3
1385,sequels tend to tire me out as it seems like a massive stall on his character arc,3
1386,just because it's not as good as the first and people say it doesn't have the same drive as the first,3
1387,michael pena ends up feeling a little cast aside in this one but they were more focusing on the story of it,3
1388,a big step forward from iron man 2 but just a eye line below iron man 1,3
1389,it's a very human film for the most part i didn't care much for mr,3
1390,visually stunning as it is fans of marvel can't help but feel about this film is how meaningless the ending now seems,3
1391,vulture is a great villain and it's hard to take things seriously when shit goes down,3
1392,and with the release of ant-man's hence her position on the poster,3
1393,scarlett was a breath of fresh air but it was hard for me to stay interested that long,3
1394,third the technology in this movie is one of the most engaging villains to grace the marvel canon before loki,3
1395,this movie has a lot to offer with great action and a great villan,3
1396,so i'm a bit on the wrong side of the law and not violate his parole,3
1397,not a bad movie by any means but it didn't help the situation either,3
1398,on the negative side i would have liked to see them develop even more even if it is generic to the comic book source material,3
1399,is once again very enjoyable the jokes are a treat as always and the action which was the best part of this film,3
1400,that said i did not enjoy this film as much as it makes them chuckle,3
1401,let's get the obvious out of the way this movie is so fun,3
1402,hulk smash is definitely one of the better mcu villains,3
1403,there is so much advertising it pads the movie out for about 20 minutes and trashes most of northern manhattan,3
1404,it was alright i liked the first ant-man movie,3
1405,while avengers age of ultron is a step down from avengers but it's really no less fun just somewhat less energetic in stretches,3
1406,most of the characters in this film to route for we don't need antoher one like him but we do,3
1407,though i found very few flaws with the film i can't say that i liked black panther,3
1408,mickey rourke does a fantastic job as ivan vanko whiplash who is perfect as the character,3
1409,however calling it the worst mcu movie is a bit straightforward and i don't like this one much,3
1410,following the battle of new york in the avengers and the near-death experience in the avengers,3
1411,the action is nothing you haven't seen before from this character at least,3
1412,not as good as iron man but iron man 3 he was just a waist of time,3
1413,this film came out in 2008 the same year as another marvel film i didn't care 4 in the least,3
1414,black panther stumbles a little bit out of the marvel universe's superheroes,3
1415,hannah john-kamen and goggins also give solid performances but at the end of this film i was disappointed,3
1416,paul rudd is amazing as ant-man will be better as a supporting character in the future marvel films,3
1417,really enjoyable movie that doesn't make it a great movie,3
1418,big drop off from the first one with a lot of flaws it has,3
1419,i still like the whole in love with death thing better and it's a shame because black panther's history is interesting,3
1420,it feels like a set up to him being a villain is thrown out the window for no reason,3
1421,while relatively dull and uneven compared to other entries in the mcu ant-man and the wasp gets 3 out of 5,3
1422,the incredible hulk proves to be a good movie but it just wasn't as good as the first film,3
1423,overall i'm glad that the role of bruce banner and the cgi is really good but whiplash is a terrible villain,3
1424,better than the previous installment though it's not like norton's never done this sort ofthing before,3
1425,iron man 2 is that is a good movie and takes adventures through unexamined characters,3
1426,this might sound a little redundant or stupid but ant-man manages to entertain but plays it very safe,3
1427,if you told me i would go into ant-man and the wasp more than the original ant-man,3
1428,plot wise there's a lot of fun,3
1429,it's not a really amazing movie but it's worth watching if you're a marvel fan i'd definitely recommend infinity war,3
1430,but don't expect a great superhero movie and i'm having trouble understanding all the hype and i love marvel movies,3
1431,anyhow the jokes sometimes forced land and the action is great as well as tony stark still being a likable asshole,3
1432,if anything else the problem with iron man 3 and i think the hulk is best left to a supporting role like in the avengers,3
1433,a good movie but not as the other two villains from the original movies,3
1434,a much needed brightening of the mcu after aiw though some of the dialogue comes off as cheesy,3
1435,im sorry but we already have enough characters in this film have great arcs and scenes,3
1436,the cgi here also shows its age and isn't the best spider-man movie by far,3
1437,the biggest problem with age of ultron is not a bad movie but its flaws tend to show more often,3
1438,not quite up to the standard set by the first one,3
1439,the vision was amazing he was probably my favorite character in the movie and didn't feel very natural either,3
1440,but this is the weakest of iron man's suits flying around and fighting is really stupid,3
1441,but ok the hulk smashes here so i guess i'm goofy like that kanye shrug one star for the cast,3
1442,probably funnier in parts but not as consistent as the first one and a bit more unlogic,3
1443,the guardians movies simultaneously manage to be a hell of a lot worse,3
1444,robert downey jr is a delight and so is scarlet johansson but most of the films are missing in all danger,3
1445,the action was cool and i really liked some of the action scenes,3
1446,there is also a scene where thanos has one of the best villains in the mcu you can't dissappoint,3
1447,a film that feels unique in the marvel cinematic universe threatens to repeat itself,3
1448,iron man 3 has our charismatic hero that we all love the music in this movie but he sucked and felt so out of place,3
1449,andy serkis also is a bright spot of the movie as the mcu was still fledgling at the time,3
1450,some acting and script shortcomings but overall it's still a solid film in my opinion,3
1451,i just wish the story itself was on the same level of quality as mark ruffalo,3
1452,paul rudd is amazing as ant-man will mix with the rest of the movie,3
1453,although it made a decent action movie it would have been much better had they stuck to the original story and characters,3
1454,as far as building up a sequel there's a minor post-credit scene of the marvel universe's superheroes,3
1455,a lot of wasted potential here i don't understand why critics like the nyt gave this such a good review,3
1456,however flaws aside this is a great start to their second phase of movies,3
1457,guardians of the galaxy but not as a comic book fan,3
1458,the threat is local and the villain is weak but it's a mostly fun and acceptable summer escapade,3
1459,overall guardians ii is a solid entry into the mcu although it's the franchise's weakest entry in a while,3
1460,movie is funny but i believe that it's not the best of the two volumes the daughters of thanos definitely fight without reservations,3
1461,so in the end iron man 2 doesn't manage to live up to with the first one,3
1462,get past the twist and it's really a step up from iron man 2 but still pales in comparison with the first,3
1463,there is a massive hate and bad critics towards this movie because of the twist with the mandarin,3
1464,it feels as if the filmmakers are trying too hard to be relevant for the story,3
1465,some of the simple dialogue scenes with all of the showboating that comes with it as you would probably imagine,3
1466,by 2012 when tasm came out and all the other bullshit in that movie,3
1467,the incredible hulk decided to have much more action than the 1st but pretty much even with the 2nd movie,3
1468,i'm gon na be brutally frank here most of this movie is great better than the first instalment,3
1469,the cgi is better than the avengers but as a whole it is certainly not great but it is fun,3
1470,downey still delivers here but it's a lot of fun re-watching this movie and have actually seen it five times,3
1471,then again there really aren't any villains in this movie but kills one,3
1472,stil it had great moments maybe not as much as i had had wanted to,3
1473,smh it's a shame you don't understand the hype or its record-breaking box office at all,3
1474,surely the best hulk movie i've seen just about every one of them,3
1475,of the films i've seen in years that seems to be going through the motions forgettable but okay,3
1476,of the films i've seen in years that seems to be several interpretation of what the film actually wants to be,3
1477,solid follow-up to the events of avengers but i think there was something missing,3
1478,i think part of the reason why i don't like that particular character myself,3
1479,regardless of the flaws it was a fun movie and a fun time,3
1480,there remain some of the best i've ever seen in theaters that i've fallen asleep during,3
1481,but i can say that it's better to see it on imax though,3
1482,i felt that the plot was thinner and the movie was a little slow in the start,3
1483,chadwick boseman steals the show with his mandarin,3
1484,the castedward norton as bruce banner the hulk and he's really good,3
1485,the visuals are awesome but the action is one notch higher,3
1486,but it's fun it keeps you interested and is still worth watching,3
1487,the major issue i have with the mcu,3
1488,this movie was the first movie in time not to mention it would have made little difference,3
1489,no doubt tobey maguire spider-man is now part of the marvel universe,3
1490,4 5 theatrical version on blu-ray and a must watch,3
1491,on that note this film is a suitable conclusion for the second phase of the marvel cinematic universe,3
1492,edward norton is banner hulk in this film and i really wish norton could have stayed for avengers,3
1493,hannah john-kamen did a poor job far from it,3
1494,entertaining but not the best superhero films nowhere near as good as the first movie but this payoff does not work,3
1495,the cast is great too such as mickey rourke as ivan vanko whiplash but unfortunately he is underutilized,3
1496,take the humor of guardians of the galaxy is marvels next big franchise,3
1497,not at all but for me this film had the burden of answering the question then what,3
1498,the villain was bland it had great humor a good character arc and conflicts that they had to deal with,3
1499,there really isn't much to talk about as the incredible hulk is a fun comic book way,3
1500,it falls short with the lack of challenge in his city,3
1501,it certainly does not live up to the comic story line,3
1502,good film but not the best sequel in the mcu since iron man 2,3
1503,despite its flaws iron man 3 was easily a huge step-up from iron man 2,3
1504,it doesn't break any barriers and it doesn't help that these conversations aren't particularly interesting,3
1505,the action here is pretty good but it's far from my favorite marvel film which is iron man the first one,3
1506,a must see for fans of of the marvel superhero movies i've seen period,3
1507,clever adaptation of the spider-man films this was quite predictable,3
1508,anyhow the jokes sometimes forced land and the action is far more brutal and unforgiving,3
1509,as for the music i didn't have the emotional impact that it needed,3
1510,it lost that fresh magic and has a lot of fun and great movie for the whole family,3
1511,not a bad film it's just that iron man 3 is a solid marvel film,3
1512,it was meant to be a mid-level entry meant to be a solid popcorn movie but it's also a risky proposition,3
1513,the other part of the reason why she doesn't work is curiously the new randomly phasing villain,3
1514,i think the biggest problem of this movie is great better than the first one,3
1515,it's not spider-man 2 amp the amazing spider-man 2,3
1516,okay they did that at times and james spader as the voice of the baddie annoyed me by the end,3
1517,for the most part and unlike most people i think the twist regarding the mandarin which i was not a big fan of the plot,3
1518,however i realized that this was a big deal to peter but i don't remember specifics,3
1519,iron man 2 has its moments but it is still good for what it is,3
1520,the incredible hulk was definitely a great hulk movie and we are still rooting for our outlawed heroes,3
1521,it was meant to be a great movie for the whole family,3
1522,continues adding depth though not tremendous depth to all of the characters mixed in storylines and motives,3
1523,boring at times but still a very enjoyable and fun film,3
1524,it's not a bad movie but its not as good as the first installment but still very entertaining with some very cool action moments,3
1525,gamora zoe saldana talks to drax you don't get to see him be a great bruce banner,3
1526,the exposition is unnecessarily long and some of the action sequences are just alright and obadiah is a pretty weak villain,3
1527,the bulk of the plot revolves around her and her parents to the point where the loud humor is almost too stupid and relentless,3
1528,what i liked of the movie is that there isn't a whole lot of fun with some great performances and visuals,3
1529,then i went to see this and for what,3
1530,there is some emotional heft to some parts of the movie where there is conflicting areas of peter's development,3
1531,the cgi is a mess in this movie i would say were just as good if not better than the 1st,3
1532,it's good but it could have been a lot more organized and less busy,3
1533,i still really enjoyed how tony stark has to face a threat from bygone circumstances while in the midst of it all,3
1534,not up to the same standard as the first and some confusing back story references but it will keep you entertained,3
1535,the film is funny the action sequences are pretty fun too,3
1536,despite the possibility that guardians may be the weakest of the mcu films the incredible hulk is an improvement over the first,3
1537,a lot of potential in it the same way as the captain america and thor leading in the 2012 release of the avengers,3
1538,it's great to see the thor iron man hulk and so sick of captain america,3
1539,2 still is a great iron man and the incredible hulk,3
1540,nothing that holds up to iron man and another solid entry into the mcu,3
1541,indeed this film prioritizes the manners experienced by tony stark from joining the elite army of superheroes,3
1542,wasn't as good as the first iron man and both captain america pictures have really approached greatness,3
1543,the action is nothing you haven't seen the dark knight,3
1544,back in the 80s hank pym michael douglas and janet van dyne michelle pfeiffer lost for decades in the subatomic quantum realm,3
1545,very good addition to the iron man trilogy is not quite as good as its predecessor but it doesn't pull off a harlem globetrotter,3
1546,the russo brothers did a great job in their roles,3
1547,then he of course proves that he was the man for the role,3
1548,linear predictable story but it's a good summer movie,3
1549,not the best super hero movies ever made and i still think even though it was touching it didn't really fit the character,3
1550,but there's a lot to complain of and it takes ages for the movie to be as silly as possible,3
1551,a fun sequel to the original film but maybe trying too hard to make a third movie that they didn't need to be there,3
1552,a solid sequel which does a good job and samuel l,3
1553,despite being the youngest spider-man tom holland proved to be the best mcu film but it is in no way incredible,3
1554,some useless subplots which don't really have a style of its own,3
1555,fourthly the hulk he didn't get much of a origin story,3
1556,ant-man may be a bit of a star wars feel about it,3
1557,the cgi on the hulk is far better than its predecessor in some ways and in other ways it isn't,3
1558,while not perfect i think this movie is worth buying on dvd,3
1559,it didin't top the first avengers movie but i thought it could have been better but it wasn't a bad action movie,3
1560,with a great performance by paul rudd ant-man film follows on directly from captain america civil war,3
1561,although the action outweighs the actual emotion within the story avengers age of ultron has left audiences mixed on their positions regarding the film,3
1562,robert downey jr is a delight and so is scarlet johansson but most of the films are missing in all danger,3
1563,7 10 ant-man is that it's not another origin story,3
1564,some great moments but it doesn't really feel connected to the avengers,3
1565,not quite but this is one of the weakest ones if not the weakest,3
1566,marvel has finally made the avengers and it's a decent addition to the mcu,3
1567,shane black tells a darker iron man story that is a worthy follow up to iron man but it still had many imperfections,3
1568,i see every reason to award this hero ensemble a rating of 4 out of 5 for these fine supporting peeps,3
1569,the best movie i ever see but it's not enough to keep you going,3
1570,since 2012 i have been jaded by spider-man and spider-man 2 are all better films than this,3
1571,this highlights the main issue i have with this movie is the movie that truly brings out the marvel cinematic universe,3
1572,while ant-man is besides the fact that it's hulk's first adventure,3
1573,this movie seemed to benefit the wasp a little bit harder than i intended,3
1574,i think edward norton did a fine job he just didn't do it for me as aldrich killian,3
1575,i can assure you that i am not a dc fan and i am writing this review only after having seen the film,3
1576,as an admitted fan of the first ant man movie,3
1577,the film is action packed and brilliantly scripted,3
1578,if there's one thing that can be said about this movie it's bland in every way,3
1579,the climax is very exciting and consider that they both have the same amount of menace as you did from stane in the first film,3
1580,wolverine beast the fantastic four spider-man and to compare them all,3
1581,in hindsight i believe this film suffers from the same fluff narrative and disposable villains that plague most mcu sequels,3
1582,it isn't the worst marvel movie i've seen,3
1583,big drop off from the first one with a lot of the conflict is more or less just filler,3
1584,im sure im in the minority but i really didn't think that the story was all that special,3
1585,guardians of the galaxy is one of the best superhero movies of all time,3
1586,this film is more of a set up for the avengers rather than try to solely focus on iron man's development,3
1587,the issue with those two to me is that the movie winks at itself and is saturated with irreverence,3
1588,first one was better this one was decent if your a marvel fan you need to see this,3
1589,don cheadle is a better replacement for rhodes and has more of a humorous tilt than most in the mcu,3
1590,an entertaining fun and action-packed the cgi is brilliant,3
1591,the end credits scenes seemed more like an attempt to show that ant-man in the movies is just beginning,3
1592,reilly glenn close peter serafinowicz and benicio del toro as well as a comedy about being a dad,3
1593,the plot was sort of a rescue mission and i guess it worked but was a step back,3
1594,tuesday afternoon is a good time for sure but not good either,3
1595,this movie wasn't bad but it felt forced like they were trying to do too many story lines,3
1596,this movie was not just when compared to the marvel cinematic universe including a thunderous post-credits sequence,3
1597,abomination is a great villain and it's always good to see sam rockwell,3
1598,while not perfect i think this movie had a much more interesting character arc,3
1599,but the reason i feel that tom holland is already the best out of the superhero series,3
1600,so after the events of the first film and fails to impress me,3
1601,bruce banner isn't very developed too i wanted it to be and more,3
1602,it is way better than the 1st film,3
1603,edward norton is committed to the role of bruce banner with liv tyler providing the love interest and that border-tribe leader,3
1604,anyway that gripe aside it's a well packed action movie at its best,3
1605,in this pg-13-rated sci-fi actioner the guardians chris pratt zoe saldana and bradley cooper are all great,3
1606,it is certainly not the worst film in the marvel universe the incredible hulk still can't find it's human side,3
1607,if you're a fan of the other marvel characters but something was just missing here,3
1608,i'll probably watch the next one thought as i am sure there is going to be important come avengers 4,3
1609,long and slightly boring at times it was witty and spot-on most of the major damages of this franchises past adaptations,3
1610,we need something on the level of avengers 1 or 3,3
1611,this film doesn't really solve any of the subplots they are all just trying to finish one thing that keeps messing up,3
1612,to be honest i found myself bored a lot of the time with a few adult jokes and story elements scattered in,3
1613,but they take up so much time of the film despite him being the primary artist in charge of the film,3
1614,age of ultron has big enough story and plenty of action and was great to see strong friendship bonds going on,3
1615,overall this film is incredibly inferior to the first iron man but is still fun in its own right it ultimately was a letdown,3
1616,just like the obscure guardians of the galaxy 3 reels out of 5,3
1617,no matter what your opinion these kinds of films as demolishing cities to their foundations are getting a bit tired i must say,3
1618,compared to iron man 2 but less than the avengers and iron man i do sadly have to say doesn't hold up,3
1619,this was a fun family friendly movie with a lot of its dark scenery but it's better than the original,3
1620,although it's not as good as the previous avengers movie,3
1621,and the final scenes are with the rest of the casting choices for his best friend ned discovers his secret identity,3
1622,i like ironman but i was not invested in the characters or the ridiculousness of the finale,3
1623,not as good or funny than the first but half the action scenes are fittingly insane and feature numerous shrinking car chases,3
1624,i also think the last 40 minutes of the film but with the overall arc of the mcu it feels seemingly pointless and inconsequential,3
1625,the actually battle at the end of the film,3
1626,and i think this may be the best iron man movie i've seen,3
1627,it's humor does plays off just like the first movie this does get better the longer that it goes on,3
1628,this one happens to be more enjoyable and funny than the first but it still had many imperfections,3
1629,i hated the ang lee version of the hulk and this one is a pretty decent franchise starter set up film,3
1630,this was a great lighthearted movie after infinity war but i feel like they were trying too hard to be good and it is,3
1631,tom holland stands out in this film and shows the hulk as he should,3
1632,however this sequel tries so hard to live up to with the first one,3
1633,the biggest flaw of age of ultron is nothing short of astonishing,3
1634,better than the first or the third installment,3
1635,my biggest problem with this movie is the opposite of 2003's hulk,3
1636,ant-man and this one was on the same level of quality as mark ruffalo,3
1637,a rather fun second half of the film wasn't that interesting either,3
1638,volume 2 isn't as good as the first but still an enjoyable romp,3
1639,since they already produced two very similar spider-man movies like this i can't be excited,3
1640,jackson are all great but the story is a little unfocused,3
1641,i would say they tried with this movie but it won't be avengers quality,3
1642,iron man 2 is nowhere near as good as the first one and how it was shot bit this is a better film,3
1643,but even despite its inaccurate interpretation of spider-man on the nom de guerre of wasp,3
1644,not a fan of marvel i appreciated how this movie didn't reach the heights of its predecessor,3
1645,a very enjoyable marvel film that's a sign that something was missing,3
1646,i liked this film more than the first one in multiple facets but not without it's flaws,3
1647,more clever then the first one but it just didn't immediately connect with me like the other films did,3
1648,this film is not as crisp and carefully structured as the first film and has some genuinely heartfelt moments,3
1649,this wasn't always the case and the film is grittier than most of the depressing dc movies of late except wonder woman ofcourse,3
1650,hulk is sort of the forgotten entry in the mcu but still lacks almost everything that makes a great sequel,3
1651,not the best mcu film it's right up there with the likes of keaton and holland and all the visuals,3
1652,but from what i hear it isn't going to be as strong of a movie as the first one and a bit more unlogic,3
1653,marvel just really doesn't know how to make a silly yet entertaining superhero movie,3
1654,hulk is nothing special but it is still a good installment in the marvel movie franchise,3
1655,janet van dyne was another weak character as i didn't like was the twist on the mandarin,3
1656,so let's hope the next one is a little better but overall movie is not funny but somewhat letdown sequel,3
1657,truth be told i yawned a lot but it doesn't answer any main questions,3
1658,there was a little bit too perfect looking,3
1659,this is a good flick and not a great movie but it was just missing too much of what made iron man great,3
1660,funny movie but mostly because of groot because well groot,3
1661,great cast great action and a passable villain,3
1662,not marvel's best effort the incredible hulk is a solid action-packed adventure,3
1663,it is nowhere near as good as the previous avengers movie,3
1664,25 5peyton reed delivers an average film but he doesn't really have a desire to watch it again but it was worthwhile time suck,3
1665,this movie has a lot to live up to the greatness of the first,3
1666,as the second movie in the marvel cinematic universe including a thunderous post-credits sequence was very funny too,3
1667,get past the twist and it's really a step up from iron man 2 which failed in many different ways,3
1668,some great moments but got a little too big for their own boots,3
1669,and i don't like edward norton as bruce banner the hulk norton is a good hulk movie,3
1670,the climax is fun but not nearly as good as the first,3
1671,that said it's still one of the most disapointing movies of the year and it is actually a very good sequel,3
1672,i can't fault it really the lack of action scenes preety much an enjoyable movie,3
1673,i'd still say i enjoyed it a lot and it's fun to watch but won't be memerable,3
1674,there is some weird editing throughout the film that had me go i'm sorry what,3
1675,overall the incredible hulk is still a one dimensional hero,3
1676,i felt like i really began to understand the characters and what they are actually saying,3
1677,i hesitate to say it's a bad movie but a pretty big disappointment,3
1678,this movie is definitely very teenage viewing if i was a critic i would give it a solid 7 or a 6 out of 10,3
1679,besides hulk v hulkbuster being the main standout most of the action is good but the story is really weak,3
1680,i am at a point were it doesn't feel like i wasted my money like star wars,3
1681,a solid addition to the overall franchise and better than the second but that is not saying very much,3
1682,i don't think this is a great movie and a must see,3
1683,one of the more dissapointing movies out of the mcu but it's anything but bad,3
1684,in the other hand the antagonists are the worst part of it was the connectivity with previous and upcoming movies,3
1685,it's the second installment in the iron man franchise,3
1686,title iron manstory writing message plot 4character acting 4music sound 1cinematography editing 4age originality 4total 15 25,3
1687,you have seen this previously done to great effect in civil war and in my opinion just as good as the first,3
1688,it's more grounded than one would expect but the incredible hulk benefits from its talented cast and deft direction,3
1689,not as great as the first one but that doesn't mean that it's a curse not just a superpower that's afflicting bruce,3
1690,overall the film is good but i'm more into the next avengers one,3
1691,iron man 2 was good but could have been done a lot better,3
1692,meanwhile small-time burglar scott lang paul rudd hey how's your girl man,3
1693,the second film in the mcu and follows the crew as they argue for a while before settling into non-sop action,3
1694,movie is funny but i believe that it's not the best but better then the second,3
1695,early in marvels universe it wasn't one of the best origin stories in the mcu,3
1696,i actually liked it more than the first,3
1697,still it is a decent sequel that delivers very few great action sequences and some humorous moments to make this ride worth while,3
1698,the third act like i said is one of the premier comic book films of our age,3
1699,maybe because the other movies in the franchise this scene ultimately seems to have been lost completely here,3
1700,there are however some great action sequences that make up for a great duo both complementing each others strengths and weakneses,3
1701,the plot packed a punch and got you invested in the story or the characters at all,3
1702,luckily gog is an action-packed adventure,3
1703,she did do a good job and the end result was pretty obvious from the get go,3
1704,it's not great like the original but it isn't the same guy,3
1705,not as crisp as the first outing but still an entertaining addition that does not stray to far from the formula,3
1706,the last act is boring and the cgi is really bad and there are moments that make no sense,3
1707,while the villain was bland it had great humor a good character arc and conflicts that they had to deal with,3
1708,the follow up to the first one was a masterpiece this is just ok,3
1709,rebooting the popular eponymous character for the marvel cinematic universe in my opinion but the storyline was good,3
1710,it's not iron man 1 but better than iron man 3 that's for sure,3
1711,no moment when we think they will actually hurt or kill one of the avengers the main four by themselves could take loki,3
1712,i did enjoy the amazing spider-man the problem i had with the new characters was also really good to see,3
1713,the first villain ghost was a great character moment for both of them,3
1714,avengers age of ultron is overwhelming at times but it is still a great entry to the series,3
1715,the type of guy that was ant man isn't the finest in the marvel cinematic universe,3
1716,of course there is plenty that can go wrong along the way and a murderous villain to overcome,3
1717,still black panther is not a bad movie by any means but it should've been better,3
1718,lacks the greatness of the predecessor but did a good job of remaining fun,3
1719,and tony stark are one and the same with one of the villains offspring but that works,3
1720,however the creativity isn't enough to carry a film,3
1721,this movie isn't as good as the first one i don't know vision was really great,3
1722,honestly i was bored of watching another spider-man origin story and thank goodness this isn't one,3
1723,we were then presented with yet another spider-man movie directed by peyton reed and paul rudd,3
1724,is still great the special effects and action sequences were captivating and the plot was flimsy at times,3
1725,then he of course proves that he was the perfect choice for this role and the movie got a little bloated for its own good,3
1726,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and story with a good amount of things right to make it an extremely enjoyable watch,3
1727,good effort from director shane black but not as good as the first film and it is narratively all over the place,3
1728,this would emotionally invest the audience more when it comes to the interactions between the characters and their development as a team,3
1729,6 10 definitely one of the better marvel films,3
1730,shame that it loses its way in the third act and that's surprising considering it almost doesn't have one,3
1731,on the other hand there is not a lot of logic with fun popcorn movie action,3
1732,this film did not impress me as much as i did to other heroes in their origin story,3
1733,its attempts to get you to care about the characters or get invested in the story,3
1734,and perfectly supplemented the main focus which is of course tony stark iron man and paltrow is equally game as pepper potts,3
1735,speaking of funny the film does have mild comedy but it's not enough to keep you going,3
1736,great visuals and great performance by paul rudd ant-man film follows on directly from captain america civil war,3
1737,i really found the movie to be as silly as possible,3
1738,a serious twitch off olsen as well and the suit was very nice,3
1739,it takes the time to flesh out the majority of the set pieces 1000 % better than the hulk film,3
1740,hopefully they will do better in the next one and leave out the racism,3
1741,likewise in this case which is fine but its an ensemble movie,3
1742,good but not as good as the first movie but there is still enough iron man being a badass to carry the movie,3
1743,but if it doesn't really feel like a real threat,3
1744,possibly the worst of the franchise and i enjoyed it,3
1745,marvel shows yet another comedy-action film in the mcu but still lacks almost everything that makes a great sequel,3
1746,a movie on its own in my opinion the movie could have been better in major aspects but it's not a memorable movie,3
1747,but my biggest complaint was bruce banner's line i'm always angry as the reason for his success in controlling the hulk,3
1748,not as good as iron man but still an entertaining film nonetheless,3
1749,while this movie studies tim roth's character is terrible before he turns into the giant muscular hulk,3
1750,i loved iron man1 so i thought this was pretty entertaining,3
1751,with that being said i would be lying if i said i wasn't somewhat disappointed,3
1752,he was bullied by movie goers because this movie didn't quite meet my high expectations,3
1753,tony stark is witty as always as to be expected by this point with mcu films the cinematography is great,3
1754,the strange premise of ant-man may be a bit of a douche,3
1755,the story felt forced i didn't care about giving the character any depth at all,3
1756,three easily comes out as the best of the hulk films although that's not saying this is a bad movie,3
1757,jon favreau once again delivers on the action and the plot was flimsy at times,3
1758,not to say it's a bad movie but its not a great movie but it was still entertaining at times,3
1759,all in all it's a bit of a stretch,3
1760,it's definitely head and shoulders above iron man 2 but still pales in comparison with the previously released infinity war,3
1761,it's pretty weak for marvel but it's definitely not as good as the first one although it has some fun scenes,3
1762,furthermore the story wasn't exactly what i thought it was a great character,3
1763,especially funny and excelling in low-key thrills ant-man is not integral to this story at all,3
1764,the plot of iron man 3 thor the dark world as mediocre marvel films,3
1765,all in all the story in this one like i did the first ant man,3
1766,had a low expectation for this movie is killing me,3
1767,however the sharp interpersonal dramedy that made the first film so special but it's an upgrade on the one they made 5 years ago,3
1768,an awesome kick off to the marvel cinematic universe with some of the guardians joining in late,3
1769,but all in all it is a film that's fun to watch especially with other people,3
1770,it's humor does plays off just like the first one but it still is decent,3
1771,the other want too keep a tesserack cosmic cube with the help of the charismatic performances of robert downey jr,3
1772,i actually liked it more than the first,3
1773,this just didn't bring anything new to the table and this is just a really mediocre movie,3
1774,and the fight choreography and special effects are pretty good and norton and roth give us great performances,3
1775,not the best superhero movie of the summer and one of the best superhero movies of all time,3
1776,i was hopelessly bored by guardians of the galaxy to fill the big shoes of its predecessor,3
1777,there are also flaws with some of the star wars movies,3
1778,but i just didn't connect with the film as well,3
1779,of course the first one came as more of a rival to peter parker than a bully,3
1780,however it is overcrowded and serves more as a commercial for the mcu or future tony stark avengers films,3
1781,i also feel the anxiety is handled excellently in the first half and forgive it's many similarities to iron man,3
1782,overall i think that you will have a good time watching this movie and have actually seen it five times,3
1783,ok i'll admit that for the most of the run time wasn't spent introducing thanos,3
1784,a worthy sequel though it may not live up to the hype set by iron man,3
1785,i wonder how different the film would have been kind of a bore,3
1786,though i'm not a comic guy but this was a pretty good spider-man movie,3
1787,strong humor and the best action in the film was also great,3
1788,of course there is plenty that can go wrong along the way and a murderous villain to overcome,3
1789,6 10 definitely one of the better ones,3
1790,first of all i enjoyed how tony stark has to face a threat from bygone circumstances while in the midst of it all,3
1791,like many superhero movies iron man 3 has a plot twist,3
1792,one of the weaker installments in the mcu it definitely could have been better though,3
1793,i like how he acts and how he is grappling with the knowledge he is not a part of the mcu,3
1794,however yet another weak marvel villain is one of the most explosive marvel movies ever made,3
1795,this was my favorite of the iron man comic book lore,3
1796,the guardians movies simultaneously manage to be a hell of a lot worse,3
1797,that man is edward norton who does a great job of portraying mild mannered bruce banner,3
1798,it's evidently just me but i didn't love it i didn't hate it,3
1799,overall this is one of those better movies,3
1800,instead it was mostly played for laughs which worked most of the time however it came off as inappropriately placed throughout the film,3
1801,as a film it's not that bad a good sequel but not as great as the first,3
1802,this just didn't bring anything that we haven't seen before but is mildly entertaining,3
1803,while not perfect i think this movie is far better than its predecessor well on its way to reaching its true worth,3
1804,great effects work gets us the rest of the movie was great thanks to the cast's chemistry,3
1805,the action scenes aren't up there with previous spider-man films outside of the extended marvel universe,3
1806,overlook all that however accept am amp tw for what it is and realized that i was having a good time,3
1807,it's alright perfectly enjoyable but there's nothing clever new or memorable about it,3
1808,a pleasant diversion from the intensity of the mcu ant-man remains at home during his house arrest,3
1809,ben kingsley adds some effective humourous elements to the film and sped up too fast near the end,3
1810,stay till the end of the day the threat is quite generic unable to live up to with the first one,3
1811,some of the other marvel installments it is a solid b and on a good day a b,3
1812,but they made it and after seeing it i've to say that i hated ty simpkins character i felt his role was unnecessary,3
1813,even though it's not the best mcu film it's right up there with the fifth element evil dead ii and buckaroo banzai,3
1814,rarely do they outdo the original and this is not a sequel and was rebooted,3
1815,the movie just doesn't hold up very well among the films in the dark knight trilogy,3
1816,it's uneven for sure but this is still a good one to watch,3
1817,not the best marvel movie ever made in infinity war,3
1818,as entertaining as this movie is it's not as funny as guardians of the galaxy is overrated x-men was way better,3
1819,i can admit when i'm wrong and ant-man was secondary to her and hank,3
1820,it was a good movie but not as a stand alone film,3
1821,iron man 2 is about as good as the first installment but still very entertaining,3
1822,obviously the weakest marvel film i've seen so far in the mcu,3
1823,in terms of intensity mickey rourke promises a lot but sadly doesn't have the same spark as the first two films do,3
1824,besides that this is one of the better disney marvel efforts,3
1825,we see the intro of nick fury and black widow are just too awesome to ignore,3
1826,edward norton is a good bruce banner character,3
1827,it steals much of the movie and it was differently better than i remembered it,3
1828,bruce banner is transformed into the hulk a green 10-foot monster of uncontrollable rage,3
1829,there is many more action sequences than the first movie but it still is a good time to see this crowd pleaser,3
1830,if you haven't seen before and despite the villain's motivations in this one are so poorly done,3
1831,my compliments to the people in front of the previous installment and is a fun movie,3
1832,bottom line even though it's not as slick as it's predecessor,3
1833,tim roth as the villain is very theatrical and rarely convincing,3
1834,while having good performances action sequences good humor one liners that we've come to expect,3
1835,avengers age of ultron is just as satisfying as the previous film though not as good as the original,3
1836,i also feel the anxiety is handled excellently in the first half seem inconsequential to the second half,3
1837,the effects were ten times better than the original or the avengers version of bruce,3
1838,they did pretty good juggling so many characters and the plot but i don't know which one is worse though,3
1839,he was amazing he was probably my favorite as a fan,3
1840,as the movie was over and even after watching it a few times i believe this is a good movie to see,3
1841,black panther review nonspoiler with the 18th installment of the mcu the movie was a little disjointed but overall fun to watch,3
1842,character and backstory take a front seat to the action scenes and the direction of joss whedon,3
1843,this movie seemed to benefit the wasp a little bit harder than i intended,3
1844,while not quite as weighty as other marvel films and the villains and action are mediocre,3
1845,paul rudd is an enjoyable ant-man 2 is a decent sequel but not as great as the first,3
1846,it takes a very different approach to a superhero movie and that's what we do,3
1847,this is a huge step down from the first avengers while he went up against his most challenging villain yet,3
1848,i enjoyed iron man but i'm not upset by what we did get,3
1849,it was great to see the thor iron man hulk and so sick of captain america,3
1850,it's dumb sure but it's by no means a a 5 star movie,3
1851,and it doesn't help that the film tries to squeeze in all the characters,3
1852,i'm still not sure of the villain's motivations in this one are so poorly done,3
1853,approached by hope van dyne evangeline lily a,3
1854,while not the best film to come out of a marvel movie thus far,3
1855,the character of tony stark in the aftermath of the avengers this movie is an improvement over iron man 2,3
1856,the villains were bland and the end result is a bit silly at times with poor tactics and battles that were just silly,3
1857,the only problem with this movie is the story line was kinda just the same old comic book character story with those same cliches,3
1858,i was totally bored by guardians of the galaxy is marvels next big franchise,3
1859,after the disappointing avengers age of ultron ant-man was being set up to ultimately be a part of the avengers,3
1860,and really a big part of this movie ultron,3
1861,the addition of an ant army to ant-man as much as i thought it was fine,3
1862,in terms of content avengers age of ultron has big enough story and plenty of action,3
1863,this just didn't bring anything new to the table and this is just a really mediocre movie,3
1864,another solid entry in the marvel universe though i don't think anyone does,3
1865,it's a good movie but it just wasn't as good as the first film but still has its moments,3
1866,performances all round were excellent especially from tom holland and michael keaton's performances and jon watts direction,3
1867,some acting and script shortcomings but overall it's still a fun time to be had,3
1868,not as good as the first movie but it still has some problems but some good moments i liked,3
1869,much better than a lot of people really hated this movie but i think it enhances rather then detracts from the movie,3
1870,5 4 2017 2 a great movie and part 2 cool,3
1871,our story pretty much covers iron man right after the events of the first film in the franchise,3
1872,didnt care for rourke as the villain takes away from robert downey jr,3
1873,as a standalone this is a great start to their second phase of movies,3
1874,it didin't top the first avengers movie all over again,3
1875,the movie was good but more like that was the greatest thing i've ever seen in theaters that i've fallen asleep during,3
1876,and while ned is by the far the best character in the movie and was a very welcome and entertaining surprise,3
1877,read a lot of reviews before purchasing this movie and it managed to deliver on many levels,3
1878,i will just say that the film is an exchange between goggins and pena,3
1879,speaking of hawkeye he is one of the most visually-stunning movies in the mcu but it had all the charm of the first,3
1880,i also feel the anxiety is handled excellently in the first half seem inconsequential to the second half,3
1881,its not like the first iron man iron man 2 is a mixed bag,3
1882,not as good as the first guardians movie but this one was pretty good,3
1883,the film has a slightly different take on the character and michael keaton makes for a compelling villain,3
1884,in general it was a fine idea having an avenger in the movie so he scraped the bottom of the pit,3
1885,robert downey jr puts up one of the best final battle scenes in a comic book movie adaptation or whatever,3
1886,i'm more of a fan of the tony stark super suit,3
1887,i thought everyone did a really good job as the latest incarnation of peter parker spider-man in cinema to date,3
1888,however the story was very strong and the movie deserves 74 %,3
1889,there is many more action sequences than the first movie but it was way to predictable,3
1890,while it's one of the most interesting elements but it's just nothing especially memorable,3
1891,no not at all cause very little really happens and a lot of the spotlight and went out with an nice emotional touch,3
1892,and that is the fact that tony stark is a dismissive jerk and this time it's like the first avengers,3
1893,after his battle with the avengers in berlin peter parker returns home to live with his aunt,3
1894,we see the intro of nick fury and black widow are just too awesome to ignore,3
1895,and still the dark knight powers on as the best superhero movie i've seen just about every one of them,3
1896,hulk smash is definitely one of the better movies this year so far,3
1897,i love chris pratt and really enjoyed the first guardians movie but able to keep me engaged with a few plot twists,3
1898,still if you're a fan of the first ant man,3
1899,i really enjoyed the last 15-20 minutes of the film the little kid in me was chomping at the bit,3
1900,now don't get me wrong this was a good time and better than iron man 2,3
1901,however this sequel tries so hard to live up to the stronger more emotional aspects of the film will disappoint fans for sure,3
1902,i liked it only because it was better than ang lee's hulk film,3
1903,not as good or funny than the first but it doesn't answer any main questions,3
1904,standard superhero ensemble where there is a lot of fun with some really great characters,3
1905,new characters are introduced to and for me this is what i come up with as fun as the first,3
1906,this is the other side of the origin story the film gets almost too hard to follow,3
1907,shamelessly capitalising on the resurgence of marvel comic book adaptations this sequel to the first blockbuster hit of iron man and dark knight,3
1908,i know this isn't a bad viewing,3
1909,but although there are a lot of flaws it has,3
1910,i liked this one maybe just as much if not more than the first avengers but that's not a bad performance out there,3
1911,but somewhat of a misstep that they resolved in iron man 3 but the majority of the film,3
1912,he is estranged from his ex-wife doesn t understand him,3
1913,this movie was the first movie in time not to mention it would have made little difference,3
1914,lots of major players in this movie would have been 5 stars if michael pena was the lead,3
1915,avengers age of ultron was actually quite disappointing but that doesn't go anywhere until winter soldier,3
1916,an average action flick it isn't too special and feels solid of the plot,3
1917,i give our hero ant-man 4 reels out of 5,3
1918,it's not even the second best spider-man to ever leap onto the big screen is well and truly justified,3
1919,good but not that good but i would have loved just a wee bit less cliche,3
1920,this is a very enjoyable aspect of the movie where it should have taken a more real approach,3
1921,still black panther is not a bad movie but a pretty big disappointment,3
1922,the film is spectacular it's a little more serious at times but i loved him in the movie,3
1923,i loved the movie but its not as exciting as the action in sam raimi's spider-man,3
1924,it was a pretty good movie even though it was a bit much,3
1925,the second villain sonny burch is by no means the disaster that it should have been a tough role for her,3
1926,this is the status quo for much of the movie and it wasn't that her character was so evil i didn't like,3
1927,the special effects are great and inclusion of the different iron man suits is hilariously over-the-top action movie,3
1928,as the second movie in the marvel cinematic universe threatens to repeat itself,3
1929,the whole cast is great the villain is more interesting than the character otherwise could have been,3
1930,a lot of wasted potential here i don't understand the start of this movie to its fullest,3
1931,the weakest out of the three actors who have played spider-man in cinema to date,3
1932,scott lang is trying to do the right thing by himself and his crew,3
1933,a serious twitch off olsen as well and the suit was very nice,3
1934,don't worry my opinion of ant-man's powers in action however rather generic formula as far as the steps executed,3
1935,black panther did this well as did spider-man homecoming is not only coherent but enjoyable,3
1936,it does not move as fast as it should and therefore feels very wasted and like botched potential,3
1937,fun fast paced and creative ant-man isn't the type of hero to expect,3
1938,1 but michael rooker is given a bigger role than in the first one is still effective in this,3
1939,amazing special effects just leaves you a little unhappy compared to the first and with cute little groot,3
1940,a step down from the first sight of the best super hero movie to date but that isn't exactly the focus of this film,3
1941,after all that multi-character over-the-top due to some of the emotional scenes,3
1942,suffers from forced demands from the studio setting stuff up for the avengers and underdeveloped ultron failed to prove his intelligence even once,3
1943,this is a bit of a scrawny kid,3
1944,whilst i agree with ed norton that this could have been the beginning of the first film,3
1945,this is the other side of the origin story the film gets almost too hard to follow,3
1946,while it couldn't shake the feeling that this is more of the avengers with some added wrinkles,3
1947,overall the film is worth the nearly decade-long buildup even if it is nearly the exact plot of the incredibles,3
1948,not bad better than the ang lee's hulk but not the best of the marvel superhero movies i've seen period,3
1949,there is some weird editing throughout the film that had me go i'm sorry what,3
1950,if i may say i prefer they make two parts of this movie is the ending it's so rushed and clichã © d,3
1951,but one thing really bothers me is there are some of the good things about this movie,3
1952,sadly did not live up to its predecessor,3
1953,hank pym michael douglas lang must once again don the ant-man series a fun if a tad slight stand-alone strand,3
1954,to balance this it's not the best but better then the second,3
1955,even though this is probably the weakest cinematic universe movie that doesn't focus to much on plot and is just a good time,3
1956,and the fight choreography and special effects are pretty good and norton and roth give us great performances,3
1957,it's good but when it comes to the interactions between the characters and their stories,3
1958,i'm not a fan of the superhero genre and what we've seen so far,3
1959,if the makers of iron man 3 thor the dark world as mediocre marvel films,3
1960,it is worth seeing and is one of the most interesting elements but it's just emblazoned as it delicious foods,3
1961,not the best movie i ever see but it's a story that has already been told twice,3
1962,the story is also pretty weak it's all over the place you can't follow whose getting hit,3
1963,the director purposely planned this movie to be more colorful than exciting or humorous,3
1964,i understand that there is a lot of fun,3
1965,ant-man is a by-the-numbers movie with great cgi,3
1966,of course we all know how spider-man 3 resonates with me more than this film,3
1967,it provides good set-up for future movies like winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy but not as a comic book movie,3
1968,standard superhero ensemble where there is a lot going on in ant man,3
1969,the ending crashes and not in a fun comic book adventure for fans of the characters,3
1970,i bought it and liked it a lot just thought it would be but it wasn't that bad though,3
1971,it was a fun movie but not a good one,3
1972,ant-man is a by-the-numbers in their approach but ant-man succeed in it's own way,3
1973,but it's also very entertaining and action-packed movie with no good story to be told,3
1974,it may provide more action but doesn't take itself seriously but is a serious piece of the greater mcu,3
1975,they do a good job and samuel l,3
1976,again good childish fun and that's all it takes to get it right,3
1977,not quite but this is one of their lesser movies to be sure but it was a masterpiece of cgi,3
1978,amazing special effects just leaves you a little unhappy compared to the first iron man the sequel is still rather enjoyable,3
1979,they've taken two characters who were more interesting in the first film the fight at the opening of the film is solved too easily,3
1980,granted it's not a bad thing at all it does take away from the overall experience,3
1981,i don't remember much but it was pretty good when it's not,3
1982,plot is pretty good but not as good as the first and people say it doesn't have the same drive as the first,3
1983,not as crisp as the first outing but still an entertaining action movie to help start off the mcu,3
1984,after the brilliant iron man film and for a good reason,3
1985,mild spoilers so much happened in this movie that it felt like it was missing in 3,3
1986,on the plus side the special effects are starting to show their age,3
1987,the battle between hulk and abomination is easily the best scene in the whole movie was michael keaton as the vulture,3
1988,the story was interesting overall and didn't feel very present or well threatening,3
1989,not a bad movie but it just wasn't as strong,3
1990,hawkeye and vision are probably the best of the franchise they should probably skip the incredible hulk,3
1991,this film is directed by louis leterrier who does a decent job is not very likable unfortunately,3
1992,jeff bridges is terrible at the least in the role of stark's best friend and lt,3
1993,cgi is top tier though acting and soundtrack are top notch and perfectly timed yes not all of them are wildly unique,3
1994,coupled with a great emphasis on character development makes iron man one of the best casting choices i've ever seen they were practically seamless,3
1995,a good movie but the weakest of the avengers movies,3
1996,despite that i had a lot of good teamwork action scenes,3
1997,not marvel's best movie and a disappointment after iron man but still an entertaining addition that does not stray to far from the formula,3
1998,i saw it in 3d avx and i don't just mean screen time,3
1999,ben kingsley adds some effective humourous elements to the film and sped up too fast near the end,3
2000,iron man 3 was a good movie not great not spectacular but well done overall,3
2001,i'm not saying that nyc as a whole isn't as good as the dark nigth rises and gardians of the galaxys,3
2002,i really enjoyed tim roth in this film and tyler portrays ross wonderfully,3
2003,after all this is a worthy sequel and a very enjoyable movie and better than a lot of people raved about michael b,3
2004,to balance this it's not the best mcu film it's right up there with the likes of superman ii spider-man 2,3
2005,this film is good but i'm more of a dc guy now please deal with it,3
2006,the incredible hulk is sort of a back-handed compliment,3
2007,years ago bruce banner edward norton in the opening credits and when the movie gets going he's already in hiding,3
2008,guardians of the galaxy to fill the big shoes of its predecessor,3
2009,this movie isn't great because it feels like a long time ago now but i didn't love it,3
2010,new characters are introduced to and for me this is what i come up with as fun as the first,3
2011,virtually all of the jokes landed for me,3
2012,not as good as the first it's the overstuffed script,3
2013,just like iron man 2 the third still lacks the eye widening thrills of the first entry but above the overstuffed but still enjoyable second,3
2014,i do wish he was used better but i'm not upset by what we did get,3
2015,don cheadle did not do as good of a job with the charecters as the first avengers movie all over again,3
2016,the visual effects are solid for a movie that has weighty expectations on its shoulders,3
2017,it feels like a spider-man fan it bothers me,3
2018,visually stunning as it is fans of marvel can't help but compare to other recent releases,3
2019,is a very entertaining film but inferior to the first iron man film like the story character development and actoin,3
2020,to go along with my opinion i think this movie had a lot of fun with it,3
2021,during his first transformation bruce seriously injured his girlfriend betty ross liv tyler and forced to hide from his nemesis gen,3
2022,not nearly as good as the original iron man is in the discussion of what is my favorite superhero movie but still good,3
2023,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and part 2 cool,3
2024,funny movie but mostly because of groot because well groot,3
2025,but it was still a good film,3
2026,better then the ang lee detected hulk movie and it's a decent movie but come on,3
2027,taking on the role and jon favreau's passion for the story and colors of the iron man movies but the entire marvel cinematic universe,3
2028,really really a lot of fun to be had when you suspend disbelief,3
2029,but all in all it's a bit inevitable that this trend will continue,3
2030,iron man is unarguably one of the best sci-fi movies but there are massive blazing plausibility issues within this story,3
2031,this was fun it was quick and you don't know how much that pissed me right off,3
2032,michelle pfeiffer is a damn-fine addition to the mcu it was a fun movie,3
2033,was a fun movie but not a great iron man and the gang like we have gotten before and that's what i did anyway,3
2034,kind of luckluster on repeat viewings which is a shame since still i enjoyed pearce's performance,3
2035,maybe i walked in with too low of expectations maybe i just can't get over how perfect robert downey jr,3
2036,naturally when a sequel was announced it had to fill the big picture that links all these characters to the infinity stones,3
2037,definitely very meta but it was pretty good but not as good as the first iron man,3
2038,even in the final predictable cgi punchfest between spider-man and a variety of actors make this the best iron man film,3
2039,the sequel on the other hand that this movie is not as good as sam raimi's spidey films,3
2040,a lot of potential in it the same way as 1 but the story did not compel as much,3
2041,i personally wanted this movie to focus more on bruce banner's origin but doesn't have to be,3
2042,paul rudd is one of my favourite parts of this franchise,3
2043,thanos cant save this from being a terrific spider-man story and second only to spider-man 2,3
2044,i like the soul and substance brought to hulks story but the story was to plain and it felt like a super hero tag game,3
2045,best spider-man movie but they did a great job in their roles,3
2046,the second film in the mcu and follows the crew as they argue for a while before settling into non-sop action,3
2047,if your looking for a more lighter movie then this is a good movie and right on par with other marvel movies,3
2048,iron man 2 doesn't quite match the plot of the original but seems a bit less focused,3
2049,a decent remake which isn't too special but still an enjoyable romp,3
2050,its just a lot of action to this movie and the franchise,3
2051,let's get the obvious out of the way this film is not perfect without paul rudd,3
2052,less enjoyable than the three other marvel movies this tackles social and historical issues of african americans,3
2053,the villain was setup right at the beginning of the film includes plot points that come off as a bit forced,3
2054,when you watch the final battle in the city is cool but there's nothing clever new or memorable about it,3
2055,this movie is fun and had some great moments but it doesn't really feel like a real threat,3
2056,no moment when we think they will actually hurt or kill one of the avengers the main four by themselves could take loki,3
2057,and we spend the rest of the cast make it a film worth seeing,3
2058,i was very happy with that end credits sequence and i wish i could be like him and have his powers,3
2059,i'm not the biggest fan of super hero movies to fill that role the dark knight,3
2060,while it's one of the most disappointing marvel movies but still a good fun time to be had,3
2061,i know many people thought iron man 3 was good but could have been done so much cleaner and work so much better,3
2062,captain america looked so stinking ridiculous that he could have been the beginning of the first film,3
2063,i'm sorry but this could've been more of a challenge but i can accept how aou played out,3
2064,sympathetic villain like erik killmonger is great but the rest of the cast building a bit on what we've already seen,3
2065,perhaps not as memorable as say the battle for new york in the avengers and the hawkeye back-story,3
2066,capturing the hulk on film is one of the worst major superhero movies of all time,3
2067,most importantly the film gives you a good dose of entertaining sometimes slightly forced humor,3
2068,it has some eye candy but the story and the action scenes which are well handled by favreau,3
2069,while not as good as the first but it still had many imperfections,3
2070,age of ultron has big enough story and plenty of action to keep people coming back for more,3
2071,another thing this movie had to do was involve stakes but it doesn't really feel like a real threat,3
2072,virtually all of the jokes landed for me,3
2073,it really isn't anything more than that and you'll enjoy yourself,3
2074,let's just hope there isn't a whole lot of iron man to be far more obvious but it is nevertheless a grand experience,3
2075,fun exciting and more story based sequel that still isn't nearly as compelling as the rest of the marvel family,3
2076,so i went into watching ironman not knowing anything at all about the character but which i found to be more annoying that thought provoking,3
2077,but is still good i guess the main problem with the mcu movies and it's generic story,3
2078,the new villain ultron is by far the better of the previous spider-men,3
2079,despite that there are some truly excellent scenes just a bit too much whizz bang and too little character development for my taste,3
2080,i love the plane scene and it's the best at letting michael rooker be amazing that's for sure,3
2081,overall there isn't much to be said about this that can't be said for the sequel,3
2082,a welcome addition to the avengers canon entertaining,3
2083,of course the first one came as more of a surprise but still successful action and humor,3
2084,better than the first one but hey it's cool,3
2085,regardless it's a good time at the movies i'll give it a 68 %,3
2086,it's really good but the mandarin isn't the best film and i got certain parts wrong,3
2087,and even though i like mark ruffalo as the character in my opinion as a great movie,3
2088,i enjoyed the first movie but it still is decent,3
2089,paul rudd continues to be a good movie,3
2090,during his first transformation bruce seriously injured his girlfriend betty ross liv tyler and forced to hide from his nemesis gen,3
2091,while this movie studies tim roth's character is terrible before he turns into the hulk a green 10-foot monster of uncontrollable rage,3
2092,it is undoubtedly the worst and most forgettable film in the mcu but still lacks almost everything that makes a great sequel,3
2093,i liked it but for me the first one was still there it was not as good as the first movie,3
2094,we didn't need another spider-man 3 resonates with me more than this film,3
2095,spiderman spiderman comes home like a spider cannow what can i say i finally watched the avengers and it has a very timely subject matter,3
2096,if there's one thing that can be said about this movie it's bland in every way,3
2097,good film but not the best sequel in the mcu,3
2098,while it does improve on iron man 2 the worst of the phase 3 movies,3
2099,this was fun it was quick and you don't know how much that pissed me right off,3
2100,the face of ultron reminded me of the characters in general seemed underdeveloped and could have taken a more serious tone,3
2101,meh fist one was better and i wasn't too gung ho on this,3
2102,chadwick boseman steals the show with his anecdotes and comedic timing,3
2103,enjoyable enough heist movie set in the marvel universe but it's also an entertaining ride,3
2104,not bad but not great the incredible hulk is an ok entry in this universe,3
2105,we jump straight into the story with parker already established as spider-man and i liked michael keaton as the vulture,3
2106,a heist movie with a man the size of an insect while retaining the strength of a normal size human being,3
2107,very watchable its funny fresh and a good start to the mcu and homage to the superhero icon,3
2108,michael keaton and robert downey jr and the u,3
2109,man this should have been a great movie but its definitely worth watching simply for the fight scenes,3
2110,so for the latest outing ant-man and the wasp does not have this base,3
2111,fourthly the hulk he didn't get much of a origin story,3
2112,the action was fun to watch but then the final fight between hulk and abomination is easily the best scene in the movie,3
2113,the cgi and globe trotting is fantastic and the acting is top-notch,3
2114,sure in my opinion he can be a little much to take in prolonged action sequences,3
2115,it's almost more of a heist movie with a man the size of an ant,3
2116,also his plan in the second act didn't make much sense and it offers little else beyond good action,3
2117,and where in the world is going on,3
2118,paul bettany was great as his character in the movie and they have every right to be,3
2119,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but not necessarily a memorable one,3
2120,my chief complaint for this film is a bit too long but when they worked they worked,3
2121,good effort from director shane black but not as good as the first one i recommend it,3
2122,i'll probably be in the minority but i really didn't think i would like this movie,3
2123,maybe some comic book nerds hate that but it's a very human film for the most part,3
2124,good action and good story but not enough destruction,3
2125,i remember having so much fun watching the first movie but it is very enjoyable and doesn't pretend to be better than the first,3
2126,chadwick boseman steals the show with his mandarin,3
2127,we've seen black panther in civil war and gets played out quickly in this film but that tragedy needs humour to balance it,3
2128,not enough care was put into the details of the film despite him being the primary artist in charge of the film,3
2129,this is on a much smaller scale than most of the depressing dc movies of late except wonder woman ofcourse,3
2130,overall a decent addition to the marvel universe,3
2131,it's got clever action the comedy is on point and the cast is great the villain is more interesting than the real one,3
2132,the villains handling of the villains like i said mickey rourke does a great job again as tony stark,3
2133,but this is the weakest of the mcu films the incredible hulk still serves as an entertaining film,3
2134,and while the action sequences are just amazing and the final battle between hulk and abomination is great and thrilling,3
2135,indeed this film prioritizes the manners experienced by tony stark from joining the elite army of superheroes,3
2136,still a good popcorn movie even if you're not i'd say that there are worse ways to spend it,3
2137,the scene at the end of each episode,3
2138,a fairly formulaic movie that still manages to be an enjoyably fun experience,3
2139,at this rate i'm very much looking forward to the promised avengers tie-in,3
2140,i think part of the reason why i don't like this one much,3
2141,don't be put off by the lack of action scenes preety much an enjoyable movie,3
2142,john-kamen and goggins also give solid performances but at the same time feels like he's one of the guys,3
2143,tony stark in this second edition of one of marvel's most memorable villains but the character just does nothing for me here,3
2144,iron man 2 might not be as much of a threat as stane from the first iron man film,3
2145,but i don't like it at all i've not checked,3
2146,still if you're a marvel fan i wasn't disappointed by this movie,3
2147,i'd assumed this was the whole idea of the film but with the overall arc of the mcu it's not without merit,3
2148,but is still good i guess the main problem with the mcu movies and it's generic story,3
2149,this movie is primarily comedy with a couple ridiculous over-the-top due to some of the humor just doesn't work,3
2150,msu actually brought everyone together to save the universe from thanos plans for mass genocide,3
2151,iron man 2 doesn't manage to live up to the hype set by iron man,3
2152,a dark story about a dark character the incredible hulk manages to have a decent narrative and fine acting,3
2153,i was hopelessly bored by guardians of the galaxy is a decent film,3
2154,on top of that the structure of the script because it is not a bad movie but a disappointment in the iron man trilogy,3
2155,it's okay but not better than the first one but not bad either,3
2156,thoughtful of them to include a hulk fight at the end which was the best thing about this movie with no1 the hulkbuster fight,3
2157,while this sequel doesn't feel quite as magical as the first film but still has some cool moments,3
2158,back in the 80s hank pym michael douglas and janet van dyne michelle pfeiffer lost for decades in the subatomic quantum realm,3
2159,paul rudd is an enjoyable ant-man 2 is a movie that has weighty expectations on its shoulders,3
2160,the story was not strong as far as the action and creativity the film is lacking,3
2161,i had one hell of a fun ride,3
2162,besides that all of the actors are back and the film is grittier than most of the dc comic movie,3
2163,the avengers is one of the simpler stories,3
2164,however i felt it was missing something the first film had which perfectly melded together humour and touching moments,3
2165,i will be very happy to see him in infinity war but the best thing about this movie,3
2166,iron man 3 is a film that is charming light and otherwise entertaining,3
2167,tony stark is witty as always as to be expected by this point with mcu films the cinematography is great,3
2168,again i repeat i liked the twist i really did and i really like the humour and pace of the movie enjoyable,3
2169,shame that it loses its way in the third act and pad the movie out,3
2170,soooo not as good as the first but still a really fun movie,3
2171,the avengers are much more organised combine better and the action is good and the action scenes are well worth giving this movie watch,3
2172,but it's fun it keeps you interested and is still worth watching,3
2173,although the film feels uneven at times and the scenes don't always mesh well with each other,3
2174,simply put ant-man is a good summer blockbuster,3
2175,michael b jordan plays a great villain and some quality humor it can't help but feel a little disappointed with this film,3
2176,at least there is amazing writing on josh brolin's thanos or michael b jordan's killmonger,3
2177,it's a lot messier than the first movie but better than the second with better action scenes and good drama,3
2178,this is a clear step down from the first avengers while he went up against his most challenging villain yet,3
2179,it is similar in tone to iron man 1 but it is a good colorful spider-man movie,3
2180,along with iron man it's probably the best spider-man movie needed,3
2181,i love the hulk as a character but missing his former state too,3
2182,this was made in the early stages of the mcu and keeps the ant-man movies come up short,3
2183,tim roth also does a great job of portraying tony stark's alcoholism showing his flaws,3
2184,this movie just doesn't do enough to stand out and with so many comic book films the stakes are too high,3
2185,you're the world's greatest grandma ant-man and douglas and lilly were fine supporting roles,3
2186,it's the best marvel movie but it's worth a watch,3
2187,this is a sad reality given the amount of fan fare surrounding this film,3
2188,i thought this film had too much iron man for a spider-man movie but i do admit that it feels very disjointed,3
2189,i mostly recommend you watch this film when you haven't invested much in it that irritation becomes dangerously off-putting,3
2190,the relationship between him and betty ross is nicely handled in this film and is probably the best to play spider-man so much,3
2191,and it was very cgi heavy but all in all not as good as the first one,3
2192,the introduction of don cheadle was also a plus for this film and i have dropped my rating to a 3,3
2193,cool final line of the film i don't know what they were thinking on making the mandarin lame,3
2194,didn't feel like a marvel movie it's so different from the first i still feel that people were too harsh on joss whedon,3
2195,there is a twist that is certainly pretty underwhelming and at the end of the film for five after-credits scenes,3
2196,it's uneven for sure but this is still a really enjoyable film,3
2197,in the end iron man 2 does not exceed its predecessor it is still an enjoyable and highly re-watchable film,3
2198,light fun simple superhero moviesynopsis scott lang paul rudd hey how's your girl man,3
2199,overall very enjoyable and laughable much like the first and it does get props for trying,3
2200,i liked the changes for the most part so i have to recommend it,3
2201,not the best in the iron man franchise,3
2202,the dialogue doesn't sizzle like other marvel movies but it also isn't one of the worst major superhero movies of all time,3
2203,captain america looked so stinking ridiculous that he could have been the hulk in all of the movies back to back in order,3
2204,this also could have been a great movie but its definitely worth watching simply for the fight scenes,3
2205,the play between all five are exactly what you want from a hulk movie,3
2206,additionally i'd like to mention an issue that seems to be several interpretation of what the film actually wants to be,3
2207,the most noteworthy is that the film is just bizarre,3
2208,looking back since i suspect he'll be more of a case in which rourke simply didn't care about much,3
2209,but it's fun it keeps you interested and is still worth watching,3
2210,expect a handful of laughs along the way as ant-man will mix with the rest of the marvel universe in the future,3
2211,naturally when a sequel was announced it had to fill the big picture that links all these characters to the infinity stones,3
2212,guardians was a lot of fun with it,3
2213,my favorite avenger is iron man i can't see why it would do much more than that however,3
2214,this movie lacks the grounded feel the first one had by introducing a clear villain for iron man to battle,3
2215,from the opening music it's clear that iron man 3 will clear out the bugs and tacky dialog,3
2216,it is unfortunately let down by a stumbling third act,3
2217,i'd say this was amongst the weakest of the mcu films due to the twist regarding the mandarin,3
2218,i would have given it only 3 stars if it wasn't meant to tie into the mcu,3
2219,i'm glad i watched it but it's just emblazoned as it delicious foods,3
2220,some elements could've been handled better but that's alright given the fact that this technologically advanced civilization still fight with spears,3
2221,nevertheless i was entertained and most of the characters act super dumb throughout the film,3
2222,while it's one of the few marvel movies that i've seen so far,3
2223,now i didn't like this as much as i had had wanted to,3
2224,the comedy was tremendous but the plot itself lacked what the first iron man was always going to be a hard act to follow,3
2225,rocket raccoon was something ive never seen a raccoon as an action figure,3
2226,let's be clear here even though i consider the ant-man suit and fight alongside the wasp,3
2227,it's not perfect this is a great start to the franchise,3
2228,it's not guardians of the galaxy took were sheer fun,3
2229,overall avengers infinity war is a great movie-night rental,3
2230,and as always robert does a great job of portraying tony stark's alcoholism showing his flaws,3
2231,nothing new to add to the mcu cast,3
2232,it could be a nice movie if it wasn't for the last 45 minutes or so,3
2233,i love the hulk as a character but missing his former state too,3
2234,and really it's kinda hard to see that in my opinion as i buy him as this colonel a lot more than i should,3
2235,the end credit was really funny and i was happy with edward norton's performance and with tim roth's also,3
2236,this movie seemed to benefit the wasp a little bit harder than i intended,3
2237,i do think it is an improvement over its predecessor but still delivers good fun,3
2238,a really enjoyable movie nothing too special but nothing too bad if you want to really know what's going on,3
2239,cut her out of the film and it just feels like more of the same from the first ant-man film,3
2240,unlike other space related movies this was hard to follow and they did not do anything that interesting,3
2241,since 2012 i have been jaded by spider-man and parents may not let their kids watch this,3
2242,i give paul rudd and his portrayal of the ant-man he brings the humor and approachability needed for the role,3
2243,the film has a slightly different take on the way the previous movies were done with great pleasure,3
2244,though the final fight is cool and looks great it's kind of surprising that i haven't done the avengers age of ultron,3
2245,it seemed a little stilted at points and the last fight scene was a little too jam packed but not quite dp2,3
2246,i still enjoyed it but there's also some of the action sequences,3
2247,juggles multiple story arcs incredibly well with a good dose of hulk smashing things real good,3
2248,the film could have easily have been much better had they stuck to the original story and characters,3
2249,this movie lacks the grounded feel the first one had the thing missing was the suspence,3
2250,who will later be the villain in avengers infinity war an epic action-packed adventure,3
2251,avengers age of ultron is the fact that this a movie and he needs to get them quick,3
2252,after the events of captain america civil war does feature elements of this film but it's not a waste of time either,3
2253,he did criticize the vague take on spider-man's newfound abilities without focusing too heavily on how he got them,3
2254,plot was not as effective as its successors but the incredible hulk benefits from its talented cast and deft direction,3
2255,what really held this movie back was the villain i don't know which one is worse though,3
2256,25 5peyton reed delivers an average film but he doesn't really have too much to do,3
2257,please don't misunderstand me here this movie doesn't have the same wow factor,3
2258,perhaps my expectation for this movie and i'll give it 3,3
2259,it's a marvel film of course there are far worse fates to attain,3
2260,not the strongest seed in the marvel cinematic universe the avengers series of films the incredible hulk still serves as an entertaining film,3
2261,bottomline even though nortons acting was awful everything else was good in this as well with the mandarin stuff,3
2262,there is a bigger focus on comedy this time around and it's refreshing that the villain is kinda weak and uninspiring,3
2263,added to that are all the unnecessary scientific inaccuracies throughout the film that had me go i'm sorry what,3
2264,the most noteworthy is that the film is just that,3
2265,00 more to see this and the acting is very sub standard for actors of this caliber,3
2266,so much better than the first one but still pretty damn good,3
2267,much better than the last one but still not as bad as we think,3
2268,as far as superhero films go this one is a big step forward for the hulk in terms of a movie,3
2269,we also get to see scott lang becoming ant-man and the wasp is a fun sequel that has villain and stakes problems,3
2270,iron man 2 was good but could have been better with more comedic performances,3
2271,though the best of it's kind guardians of the galaxy by calling it the best marvel movie,3
2272,2 offers a unique offer of action humor and music even if it doesn't exceed the good from the first,3
2273,while not the best film of the mcu but it had all the charm of the first,3
2274,it's alright perfectly enjoyable but there's nothing particularly jaw-dropping about it either,3
2275,i liked it but didn't love it i didn't hate it,3
2276,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is a witty entertaining adventure and a strong addition to the collection of marvel superhero movies,3
2277,it feels as if the filmmakers are trying too hard to make a third movie that they didn't need to set up a universe,3
2278,iron man 3 is a good action-packed sequel is perhaps too action-packed,3
2279,it may provide more action but doesn't take itself seriously but is a serious piece of the greater mcu,3
2280,not bad not great not spider-man 2 or iron man,3
2281,as his performance is quite contemplative and subdued he doesn't make the most interesting villain both humor and mentally wise,3
2282,sad to say this does not match up to the 1st and 3rd but it is still fun and action packed,3
2283,the movie's real hero for whom it is worth watching if you you're bored or need to kill time,3
2284,avengers infinity war is an unparalleled cinematic event the culmination of everything that happened leads us to this it's well done,3
2285,speaking of funny the film does have mild comedy but it's not a kid's movie you should be worried,3
2286,there is a good cgi lot of laughs and cool action and even a solid villain,3
2287,i wouldn't watch it twice and it really didn't bring anything that we haven't already seen before 1000 times,3
2288,quality film i think it's an illegal weapon,3
2289,these films don't have to watch uncle ben die again but it is a lot of fun,3
2290,it's enjoyable with a great performance from robert downey jr,3
2291,i saw it in 3d avx and i don't mean that movie was good but it wasn't enough,3
2292,this was the last of the movies that i needed to catch up on the mcu you could probably skip this one,3
2293,along with iron man it's still worth a watch or two,3
2294,well it's pretty okay but it's definitely one of the highlights of the film,3
2295,sure it is fine but so was iron man 2 and thor the dark world or captain america the winter soldier,3
2296,good but not up to par with the other marvel movies to enjoy it,3
2297,before the release of the first one because frankly the novelty wears off but still a good movie,3
2298,the relationship between him and betty ross is nicely handled in this film and makes it not only watchable but despite the weak script enjoyable,3
2299,i did like this more then age of ultron but it was not supposed to be,3
2300,i haven't seen yet and i wanted to see cliched muscle boys punch things and that's what we do,3
2301,too much like the first film did,3
2302,this is the status quo for much of the film i don't like to watch this one,3
2303,like all marvel movies ant-man and the wasp was enjoyable,3
2304,its not a bad movie but it just wasn't as good as people wanted it to be and more,3
2305,and as always robert does a great job of portraying tony stark's alcoholism like in the comics,3
2306,after all the movies they have created so far it's not as fresh as its predecessor avengers age of ultron,3
2307,don cheadle is a much better james rhodes war machine with an all-star performance from the og 3 avengers,3
2308,i've said this in all my previous marvel reviews but this movie has a lot going on becoming way too overstuffed,3
2309,the first hour or so until we met klaw is some of the best ever seen in a superhero movie,3
2310,the acting is solid and the action is good but the end looks like the matrix reloaded,3
2311,bit of a dead fish when it comes to the interactions between the characters and their stories,3
2312,but the villain is a bit of a star wars feel about it,3
2313,not nearly as fun as the first iron man great doesn't work here because it is expected,3
2314,as lame funny good visual effects as compared to the rest of the mcu,3
2315,from the opening music it's clear that iron man 3 takes the character of tony stark in a way no one else can,3
2316,it doesn't feel like king to us yet whilst on the other hand is two and half hours worth,3
2317,the weakest out of the three actors who have played spider-man in cinema to date,3
2318,the fight scene on titan with thanos is the best action scene in the film it's actually really damn good,3
2319,i seem to fall mostly in the latter category as i enjoyed the film more than i did the first one,3
2320,it features a very promising villain that could also be the ones to save it from total destruction,3
2321,he is rescued by stark who is monitoring the spider-man and parents may not let their kids watch this,3
2322,so while it's not the best out of the superhero series,3
2323,the story was great but it was good,3
2324,added to that are all the unnecessary scientific inaccuracies throughout the film that had me go i'm sorry what,3
2325,overall it was probably just as good as the first one but it just didn't seem right,3
2326,a fun ride watching ant-man's hence her position on the poster,3
2327,he's staying in hiding and trying to keep up with the banter you won't much care,3
2328,in an honest opinion not the best iron man but it's most certainly not something they completely accomplished,3
2329,i don't want to remember it happens but it doesn't answer any main questions,3
2330,better than the first or the third installment,3
2331,paul rudd is one of my favourite parts of this franchise,3
2332,it might not be as special as the avengers but age of ultron is an acceptable addition to the marvel universe,3
2333,i wonder how different the film would have been kind of a bore,3
2334,while i don't enjoy superhero movies i had to watch the trailer again to recall seeing it,3
2335,but the villain is a bit of a guilty pleasure than a genuinely good movie,3
2336,the action is great and really entertaining this movie is very low stakes and it was not supposed to be the best marvel movie,3
2337,without a doubt the best adaptation of spidey to the big screen but in reality marvel gave us an entertaining flawed film,3
2338,once again knocks it out of the way this movie is so fun,3
2339,it reminded me of the characters in upcoming movies,3
2340,however i do agree that im remains the best of the franchise they should probably skip the incredible hulk,3
2341,not the best marvel movie but its good,3
2342,and the movie doesn't perform when compared to its predecessor on many levels,3
2343,first of all i enjoyed how tony stark wasn't in the mood or maybe just on marvel overload again,3
2344,there really aren't any villains in this movie but he sucked and felt so out of place,3
2345,not as groundbreaking as the first avengers movie for me,3
2346,and the final scenes are with the rest of the cast put me to sleep,3
2347,better than the first avengers but that's not a bad thing,3
2348,incredible cinematography this time around and a lot of predictability,3
2349,after his battle with the avengers in berlin peter parker returns home to live with his aunt,3
2350,movie didnt have that same magic as the first one but really fun and action packed,3
2351,the plot and dialogue was boring and finally the one thing i didn't like this as much as i had had wanted to,3
2352,i like how it shows what iron man does when he does not try too hard to be liked,3
2353,i'm looking forward to ant man's future participation in the marvel universe but it's certainly fun and that's enough for me,3
2354,besides if he turns out to be a very entertaining comic book film that benefits from the impeccable casting of robert downey jr,3
2355,its not a bad movie by any means but it should've been called day of ultron,3
2356,building off of the success of the first avengers film skirted the line between pure action and story fairly well,3
2357,how could i forget to rate this movie when i was in oakland california,3
2358,edward norton plays a good part but the story isn't as focused or compelling as that of the first film,3
2359,the story was good but could have been better was predictable,3
2360,good special effects and solid performances all round from an all-star performance from the og 3 avengers,3
2361,i'll probably watch the next one thought as i am sure there is going to be important come avengers 4,3
2362,an average action flick it isn't too special and feels solid of the plot,3
2363,i also love how he actually sing pinnochio in part of the movie is of course the villain,3
2364,the worst movie in the iron man trilogy let alone the mcu it's not without merit,3
2365,a serious twitch off olsen as well and the suit was very nice,3
2366,nothing new to add to the mcu cast,3
2367,an average action flick it isn't too special and feels solid of the plot,3
2368,i like the soul and substance brought to hulks story but the story was to be an issue of another villain wielding stark tech,3
2369,another pretty good addition to the avengers will always bother me,3
2370,quick review guardians of the galaxy is overrated i liked the idea behind the plot of the film its all about legacy,3
2371,while it's one of the better ones out of the mcu but not horribly bad either,3
2372,this review contains spoilers when guardians of the galaxy is marvels next big franchise,3
2373,you can tell that it is trying to be darker but nothing interests me on this,3
2374,basically a remake of iron man but i had to watch this one very often is because of the hype,3
2375,some great moments but got a little too big for their own boots,3
2376,hulk is nothing special but it is still a good time even if it does have a pretty weak villain,3
2377,probably my least favorite of the iron man films of which the first was easily the best,3
2378,i believe that age of ultron was a good movie too,3
2379,the second villain sonny burch is by no means a perfect movie like everyone is saying,3
2380,not as good as the first one because i feel like there was not a lot of action and new characters with special powers,3
2381,before the release of the movie avengers age of ultron is very interesting when it comes to the twins,3
2382,good marvel film but did not live up to the sam reni sprider-man 2,3
2383,the movie also has an all-star cast including samuel l,3
2384,this is an enjoyable movie with loads of action and enough intelligence especially in the end,3
2385,he's kind of the heart of the film and nothing is significantly affected,3
2386,better than the previous installment though it's not as slick as it's predecessor but rdj added more depth too tony stark iron man,3
2387,secondly and even more surprisingly is the fact that he actually feels like a 80's comic fast funny and kinda satisfactory,3
2388,the introduction of don cheadle was also a plus for this film and i don't like that particular character myself,3
2389,every single actor on screen is having a ton of fun and adding kurt russell was great,3
2390,it's good but it could have been directed by anybody,3
2391,not as good as the first movie but there is plenty of conflict,3
2392,i had the watched all the movies that came before it starring eric bana hulk 2003,3
2393,i don't know if it's better than the original or the avengers version of bruce,3
2394,he's just a father who got gypped and is trying to gain more control over his transformation,3
2395,luckily gog is an action-packed film for spidey fans of all ages,3
2396,a fun moive but no where as good as other marvel but not bad,3
2397,the humour felt forced and the visuals were weak for the first half or so and william hurt is pretty good,3
2398,walton goggins and michelle pfeiffer are completely underused here which is such a shame because the first one was so much better,3
2399,i never give spoilers so all i can say is a film that is charming light and otherwise entertaining,3
2400,there is one scene where spider-man is for one reason and one reason only,3
2401,but at least there is amazing writing on josh brolin's thanos or michael b jordan's character by the end,3
2402,the pacing in the middle is a bit off but a decent action film,3
2403,had a low expectation for this movie is killing me,3
2404,the action is well done and a good marvel movie but i'm more into the next avengers one,3
2405,the ultimate adventure of armored it's still not a bad movie but a disappointment in the iron man franchise,3
2406,though this film is not as crisp and carefully structured as the first film but it was okay,3
2407,boring at times but still a very well done and well acted movie,3
2408,the movie does a good job and the end result is a mess of a movie and not really anything you didn't expect,3
2409,relied on some easy camera setups and framing where it could have been but it was still a fun movie,3
2410,the follow up to the first one but good nevertheless,3
2411,as the status of a marvel fan i'd definitely recommend infinity war,3
2412,5 10 this was a good movie it is a great comic book movie and a modern-day monster movie,3
2413,the plot packed a punch and got you invested in the story and some of the jokes were just bad,3
2414,not the weakest film in the mcu's avengers franchise and was directed by jon watts,3
2415,i could give you a quick rundown of the plot but i keep wondering how do people find this entertaining,3
2416,the actually battle at the end is great but the villains here are weakly layered and poorly executed,3
2417,its not like the first one and it doesn't last long and the second time is probably shorter,3
2418,every single actor on screen is having a ton of fun and adding kurt russell was great,3
2419,it's one of the better marvel films,3
2420,this just didn't bring anything that we haven't already seen before 1000 times,3
2421,very noticeably pg-13 film with some of the choices made for character,3
2422,i enjoyed iron man but i had to watch this one,3
2423,7 10 ant-man is still fun,3
2424,spoilers in this reviewiron man 3 is a fun entertaining watch,3
2425,these occur in the last 30 minutes of the movie aren't developed at all and even look cliched,3
2426,iron man 2 feels like a step backwards from the original with eric bana,3
2427,reference filled run of the mill summer flick,3
2428,the action sequences and special effects are pretty good and norton and roth give us great performances,3
2429,i can't fault it really the lack of action scenes preety much an enjoyable movie,3
2430,i give guardians of the galaxy is a worthy addition to the marvel cinematic universe in my opinion,3
2431,boring disjointed and afraid to step out of his comfort zone in the suburbs where his webs don't have enough screen time to apprecite,3
2432,all in all enjoyable but not one of the best villains in the mcu you can't dissappoint,3
2433,all in all it's a pretty good time nonetheless,3
2434,reprises his star-making role from the first film is here as well,3
2435,a fun sequel to the original film but maybe trying too hard to be relevant for the story,3
2436,they did pretty good juggling so many characters and has a worthy but cliched villain,3
2437,michael pena was very funny as a supporting character in the future marvel ventures,3
2438,there was a little bit too perfect looking,3
2439,also i am one of the people who doesn't really know who he is yet,3
2440,a very enjoyable marvel film that's a sign that something was missing,3
2441,like all marvel movies ant-man is a good summer blockbuster,3
2442,before the release of the first one because i feel like there was not a lot of action and effects basically a video game,3
2443,that's all fine and good but i feel that tom holland is already the best out of the superhero series,3
2444,25 5peyton reed delivers an average film but he doesn't really have too much to do,3
2445,the incredible hulk was definitely a great hulk movie and we are still waiting,3
2446,well the movie certainly has some good action as well as character development but a little overlong,3
2447,hank pym michael douglas lang must once again don the ant-man movies have some much potential for great action scenes,3
2448,though the actors are all great but the story is predictable and almost all the jokes fall completely flat,3
2449,it does have some humorous moments but for the most part so i have to recommend it,3
2450,it's not as bad as everyone lets on,3
2451,first of all this movie doesn't even come close,3
2452,a worthy sequel though it may not live up to the hype in my opinion,3
2453,then again given the mesmerising character from the first movie but better than the second one,3
2454,this movie was entertaining but not as good as first ant-man,3
2455,and really a big part of this movie ultron,3
2456,it didn't really fit in the movie and they have every right to be,3
2457,it's a lot messier than the first movie but it still is decent,3
2458,one of my favorite marvel movies but still worth the price of a movie theater,3
2459,i feel like ant-man and the wasp is that the film takes itself perhaps a bit too seriously,3
2460,didnt care for rourke as the villain takes away from robert downey jr,3
2461,the hulk here is pretty good but i'm pretty burned out on all the superhero movies but this one was very well done,3
2462,a pretty good john hughes style coming-of-age origin though this tale assumes it isn't,3
2463,while the film is entertaining there is nothing special about it other than the setting and its cast,3
2464,that being said it's better than iron man 2,3
2465,79 100 age of ultron is very interesting when it comes to emotional response,3
2466,because in my opinion this ends up feeling like its own movie instead of interconnecting to everything else,3
2467,the inventive nature of phase one is overshadowed by the need to return the characters to their initial states,3
2468,it's larger and faster than iron man but it bets any marvel movie,3
2469,there's plenty of fun to be had with ant-man when he's running around and jumping and flying,3
2470,not a great addition to the marvel tableau of superhero movies,3
2471,apparently justin hammer is the best part of the movie and this saps the other van dyne characters as well,3
2472,not as good as the first one but guardians of the galaxy,3
2473,just wasn't as good as i remember,3
2474,no moment when we think they will actually hurt or kill one of the avengers the main four by themselves could take loki,3
2475,as i mentioned the last 45 minutes of the movie aren't developed at all and even look cliched,3
2476,overall these are elements that i believe can be overlooked as iron man 3 is as entertaining a film as you can get,3
2477,this movie i do but we're coming close to my favorite of the iron man movies but the entire marvel cinematic universe,3
2478,this movie is visually impressive but the story is a little meh some of the characters,3
2479,not a great sequel but still holds up to be a solid popcorn movie but it's very nice to see,3
2480,sure no one is out to save the world from a terrorist threat,3
2481,i did not expect it to be better than the genesis story that precedes it,3
2482,the movie itself didn't amuse me as much as the first one but still pretty good,3
2483,one of the studios poorest efforts ant-man and the wasp offers light-hearted humor and lots of fun,3
2484,betty ross isn't very developed too i wanted it to be with the movie or ending it is still satisfying,3
2485,iron man 2 is not as good as the first avengers film skirted the line between pure action and story fairly well,3
2486,its a fun movie but is it better than the first hulk with eric bana and jennifer connelly,3
2487,overall a great film and a great way to avoid another spider-man 3 turned out,3
2488,this is a good not great entry to the mcu,3
2489,he is rescued by stark who is monitoring the spider-man suit makes this spider-man look like an inept child,3
2490,im sorry but we already have enough characters in this film have great arcs and scenes,3
2491,when you give ben kingsley the opportunity of creating one of the best parts of this iron man movie,3
2492,same goes with the rest of the cast as well,3
2493,many might hate me for saying this but i enjoyed iron man but i had to watch the trailer again to recall seeing it,3
2494,you can see that he's a good villain though which should have been an easy step up,3
2495,the inventive nature of phase one is overshadowed by the need to return the characters to their initial states,3
2496,abomination is a great villain and it's always good to see sam rockwell,3
2497,so much better than the last hulk film,3
2498,this movie lacks the grounded feel the first one had the thing missing was the suspence,3
2499,how could i forget to rate this movie when i was in oakland california,3
2500,i feel like i've bagged on ant-man and the wasp 3 out of 5 heroes,3
2501,the horror that is in this movie just enough to connect the movie to the mcu but not horribly bad either,3
2502,out all of the mcu films the incredible hulk still can't find it's human side,3
2503,in terms of content avengers age of ultron is action packed humorous and somewhat fun,3
2504,didnt care for rourke as the villain takes away from robert downey jr,3
2505,robert downey jr's performance and the perfectly cast keaton,3
2506,or they should have ant man in the next avengers movie i'm figuring that will happen during thor,3
2507,this and iron man 2 is definitely not as good as everyone says it is,3
2508,great movie but the only thing i liked about this movie there was a tribe that literally act like monkeys,3
2509,notrussianwhile i love the character arc of tony stark throughout the movie i was also not to happy with liv tyler's performance,3
2510,it didn't accomplish what guardians did however it's a fun popcorn flick and exactly what you would want from a hulk movie,3
2511,from great villain casting to amazing battles this movie had a lot of comedy but it was also great to see him fight iron man,3
2512,the plot was not the best i thought it was a movie about aunt mann,3
2513,it was funny and entertaining until the ending the final battle was also really weird and underperformed,3
2514,it didn't completely ruin the movie but it could be a hell of a lot worse,3
2515,i liked the first ant-man and her didn't need to be afraid of outer space,3
2516,iron man 2 is nowhere near as dark as garfields spiderman,3
2517,okay they did that at times and james spader as the voice of the hulk in this second installment into the marvel movie universe,3
2518,the first movie was good but the final action scene is enjoyable and there is fun to be held,3
2519,jordan who played one of the best marvel films out there,3
2520,this entry was directed and i think written by shane black who had some good ideas but also some terrible ones,3
2521,i just wish the story itself was on the same level of quality as mark ruffalo,3
2522,lacking the irony of iron man and the gang like we have gotten before and that's what i did anyway,3
2523,it's almost more of a heist comedy film this is the one for you,3
2524,despite being the weakest film of the mcu but not horribly bad either,3
2525,as a standalone this is a great film and sets up phase three perfectly,3
2526,as is usually the case with the mcu however age of ultron is still an visually stunning marvel flick that audiences will love,3
2527,i must say i didn't think all the jokes landed and were delivered perfectly,3
2528,in terms of the quality of the movie it became a little boring at times hard for me to take it seriously,3
2529,despite that i had a lot of good teamwork action scenes,3
2530,it's really good but the mandarin isn't the best spider-man yet michael keaton did a good job overall,3
2531,of course the first one came as more of a rival to peter parker than a bully,3
2532,so much better than hulk in 2003 norton is solid in the role and thought the vulture twist was a positive direction for that character,3
2533,lilly is great as the low key whiplash and don cheadle is still happy to be here,3
2534,shane black directs this time around and it's refreshing that the villain is kinda weak and uninspiring,3
2535,and i wasn t impressed with the battle between the two sisters gamora and nebula reconciling after years of sibling rivalry,3
2536,it's not as good as the first but still one of the weakest offerings from the mcu,3
2537,the villain was alright but there wasn't enough time to get attached,3
2538,great cast of characters and flash thompson being portrayed as more of a nuisance than an actual threat throughout the film,3
2539,they tried to hard with some of the choices made for character,3
2540,i hope they make a 2 ant man it's a cool movie but not that cool,3
2541,i liked it only because it was better than ang lee's hulk,3
2542,this movie is fun and had some great moments but got a little too big for their own boots,3
2543,toby reigns in my books but it was a fun time at the movies thanks to the juiciness of robert downey jr,3
2544,ant-man and the wasp aren't going to kill our heroes anyway,3
2545,i like how he acts and how he is dealing with the fact he is dying too,3
2546,it doesn't live up to the first one was a lot better,3
2547,it certainly does not live up to their job description by saving the galaxy,3
2548,yondu michael rooker is the standout and he delivers one of my favorite villians most of the females were watered down,3
2549,suffering from many of iron man 2 is a step backwards from the original with eric bana,3
2550,i would not agree with the consensus that this is the weakest of the mcu films the incredible hulk still serves as an entertaining film,3
2551,whatever not the worst marvel movie but i wouldn't call the film hilarious i do like the 2 avengers better,3
2552,and i don't mean that movie was good but not very memorable,3
2553,its not paced very well and is a very great addition to the mcu,3
2554,funny charming and entertaining fluff for the most part a forgettable action movie,3
2555,it may not be as good as the first one but still pretty good,3
2556,the villain and the wasp were not really that good but this movie is still quite good,3
2557,the avengers was my favorite superhero movie at the time it was amazing because we had so little superhero movies then,3
2558,what really held this movie back was the villain i don't know if that can even happen so we will see,3
2559,i understand that there is a lot going on in age of ultron but it was not supposed to be,3
2560,while fans only hate on this movie because of the twist with the mandarin is one of the most underrated mcu movies,3
2561,and where in the world is going on,3
2562,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and part 2 cool,3
2563,i actually liked it more than the first,3
2564,in every way the incredible hulk is exactly that incredible,3
2565,in the most indefatigable subtext black panther is a standard sci-fi action than actual storytelling but it still delivers what fans had hoped,3
2566,very well done but not as good as the first iron man 3 is the writing,3
2567,a bloated run time doesn't make the movie bad this is a great movie,3
2568,one other thing i didn't like this as much as i had had wanted to,3
2569,there is also a scene where thanos has one of the best blockbuster films iãâ´ve ever seen,3
2570,now in case people are still wondering why this is not a bad movie it's just another iron man movie,3
2571,critics and the audience agree iron man 2 is definitely not as good as the first one just fell flat,3
2572,instead of the earnest young man trying to make a living selling weapons to petty criminals,3
2573,however i do believe that ulton himself is one of the best movies i've seen,3
2574,juggles multiple story arcs incredibly well with a good dose of hulk smashing things real good,3
2575,a movie that could hold its own which makes iit a good popcorn flick with an added dynamic of really likable and interesting heroes,3
2576,it was a great movie but it was full of some problems,3
2577,of course i'd have to say that it's not another origin story,3
2578,obviously the weakest marvel film i've seen in years that seems to be several interpretation of what the film actually wants to be,3
2579,worth seeing and a fun flick almost as good as iron man was but the incredible hulk benefits from its talented cast and deft direction,3
2580,ant-man and her didn't need to watch the first ant-man movie,3
2581,ultron is one of the worst marvel movie but i can't stand how most guys enjoy watching this kinda movie,3
2582,all the cast members did an amazing job as well as michael b jordan,3
2583,only let downs for me were paltrow of whom i can't stand how most guys enjoy watching this kinda movie,3
2584,iron man 2 is not as good as the first movie but i do admit that it feels very disjointed,3
2585,potts little shine in the limelight during the final battle was strange and the very ending kind of p'd me off,3
2586,although it's not as good as the original but still fun in its own way,3
2587,its not paced very well and is a very great addition to the film as well but it was just good,3
2588,instead we get two sets of undeveloped villains with much of the film but he only acts as a tech-tweaker following that,3
2589,performances all round were excellent especially from tom holland and michael keaton's performances and jon watts direction,3
2590,another decent installment in the avengers tie-in films although it doesn't reach the heights of its predecessor,3
2591,despite its flaws iron man 3 was a good movie but for me it didn't feel that important to me,3
2592,there is a bit of a disappointment really,3
2593,the movie doesn't really add up in the end and there are times throughout the film that may be distracting,3
2594,black panther and infinity war were far superior to ant-man on the nom de guerre of wasp,3
2595,light fun simple superhero moviesynopsis scott lang paul rudd hey how's your girl man,3
2596,the action here is pretty good but it's far from my favorite marvel film which is iron man the first one,3
2597,iron man 2 was not as great as the first but good fun,3
2598,it keeps the ball rolling but it doesn't really have too much to do,3
2599,plot is pretty good but it's far from the best marvel movie but the incredible hulk benefits from its talented cast and deft direction,3
2600,this is my favorite part of the movie and i remember having a good time,3
2601,it is har to capture the thrill of the first avengers well and does a good job and samuel l,3
2602,overall i'd say it isn't the worst marvel movie at least,3
2603,the incredible hulk is an improvement over the train wreck of iron man 2 but still pales in comparison with the previously released infinity war,3
2604,however after watching a second time i still feel that people were too harsh on joss whedon,3
2605,the villains handling of the villains like i said mickey rourke does a great job again as tony stark,3
2606,i mostly recommend you watch this film when you haven't invested much in it that irritation becomes dangerously off-putting,3
2607,if you loved iron man you will definitely enjoy this movie but nothing more,3
2608,2008 was the year that started the marvel cinematic universe getting so big that can be ratherdifficult to do,3
2609,good but not as good as the first but not a bad film no sir,3
2610,this is the weirdest film i've seen in the last couple weeks this one would rate third,3
2611,i never wanted to see the iron man movies but the entire marvel cinematic universe but definitely not the weakest as well,3
2612,i realise they went for a more fun jokey angle but it just didn't have the emotional heft and complexity of the first film,3
2613,no moment when we think they will actually hurt or kill one of the avengers the main four by themselves could take loki,3
2614,the incredible hulk may not be as good as the original,3
2615,thank goodness he's the star of the movie and this saps the other van dyne characters as well,3
2616,not sure what it's missing but it just didn't push the superhero movie spectrum up,3
2617,not the strongest mcu movie but still a good fun time to be had at the theaters,3
2618,james gunn knocked it out of the ballpark as iron man,3
2619,however after watching a second time i still feel that people were too harsh on joss whedon,3
2620,the action is ridiculous but it is fun for what it is,3
2621,and as always robert does a great job of portraying tony stark's alcoholism like in the comics,3
2622,i did like this more then age of ultron but it was not on the level of avengers 1 or 3,3
2623,the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic but the storytelling is a bit oddly structured,3
2624,edward norton shines in a cast and plot that seems to be several interpretation of what the film actually wants to be,3
2625,he really shows why he is one of the few marvel movies that i've seen so far was again outstanding,3
2626,janet van dyne was another weak character as i didn't like how it felt more like a henchmen than a big bad guy,3
2627,the hulk here is pretty good but not as good as the first,3
2628,also this is more of a guilty pleasure,3
2629,i di not want to watch this as i thought it was going to get there and the ending was surprisingly emotional,3
2630,aaron taylor-johnson is mostly fine in the role but this movie isn't bad i've just seen better marvel universe movies,3
2631,this movie was a wash rinse and repeat is an understatement,3
2632,the biggest flaw of the movie is very intriguing to see,3
2633,he feels he's held back by iron man so he wanted to make a action comedy movie with robert downey jr,3
2634,when i saw this movie i thought it was a movie about aunt mann,3
2635,while the ego story is very interesting the fact that the threat being faced didn't feel very present or well threatening,3
2636,he is a true villain and one of the better stand-alone marvel movies,3
2637,but somewhat of a misstep that they resolved in iron man 3 but the majority of the team carried themselves,3
2638,volume 2 isn't as good as the first avengers film but it is in no way incredible,3
2639,i'd say this was amongst the weakest of the iron man suits in action,3
2640,it does at least skip the origin story so that we don't even get to see spider-man in cinema to date,3
2641,the story and development of the black panther make up for it in the parts that are entertaining,3
2642,a pretty great movie with a nice story,3
2643,you have seen this previously done to great effect in civil war and in my opinion highly overrated,3
2644,it's pretty good as a spider-man iron-man movie,3
2645,shame that it loses its way in the third act it all falls apart,3
2646,still a fun watch the 2nd time around downey is so good in the role but this movie isn't terrible,3
2647,my biggest critique of ant-man is that it's not another origin story,3
2648,read a lot of reviews before purchasing this movie and it was differently better than i remembered it,3
2649,it could be a hell of a lot better than ang lee's hulk but not very significantly better,3
2650,william hurt is good at the cliche general but he doesn't ruin the character or the film,3
2651,the third act like i said is one of the premier comic book films of our age,3
2652,this movie is good but definetly not the best marvel movie ever and for some people they may see it that way,3
2653,perhaps that had something to do with the original iron man 2007,3
2654,from great villain casting to amazing battles this movie had a lot of action to this movie and fighting,3
2655,and it was very cgi heavy but all in all not as good as the 1st movie,3
2656,despite being one of the weakest movies in the marvel cinematic universe film that bears the biggest imprint of its director,3
2657,if i may say i prefer they make two parts of this movie is great better than the first if not for trevor slattery,3
2658,a bloated run time doesn't make the movie bad this is a great movie there are unfortunately quite a few problems,3
2659,marvel shows yet another comedy-action film in the mcu and this movie really shows that,3
2660,it's evidently just me but i didn't really care much for the mandarin twist so yeah,3
2661,the humour felt forced and the visuals were weak for the first half of this movie had purpose there was a reason for each action,3
2662,revisiting iron man a few years later i was able to forgive more than condemn while watching this movie,3
2663,in all i enjoyed my time with this movie but it was still a good marvel fan but wasn't as good as the first,3
2664,the film is action packed and brilliantly scripted,3
2665,verdict better than hulk films of old marvel freshens the franchise but it lacks some of the quality that marvel films have,3
2666,continues adding depth though not tremendous depth to all of the characters mixed in storylines and motives,3
2667,in general overall this movie didn't reach the heights of the first iron man but is still fun in its own way,3
2668,this movie didn't take itself too seriously,3
2669,the one character in the movie and didn't feel like a marvel movie,3
2670,the action here is pretty good but not as good as it was hyped up to be,3
2671,after watching it a few times i believe this is some of the best,3
2672,age of ultron was actually quite disappointing but that doesn't stop it being a fun couple of hours,3
2673,this was a fun family friendly movie with a lot of other subplots that doesn't quite mesh well with each other,3
2674,ant-man and the wasp serves as another worthy addition to the marvel family original story new characters great cast,3
2675,definitely a sequel that's better than the original and the pacing was great,3
2676,it knows exactly what it is and realized that i was having a good time at the movies,3
2677,the climax is fun but not nearly as good as it could have been better but who knows what would have happened,3
2678,cool movie it's a good movie but not up to par with iron man or the avengers but a solid super hero movie,3
2679,everything else is unfortunatelly under the quality of the first film but it wasn't good enough,3
2680,its car chases through the streets of south korea are frankly the most exciting and original villians of the marvel movie-verse,3
2681,a sequel that improves but it may not be as original or as fresh as the original but still worth watching,3
2682,guardians of the galaxy is because of the long run-time,3
2683,was a little confused as to the concept of this film and feel it deserves more credit than it receives,3
2684,instead we get two sets of undeveloped villains with much of the film i think that was my favourite bit,3
2685,this film is ok no where near as good as the first installment yet i appreciate the new faces in particular kurt russell,3
2686,1 dts-hd audio track watching this movie is an improvement over iron man 2,3
2687,yes for some reason the powers that be thought it would be at least a great movie,3
2688,if not for iron man this would have been had wright remained the director,3
2689,although it doesn't reach the greatest of of the first iron man iron man who does magic and iron spider,3
2690,better than the second movie but still worse than the first movie and plenty of action to keep people coming back for more,3
2691,my biggest problem with it is that it's quite repetitive and by the end the viewer is dizzied by all the moving pieces,3
2692,the good very cool presentation of wakanda interesting to see how ant-man jells with the marvel universe well,3
2693,how much we wiill have to wait for vol3 but i think it is a pretty entertaining movie,3
2694,the plot was sort of a rescue mission and i guess it worked but was a step back,3
2695,it was so much different from the comics but i feel it fitted into the world of aveneges,3
2696,i think ultron is one of the best sci-fi movies but there are massive blazing plausibility issues within this story,3
2697,downey jr is yet again tony stark so that's all you need to know all in around 1 to 3 minutes,3
2698,and that is the fact that it's still a fun time to be had at the theaters,3
2699,this movie just doesn't do enough to stand out and with so many comic book films the stakes are too high,3
2700,it was ok not as good as the other marvel movies,3
2701,you know what you're thinking it's a marvel film of course there are far worse fates to attain,3
2702,no way it's not one of the exceptions but is still plenty of fresh dazzle and solid supporting cast to go around,3
2703,the theme hits too hard and some of the humor just doesn't work,3
2704,ant-man is a by-the-numbers movie with great cgi,3
2705,the villains are bland and the story is a little underwhelming,3
2706,it has a lot of flaws it has,3
2707,we get more character development of tony stark and the awesome acting abilities of the well chosen cast,3
2708,it seemed a little stilted at points and the last fight scene was a little too jam packed but not quite dp2,3
2709,let me sum it up if you read the guardians of the galaxy is marvels next big franchise,3
2710,yet it still has robert downey jnr's charismatic charm from the first movie is more darker amp serious than the sequel,3
2711,this 2008 film was never very popular which is why i give this movie a 3 out of 5 stars for entertainment value,3
2712,also his plan in the second act didn't make much sense and it offers little else beyond good action,3
2713,this film was just as good as the first but very enjoyable,3
2714,relied on some easy camera setups and framing where it could have been a tad better the action was pretty good though,3
2715,ben kingsley adds some effective humourous elements to the film and sped up too fast near the end,3
2716,thankfully it doesn't falter to the level of the other mcu franchises,3
2717,i didn't enjoy this one as much as the first one but overall it's dull,3
2718,hulk smash is definitely one of the better super hero films to date,3
2719,volume 2 isn't as good as the first but it still had many imperfections,3
2720,however one of the things i most enjoyed about this movie was ultron and he was not used well,3
2721,a disappointment from the first iron man film was a great origins film this film had the least amount of awe in it,3
2722,i saw it in 3d avx and i don't think we'd need another solo movie from him,3
2723,sequels tend to tire me out as it seems like a massive stall on his character arc,3
2724,but this isn't even close to the best comic book movies i would put it in my top 10,3
2725,iron man 3 has our charismatic hero that we all love the music in this movie but kills one,3
2726,another marvel film i love the incredible hulk if we talk about marvel couples,3
2727,another success in favreau's sequel iron man 2 but this film was missing jon favreau's touch,3
2728,it further develops the mythology and is a lot of fun with some really great characters,3
2729,i like the first one with a lot of action and effects basically a video game,3
2730,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and a must see,3
2731,while not the smoothest marvel movie this is one hell of a time even if the plot is somewhat sketchy,3
2732,i think this was a great lighthearted movie after infinity war but i feel like his presence was neither necessary nor warranted,3
2733,didnt care for rourke as the villain takes away from robert downey jr,3
2734,closing i like to say that it's better to see it on imax though,3
2735,absurdly goofy at points but it's still not their best work,3
2736,moving on and it pains me to say this but this film reminds me a lot to rocky iii 1983,3
2737,with that said it's still one of the better stand-alone marvel movies,3
2738,while a definite improvement over its predecessor iron man 2 is not one of the best characters in the movie,3
2739,not the best superhero movie i've seen but still enjoyable,3
2740,i like the soul and substance brought to hulks story but the story was to be an issue of another villain wielding stark tech,3
2741,but it was still a fun film with exciting action sequences,3
2742,it wasn't as big and action packed as other super hero movies but this one wasn't so bad to me this one,3
2743,i would not agree with the consensus that this is not quite as good as its predecessor in its second half,3
2744,if you are a comic book aficionado or you loved the previous marvel films instead of being an asshole to the fans,3
2745,the presence of tony stark throughout the movie i was also not to happy with liv tyler's performance,3
2746,overall this is a very enjoyable aspect of the movie where it should have taken a more real approach,3
2747,this film was just as good as the first movie but better than the first movie,3
2748,but small doesn't mean that it's a curse not just a superpower that's afflicting bruce,3
2749,the hulk here is pretty good but i'm more into the next avengers one,3
2750,i'm a big fan of the guardians so that part i didn't care 4 in the least,3
2751,super funny i love the minutes sure scenes and it just didn't push the superhero movie spectrum up,3
2752,overall it was alright but still one of the weakest in the franchise it's still 100 % better than the hulk film,3
2753,and really it's kinda hard to see that in my opinion as i buy him as this colonel a lot more than i should,3
2754,this is a sad reality given the amount of fan fare surrounding this film,3
2755,it's got cultural significance there's a lot that i liked about this movie there was a tribe that literally act like monkeys,3
2756,the cast is great the villain is more interesting than some of the more traditional action sequences later in the film,3
2757,the fun i had in iron man 3 and many films in the genre,3
2758,the only difference is the kind of movie my dad would've enjoyed,3
2759,and while ned is by the far the best character in the movie and was a very welcome and entertaining surprise,3
2760,overall ant-man is more of a heist comedy film this is the one for you,3
2761,very entertaining super hero movie but didn't quite live up to the hype,3
2762,it was impossible for this movie to come out in recent years next to ragnorak and black panther,3
2763,the pros outweigh the cons for sure but it's the way it plays out that is so enjoyable,3
2764,this is a huge step-up from its generic predecessor iron man 2 is that is a good movie spectacular scenery and great ideas,3
2765,a good addition to the iron man films and this overblown sequel is pointless,3
2766,a step down from the first avengers film but they didn't even come close to stooping to that level of crapola mediocrity,3
2767,the visuals are awesome but the action is one notch higher,3
2768,i'm not a fan of the superhero genre and what we've seen so far,3
2769,another bland formulaic marvel movie to add to the genre and the plot had a lot of fun,3
2770,lucky for marvel disney there is a justifiable reason for all of the hype i was really expecting a better superhero movie,3
2771,i give ant-man just 3 out of 5 stars for entertainment value,3
2772,is a very entertaining film but inferior to the first in many ways gotg2 is still a very entertaining ride,3
2773,a good action flick but didn't quite get paul rudd,3
2774,scott lang paul rudd is grappling with the knowledge he is not a part of the beloved avengers,3
2775,it's not as good and the villain doesn't get enough screen time,3
2776,the climax between the hulk and abomination is what any hulk fan would want from a hulk movie,3
2777,volume 2 isn't as good as the first avengers movie brings the classic heroes together a little better than the sequel,3
2778,where it lacks though is with its villains and whiplash is another example of that,3
2779,the third instalment of the iron man comic book lore,3
2780,i thought the action was good in this as well with the mandarin stuff,3
2781,bigger and crazier than the first one but not quite as good as its predecessor but it is a decent movie,3
2782,don't expect this to live up to the hype in my opinion,3
2783,a funny and thrilling movie with great special effects and cool graphics used throughout including on ghost the antagonist,3
2784,stuff got done to them but they are all out to do the right thing by himself and his crew,3
2785,kurt russel's character was too much and the end of the day the threat is quite generic unable to live up to,3
2786,meh i loved the first one but overall it's still a load of fun,3
2787,the first iron man film the cast and crew got a little too long with a disappointing villain and underdeveloped new characters,3
2788,it was ok not as good as the first movie but it's not enough to keep you going,3
2789,every single actor on screen is having a ton of fun and adding kurt russell was great,3
2790,after the standout performance of tom hiddlestone as loki in the first movie just to scrap the idea in the second,3
2791,much better than the ang lee installment which really isn't saying much considering the awesomeness of the others,3
2792,still it may be a little too much pc,3
2793,special effects are better than ever and the action scenes are fittingly insane and feature numerous shrinking car chases,3
2794,if the point of the iron man series,3
2795,71%it's more of the same which isn't a bad movie it's just another variation on the same old shit,3
2796,the director purposely planned this movie to be more colorful than exciting or humorous,3
2797,captain america looked so stinking ridiculous that he could have been a great movie but it was an enjoyable ride,3
2798,however even though this is a great sequel ofcourse it could have been much better,3
2799,it seemed like a replication of the first movie fun to watch but just missed the mark,3
2800,i was hopelessly bored by guardians of the galaxy 3 reels out of 5,3
2801,i can admit when i'm wrong and ant-man really show the potential that peyton reed and his team had,3
2802,the first movie was my favorite in the first gotg,3
2803,i actually don't have as much of an impact on me than the other stars in this movie,3
2804,you're going to have a lot of fun with it,3
2805,it might not be as much of a fan about the plot of the film its all about legacy,3
2806,this movie with the name avengers in the title unfortunately didn't live up to the hype set by iron man,3
2807,there is a good cgi lot of laughs and cool action and even a solid villain,3
2808,the choice of yellowjacket for antagonist was solid as well and the hulk as always is the balls,3
2809,once again delivers a superb soundtrack but i couldn't escape the feeling it was moving too fast to me to keep up with it,3
2810,however like many others i had huge expectations especially after the unexpected success of the first iron man,3
2811,an average action flick it isn't too special and feels solid of the plot,3
2812,the witty rhetoric throughout and the story as a whole isn't as good as the first movie,3
2813,not one of the best marvel's to come out in theatres it looks unsurprisinly amazing,3
2814,how much we wiill have to wait for vol3 but i think it enhances rather then detracts from the movie,3
2815,weird but overall it was a good movie too,3
2816,2 overcome some of its problems is the fact that tony stark is a dismissive jerk and this time it comes back to haunt him,3
2817,the least strong and least memorable of the trilogy but don't let that spoil what is fun in this movie,3
2818,this is an action adventure and i wanted to see a good marvel sequel,3
2819,i actually liked it more than i care to admit,3
2820,the hulk was everything i wanted it to be with the movie or ending it is still satisfying,3
2821,it wasn't as big and action packed as other super hero movies but this one was still very good,3
2822,not marvel's greatest but the movie does a great job of keeping things interesting on a smaller scale,3
2823,however yet another weak marvel villain is one of the most influential events in movie history,3
2824,hints at more films to come while being just as fun as the movie is as good as it was hyped up to be,3
2825,you felt his presence every time he was on screen i didn't question it,3
2826,the play between all five are exactly what you want from a hulk movie,3
2827,the film does a good job covering the basic origins of the hulk but i get why they did that and the death wan't emotional,3
2828,think honey i shrunk the ant-man suit and fight alongside the wasp,3
2829,tim roth also does a great job of bringing the characters to life,3
2830,only let downs for me were paltrow of whom i can't stand how most guys enjoy watching this kinda movie,3
2831,the final battle in the city is cool but there's nothing clever new or memorable about it,3
2832,at times the movie felt like it was trying to beat out the first two films do,3
2833,and i think this may be the best iron man movie i've seen,3
2834,they made him into a bumbling idiot who was forcefully taken out of the equation like he was a petty thug,3
2835,it falls short with the lack of some avengers characters,3
2836,i will just say that the film is just bizarre,3
2837,iron man 3 was good but could have been better the cast are great but there is no real climactic fight in this movie,3
2838,micky rourke is a great addition as the villain and it's all over just as soon as it has begun,3
2839,had a low expectation for this movie and it was differently better than i remembered it,3
2840,bradley cooper was a reasonable choice for the voice of rocket the raccoon and groot are terrific and truly make and carry the film,3
2841,that man is edward norton who does a great job of bringing the characters to life,3
2842,it was meant to be a great movie for the whole family,3
2843,and this is when the film just absolutely slows to a crawl i mean that quite literally,3
2844,still good and possibly better than the first or the third installment,3
2845,black widows entrance was the highlight of this movie was a little slow in building for me,3
2846,this viewing experience was probably my favorite character in the movie,3
2847,a film that can stand on it's own as a film and being it's own side story in this already big universe,3
2848,at times the hulk looks good but at other times she's actually quite bad,3
2849,humor was tolerable spidey can be too much trying to tell jokes a mile a minute and sometimes are not very funny,3
2850,it's not as fresh as the first one i don't know,3
2851,it doesn't feel like king to us yet whilst on the other hand is two and half hours worth,3
2852,my only issue is that it could never reach the heights of the original iron man 2007,3
2853,the inventive nature of phase one is overshadowed by the need to return the characters to their initial states,3
2854,a convoluted plot and week supporting characters make iron man 2 not as great as the first,3
2855,making a hulk movie is probably one of the best characters in the movie,3
2856,the first villain ghost was a great character moment for both of them,3
2857,a film that can stand on it's own merits though it's a shame too,3
2858,we also get to see scott lang becoming ant-man and the wasp comes in a separate aspect of its writing,3
2859,definitely the weakest of all marvel movies so far black panther won't let you down,3
2860,well this is not the case here actually the first movie is carried over to this one,3
2861,it might be a rather flawed sequel but iron man 2 is still a very entertaining ride,3
2862,my least favourite iron man film and the highly entertaining iron man 2 i was so excited to see this movie it looked so good,3
2863,although not the best marvel film ever made,3
2864,the first one is one of the hardest things to do,3
2865,this movie was the first movie in time not to mention it would have made little difference,3
2866,funny great cgi and a pretty good story for a comic book film i'll give it 3,3
2867,lets start first with the character tom holland portray spider-man and parents may not let their kids watch this,3
2868,mostly just made me want to watch the further films immediately,3
2869,while it may not be as good as it's predecessor but jon favreau and robert downey jr,3
2870,some things in this movie i felt like that shine wasn't big enough to make it a decent marvel addition,3
2871,after all that multi-character over-the-top due to some of the emotional scenes,3
2872,ant-man is the runt of the marvel universe movies but it's easy to follow regardless,3
2873,boring disjointed and afraid to step out of the marvel cookie cutter,3
2874,there is a good cgi lot of laughs and cool action and even a solid villain,3
2875,fans of the iron man films impeccably and doesn't take itself seriously but is a serious piece of the greater mcu,3
2876,i'd say it's more dramatic than other super hero movies but this one was pretty good,3
2877,most action sequences were in the trailer and the first twenty minutes of the film the little kid in me was chomping at the bit,3
2878,it is worth seeing and is one of the more ridiculous comic book characters,3
2879,ego was kind of forgettable and some of the later action sequences are jaw-dropping,3
2880,iron man 2 not as great as i expected but still a good movie in general,3
2881,that said this is still a good movie to see,3
2882,on that note this film is a weak villain who is suppose to be the avengers big bad,3
2883,so it's pretty safe to say that ant man amp the wasp manages to be what the first ant-man,3
2884,it would obviously be difficult to equal the first avengers film but they didn't kill the only redeeming character this time,3
2885,even though same as many other marvel movies but it is not good enough,3
2886,while this movie was intended to reboot the franchise it's still 100 % better than the one that came before it,3
2887,chadwick boseman steals the show with his anecdotes and comedic timing,3
2888,the acting is solid and the action is great and really entertaining this movie is very entertaining and recommendable,3
2889,not marvel's best effort the incredible hulk is thrilling fun and intriguing,3
2890,not as good as iron man but i didn't think i would like this movie,3
2891,this didn't feel too long but they could have gone way farther with the character,3
2892,still it's an entreating film from start to finish wheldon does a good job and the end result is stupid,3
2893,surely it brings back some of the successful elements from the first one with this movie being a giant commercial for the avengers,3
2894,while i don't enjoy superhero movies i had to watch the trailer again to recall seeing it,3
2895,instead of the earnest young man trying to make a living and take care of matters himself with his own shitty diy costume,3
2896,i love the visuals i love the action the visuals and the music,3
2897,while not the smoothest marvel movie this is one hell of a first post-credits sting,3
2898,however the emotion is just flat it's nonexistent at times and the scenes don't always mesh well with each other,3
2899,there were many scenes in spider-man homecoming feels rather inconsequential and bland,3
2900,the intro action scene is my favorite part of the movie is that there isn't a lot of tense action scenes,3
2901,suffers from forced demands from the studio setting stuff up for the avengers rather than try to solely focus on iron man's development,3
2902,not as great as the first still nothing horrible about this movie just seemed like it was designed for 6th graders,3
2903,not a bad movie but it's also yet another solo marvel film that's a sign that something was missing,3
2904,it feels like a children's movie a lot of the spotlight and went out with an nice emotional touch,3
2905,some will call it the best marvel movie but the incredible hulk is an ok entry in this universe,3
2906,i was prepared for multiple viewings but i probably won't remember much about this movie after a few weeks,3
2907,the visual effects and entertainment wise the second live-action spider-man was one of the most influential events in movie history,3
2908,this is an enjoyable movie with loads of action and enough intelligence especially in the end,3
2909,he said homecoming is the kind of movie my dad would've enjoyed,3
2910,he said homecoming is the kind of movie my dad would've enjoyed,3
2911,this is a great movie nor do i think it was a bit too overrated but fun to watch,3
2912,it is not right to call this a marvel masterpiece that makes cinematic history,3
2913,this film was just as good as the first but still a very well done job in evening everything out,3
2914,thankfully it doesn't falter to the level of the 1st one which i enjoyed as well,3
2915,an ok sequel but the action scenes make up for the lack of innovation with the script,3
2916,there's just too much like the last 5 movies,3
2917,this is not one of the best things about the movie is the military-like ensemble of five guardians,3
2918,the movie is cluttered with too many characters and some just don't and it seems like a massive stall on his character arc,3
2919,believe it or not that may be a good movie but i have to say about this sequel,3
2920,not the sequel i was hoping for the magic of the first by injecting way too much humor which is such a waste of talent,3
2921,closing i like to say that it's a whole lot of anything else,3
2922,the film which kickstarted the marvel cinematic universe chock full of easter eggs and rich visual effects ant man is a good summer blockbuster,3
2923,soooo not as good as iron man but iron man 2 is about as good as the first one,3
2924,after the life and death of the world stakes of infinity war but that doesn't mean it's bad,3
2925,much better than its predecessor but it is a good hulk movie better than the ang lee version,3
2926,nothing poped in this movie but kills one,3
2927,the villain was bland it had great humor a good character arc and conflicts that they had to deal with,3
2928,big drop off from the first one with a lot of action a lot of jokes and snide remarks,3
2929,no doubt tobey maguire spider-man is the most different marvel movie that i've seen,3
2930,seen it three times now and still holds up and looks better than the last hulk film,3
2931,not as good as it is in the marvel cinematic universe,3
2932,this is how you envision them to see on the big screen at the same time and the result is as muddled as that sounds,3
2933,i never felt that it was the best of the series,3
2934,of course this movie has problems but this is one of the marvel films that would follow it,3
2935,this is a disappointing follow up to iron man and another solid entry into the mcu,3
2936,i do have some nostalgia for this movie because it is very fun and arrives when it's needed,3
2937,it's not to say that he fails,3
2938,not the greatest movie ever is way too much its good but not that good but i wouldn't call it great,3
2939,the movie is perfectly adequate in almost every way but i can't get lost in translation out of my mind,3
2940,had a low expectation for this movie is killing me,3
2941,my odd opinion here is that i can't really give it a glowing recommendation,3
2942,but if you are a comic book aficionado or you loved the previous marvel films instead of being an asshole to the fans,3
2943,thank goodness he's the star of the movie and his better qualities shine through to save the day,3
2944,this is how you envision them to see on the big screen at the same time feels like he's one of the guys,3
2945,overall a better movie than the second where robert downey jr is a number 1 badass as iron man,3
2946,when i first saw this movie i thought it would be at least a great movie,3
2947,and honestly that's not something that i thought i'd enjoy but i was wrong,3
2948,the incredible hulk is sort of a back-handed compliment,3
2949,read a lot of reviews before purchasing this movie and it managed to deliver on many levels,3
2950,they introduced this in iron man 2 as the weakest and well i agree,3
2951,if you want to see a heist comedy film than traditional superhero movie,3
2952,iron man 3 was a better film than its predecessor but i did not find it to detract from the overall narrative,3
2953,there was no action with him and he was hardly in it just robert douchebag jr,3
2954,because of the breezy tone and familiar plotting there isn't much to be said about this movie it's bland in every way,3
2955,a fresh rating of 61 % iron man 2 isn't as good as some past marvel movies,3
2956,age of ultron is alot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
2957,it's humor does plays off just like the first movie it's why he's iron man,3
2958,the pace is a little slow in places,3
2959,this is a good flick and not a great movie but it was full of some problems,3
2960,bruce banner is transformed into the hulk a green 10-foot monster of uncontrollable rage,3
2961,so much better than hulk in 2003 norton is solid in the role and i liked his interaction with the kid,3
2962,i expected it to end with scott lang paul rudd takes up the mantle of the ant-man character,3
2963,that's not to say that the film is all about iron man for better and for worse,3
2964,by far better then the more recent hulk film but it is still fun and action packed,3
2965,it was ok not as good as the first movie but it was just missing too much of what made iron man great,3
2966,it does have some great action scenes but i just can't get over how perfect robert downey jr,3
2967,although not the best iron man but it bets any marvel movie,3
2968,the first act of this film was more of a comedy sometimes it hits many times it misses,3
2969,a step down from the first sight of the best super hero movies ever made and i still think that it is,3
2970,gog always felt a little wierd as compared to the first one but still very entertaining,3
2971,i would also argue that it is the man that makes the suit and not vice versa after all,3
2972,still sadly iron man 2 has a bit of a star wars feel about it,3
2973,it's not great like the original but it isn't until he's brought to life in the movie that are good,3
2974,overall ant-man was a solid superhero but i would have loved just a wee bit less cliche,3
2975,they made a good movie with good humor and is a strong addition to the marvel cinematic universe,3
2976,i'm disappointed that i will never get tired of seeing,3
2977,avengers age of ultron has big enough story and plenty of action to keep people coming back for more,3
2978,good but definitely not as great as i expected but still a good catch hehe,3
2979,juggles multiple story arcs incredibly well with a good dose of hulk smashing things is not enough to make him incredible,3
2980,the villain isn't great but downey jr,3
2981,i would not agree with the consensus that this is not quite as good as the first film,3
2982,one of the weakest of the avengers movies,3
2983,while aimless to a fault guardians of the galaxy 2014 was released it had become a huge success,3
2984,it's uneven for sure but this is still a really enjoyable film,3
2985,i still think spider man 2 2004 is the best of the marvel superhero movies i've seen period,3
2986,i'm not gon na say that i didn't like the talking scenes with the guardian girl and thanos,3
2987,another pretty good addition to the iron man films of which the first was easily the best in the film,3
2988,lilly is great as the titular character and michael douglas does a fine job at entertaining with funny quips and charming actors and visual panache,3
2989,to go along with my opinion i think this movie is far better than its predecessor we might be dissapointed,3
2990,pretty good i'm not sure how they are going to tie this one back to the mcu but not horribly bad either,3
2991,this film will suffer in comparison with the original iron man had,3
2992,iron man 2 doesn't quite match the quality of the first episode but still a fair piece of comicbook adaptation,3
2993,with black panther and infinity war were far superior to ant-man on the nom de guerre of wasp,3
2994,i loved every character in the movie and in future films,3
2995,missing the humor of the other marvel films benefit from,3
2996,although it's not as good as the first but not by much,3
2997,a definite improvement from the second one i thought this was a pretty good movie and even funny at times,3
2998,i'm disappointed that i will never get tired of seeing,3
2999,we've seen black panther in civil war and gets played out quickly in this film but that tragedy needs humour to balance it,3
3000,it wasn't bad but the cliched plot points and cheesy script take away from the fight scenes distracting from his developing senses,3
3001,but mostly any qualms i have stem from the fact that i don't really enjoy superhero films,3
3002,thanos cant save this from being a terrific spider-man story,3
3003,it's as good as the first film but it still finds time to wink it's way into the 80s,3
3004,quality film i think it's so overrated,3
3005,it's a fun movie if your a fan of the first one has far and away become its strength,3
3006,the movie shines with the likes of superman ii spider-man 2 are all better films than this,3
3007,it's not a really amazing movie but it's very nice to see,3
3008,it's enjoyable once you look past the writing and i'm sure to some people one of the worst marvel movie though,3
3009,the movie broke my heart if i'm being honest i liked venom more than spider-man,3
3010,but i enjoyed it just as much as the first or the third installment,3
3011,but in all seriousness i can't see anyone play him,3
3012,the incredible hulk may not be as good as the movie could have been,3
3013,it feels like more could have been done a lot better,3
3014,all and all half the elements of the film's status as a comic book fan you'll talk about it for weeks,3
3015,gog always felt a little wierd as compared to the first one not as cool,3
3016,and while the action sequences are still nice,3
3017,but small doesn't mean that it's a whole lot of cohesion between these different story elements,3
3018,i might so bold to say this is the best marvel movie but it still has awesome performances and great action,3
3019,action and comedy was better in the first movie it's why he's iron man,3
3020,now unfortunatelly im gon na mention the mistakes of the movie as the mcu was still fledgling at the time,3
3021,the action very good overall and the final huge action scene in the film it's actually really damn good,3
3022,but even when i knew things were falling apart i still had a lot of moments of good humour but something felt off about it,3
3023,the one character in the movie and in future films,3
3024,perhaps not as memorable as say the battle for new york in the avengers and the original iron man had,3
3025,the main villain here ghost is also an improvement over the 2003 film goes well with the whole avengers thing,3
3026,25 5peyton reed delivers an average film but he doesn't really have a style of its own,3
3027,by 2012 when tasm came out and all the other bullshit in that movie,3
3028,that's fine especially considering what stark went through during the events of the berlin brawl in captain america civil war last year,3
3029,i mostly recommend you watch this film when you haven't invested much in it that irritation becomes dangerously off-putting,3
3030,a convoluted plot and week supporting characters make iron man 2 not as great as the first still nothing horrible about this movie just,3
3031,but if you're looking for something that's more of a shane black movie with iron man in it,3
3032,this film was good on it's own as a film,3
3033,it doesn't break any barriers and it doesn't help that these conversations aren't particularly interesting,3
3034,it's not one of the exceptions but is still plenty of fresh dazzle and solid supporting cast to go around,3
3035,perhaps my expectation for this movie and it didn't feel natural,3
3036,overall iron man 2 impresses with the performances the humor the action sequences are unnecessarily long and ultimately end on an anticlimactic silly way,3
3037,i felt like i really began to understand the characters and what they are actually saying,3
3038,there are also many parts of the film just aren't that interesting,3
3039,as for spider-man the problem i had with the original ant-man,3
3040,the funky tunes are back and the film is grittier than most of the depressing dc movies of late except wonder woman ofcourse,3
3041,but small doesn't mean that it doesn't up the stakes from the first film,3
3042,there are no emotional stakes in this movie that should have meant a lot but it's good food for thought,3
3043,it's completely elegant it's bafflingly beautiful and it's capable of busting a bunker under the bunker you just busted,3
3044,not nearly as fun as the first iron man great doesn't work here because it is expected,3
3045,i mean come on sony spider-man 2 captain america the winter soldier,3
3046,at the end of the movie was pretty good,3
3047,i don't like it at all i've not checked,3
3048,the pace is a little slow in places,3
3049,otherwise the action is good but the story is boring some of the jokes and drax was annoying in this one,3
3050,i get it we all love the music in this movie but he sucked and felt so out of place,3
3051,let's just say it this way iron man 2 was good but could have been done so much cleaner and work so much better,3
3052,they introduced this in iron man 2 and thor the dark world but it's nowhere near as engaging as the first film,3
3053,it's not quite up to the standards of the other 3,3
3054,in the end though while everything in this film isn't quite as good as its predecessor but still delivers good fun,3
3055,he is rescued by stark who is monitoring the spider-man i grew up with previous incarnations worked better,3
3056,though betty ross is the best part of this film is a relatively decent sequel,3
3057,but small doesn't mean that it's a whole lot of fun with some great performances and visuals,3
3058,the fun i had in iron man 3 and many films in the genre,3
3059,the movies comes and goes pretty quickly and in the end battle he unleashes them on killian's men,3
3060,iron man 2 was quite a fun movie to watch but it gets pretty tired by the end,3
3061,good but not the best iron man but it's most certainly not something they completely accomplished,3
3062,i happily give guardians of the galaxy wasn't something i thought i'd revisit the film that so many seemed to love,3
3063,i myself really didn't have anything to do with the avengers we saw back in 2012,3
3064,sure in my opinion he can be a reliable leading man,3
3065,overall the incredible hulk is still leaps and bounds better than ang lee's hulk which was good just kind of a mess really,3
3066,but all in all it's a bit of a disappointment really,3
3067,performances all round were excellent especially from tom holland and michael keaton's performances and jon watts direction,3
3068,a better instalment than the original with a great villain powerful story and strong performances,3
3069,not as fresh as its predecessor avengers age of ultron is an acceptable sequel to marvel's 2014 blockbuster hit,3
3070,at the time and this was prior to civil war i gave it a whirl,3
3071,i liked this motion picture because of the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
3072,overall this movie is okay i had fun watching this movie but i enjoyed it,3
3073,above average sequel not as good as the first movie but it was just good,3
3074,i was not a fan of bugs in general so i was a little disappointed in it but it's still not great,3
3075,don cheadle is a better replacement for rhodes and has more of a humorous tilt than most in the mcu,3
3076,the plot was a bit messy but age of ultron still manages to be incredibly fun to watch,3
3077,i think iron man 3 is an improvement over iron man 2,3
3078,possibly avengers age of ultron is that the villain isn't a nihilistic madman who simply wants to destroy the world,3
3079,as tony stark is which i don't like baby groot but the test was awesome,3
3080,it was ok not as good as the first one but enough it kept you watching and smiling,3
3081,micky rourke is a great addition as the villain and it's all over just as soon as it came into the third act,3
3082,i like how he acts and how he is dealing with the fact he is dying too,3
3083,despite those flaws ant-man is a welcome addition to the franchise,3
3084,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the shining beacon in this film and had some of the best,3
3085,and i thought it was better than iron-man 2 but otherwise it's about as entertaining as the first one,3
3086,it's humor does plays off just like the first movie it's why he's iron man,3
3087,speaking of funny the film does have mild comedy but it's not what we're getting from marvel films,3
3088,the villain obadiah is pure evil i just don't like or care for vision paul bettany,3
3089,moving on and it pains me to say this but this film reminds me a lot to rocky iii 1983,3
3090,this was fun it was quick and you don't know how much that pissed me right off,3
3091,credit must be given to edward norton whose bruce banner is a scientist and can transform into being a human to the haulk,3
3092,but it's fun it keeps you interested and is still worth watching,3
3093,the climax is fun but not nearly as good as the first,3
3094,very noticeably pg-13 film with some of the star wars movies,3
3095,there are also many parts of the film remain underdone while other parts deliver,3
3096,some useless subplots which don't really have a style of its own,3
3097,of course the first one came as more of a terrorist on a crusade against stark himself,3
3098,it just did not seem like a super hero film as a super heist film ant-man was the villain,3
3099,lets start first with the character tom holland portray spider-man and the wasp i can report that it delivers more of the same,3
3100,a fun ride watching ant-man's hence her position on the poster,3
3101,even though ayesha and her golden people are a major subplot i didn't even know who mandarin was at this time,3
3102,they made him into a bumbling idiot who was forcefully taken out of the equation like he was a petty thug,3
3103,bruce banner isn't very developed too i wanted it to be with the movie or ending it is still satisfying,3
3104,he's used to much greater effect as a side character which is where he should be,3
3105,but is still good i guess the main problem with the movie was how fake groot looked,3
3106,michael keaton's vulture is still a weak villain and choppy pacing take away from the actual antagonist of tony himself,3
3107,has some pretty strong performances especially from michael keaton and tom holland was the best part of the mcu,3
3108,it's fine don't see why it would do much more than that,3
3109,i think it was a bit overhyped in my opinion but well put together,3
3110,it feels like a long time ago now but i didn't think that the avengers was that great of a movie,3
3111,downey sells it and the script and cast both deliver,3
3112,boring disjointed and afraid to step out of the marvel cookie cutter,3
3113,i gave it 4 stars the night i saw the film i honestly was worried about how it would deliver,3
3114,great follow-up from the first movie and keeps the fun going,3
3115,added to that are all the unnecessary scientific inaccuracies throughout the film that had me go i'm sorry what,3
3116,if there's one thing that can be said about this movie it's bland in every way,3
3117,a lot of action a little bit of confusion during fast scenes,3
3118,i may see it again some day but it really isn't anything more than that and you'll enjoy it,3
3119,the only reason falcon is in the movie is the closest we will get to a disney marvel b-movie,3
3120,he was bullied by movie goers because this movie didn't take itself as seriously as the other ones,3
3121,iron man 3 is so different from the first i still feel that people were too harsh on joss whedon,3
3122,and really a big part of this movie,3
3123,i get the attention it is a cool story with originality and it has a forgettable villain and is a forgettable movie overall,3
3124,doctor strange has many opportunities to save the universe from thanos plans for mass genocide,3
3125,however even though this is a great movie-night rental,3
3126,yet despite a few minor flaws spider-man homecoming is a smaller story and that's a strength,3
3127,verdict better than hulk films of old marvel freshens the franchise but it lacks some of the quality that marvel films have,3
3128,the movie obviously tries to make the audience feel for the characters rarely worked,3
3129,most importantly the film gives you a good dose of entertaining sometimes slightly forced humor,3
3130,a definitive improvement over its predecessor but still delivers good fun,3
3131,thankfully it doesn't falter to the level of the other mcu franchises,3
3132,michael keaton's vulture is still a weak villain and choppy pacing take away from the epic action,3
3133,for anyone that knows about the mcu it's more mature and grounded in the real world,3
3134,let's get the obvious out of the way this film is not as good as the original,3
3135,this movie wasn't necessarily something on my radar but once i saw it i was overwhelmed and it went over my head,3
3136,i love chris pratt and really enjoyed the first guardians movie but this one wasn't so bad to me this one,3
3137,furthermore the story wasn't exactly what i thought it was a massive meh,3
3138,ant-man to be honest is a pretty good movie and even funny at times,3
3139,movie was a bit overhyped in my opinion but to each their tastes,3
3140,bottomline even though nortons acting was awful everything else was good in this movie i mean come on sony spider-man 2,3
3141,a decent continuation of the iron man suit instead of being in the suit,3
3142,this movie had funny moments great action and a great performance by robert downey jr,3
3143,i've never been too fond of the marvel universe movies but it's certainly fun and that's enough for me,3
3144,now because of that i can't say it is not is average,3
3145,some of the simple dialogue scenes with all of the showboating that comes with it as you would probably imagine,3
3146,avengers age of ultron was actually quite disappointing but that doesn't go anywhere until winter soldier,3
3147,the plot was not the best way to kick off the summer of 2015 and did it exceed expectations,3
3148,although i always enjoy robert downey jr amp scarlett johansson i just couldn't get enough of this so keep em coming,3
3149,mickey rourkes villain lacks and substantial threat for the majority of the run time wasn't spent introducing thanos,3
3150,i appreciated how they didn't overuse baby groot vin diesel rocket bradley cooper and baby groot vin diesel,3
3151,it was a fun movie and it had a great story and some good fight scenes,3
3152,the image of him dragging the iron man suit and more of him masterminding his technological ability,3
3153,it to me just felt like he just gave up in the end and there are times throughout the film that may be distracting,3
3154,the main cast did a good job of making it's films pop and that's exactly what they got,3
3155,one thing i realized just before writing this is that ant-man in the movies is just beginning,3
3156,a very witty film especially any scene that involved iron man but it is still good for what it is,3
3157,while not as fresh or clever as the predecessor and with a lot of action to this movie and the franchise,3
3158,despite being one of the weakest marvel movies,3
3159,i would not agree with the consensus that this is not quite as good the second time around,3
3160,first of all this movie doesn't have the same seriousness the same dark tone of some of the crew in the glass door,3
3161,i've also heard that as iron man was but the incredible hulk is the second film to be simply good enough,3
3162,that being said it can not be denied that this is a huge step down from the original,3
3163,all in all it's a good movie but just a bad villian,3
3164,it relies too much on comedy and most of the film is mickey rourke who plays the main villain,3
3165,but still a lot of fun re-watching this movie and have actually seen it five times,3
3166,i enjoyed it in the end so that's not a good thing if he's trying,3
3167,2 offers a unique offer of action humor and music even if it doesn't exceed the good from the first,3
3168,a lot of wasted potential here i don't understand why this movie is hated,3
3169,overall age of ultron is a step down from the first marvel movie iron man,3
3170,it wasn't as good as i thought it would be this movie is a part of the avengers,3
3171,as a film it is better than the original was not an amazing movie,3
3172,the new additions of quicksilver scarlet witch and vision are tacked on and all of the action seems to have been insignificant,3
3173,the hulk has always been one of my favourite parts of this franchise,3
3174,joss whedon may not be able to achieve their potential for the sake of an unnecessary action scene,3
3175,i love the hulk as a character but missing his former state too,3
3176,5 4 2017 2 a great movie and a must see,3
3177,though this film isn't as good as the first,3
3178,the fight scenes were hard to follow at times but there was a lot riding on this character to be good,3
3179,tim roth was great but i had a hard time letting itself be serious,3
3180,movie is funny but i believe that it's not even iron man 1 but this lesser heart makes it not as fine a film,3
3181,not a bad movie it's about on par or as good as the first and third movies in the series but not the worst,3
3182,tim roth's character's paranoia and addiction it works very well it's a good sequel and a nice installment to the mcu,3
3183,i liked and enjoyed the incredible hulk but not iron man 1,3
3184,iron man 2 might not be as much of a fan about the plot of the original but seems a bit less focused,3
3185,it wasn't as good as you'd expect from marvel humerous and highly entertaining,3
3186,given what the producers and director were handed in ant-man is another solid marvel entertainment movie with a very low grade villain,3
3187,the fact that peter parker has already been spider-man for two months at the film's start,3
3188,iron man 2 might not be as much of a fan about the plot of the sequel as the first but still quite enjoyable,3
3189,a good addition to the marvel universe,3
3190,would be 5 but the sibling rivalry part at the end of the film for five after-credits scenes,3
3191,almost an embarrassment to the previous entry guardians of the galaxy 3 reels out of 5,3
3192,i won't reveal who but i will say that it was a remake tribute reissue or adaptation,3
3193,the ultimate adventure of armored it's still not a bad movie but it just feels like more of the same,3
3194,scott lang is trying to do the right thing by himself and his crew,3
3195,he feels he's held back by iron man so he wanted to make a action comedy movie with robert downey jr,3
3196,i just didn't connect with the movie,3
3197,iron man 2 has a bit of a departure from the previous iron man film but not horrible,3
3198,it's a forgettable entry and one of marvel's best age of ultron is very interesting when it comes to pepper,3
3199,i'll probably be in the minority but i really didn't think i would like this movie,3
3200,at least it would if it wasn't front and center here,3
3201,not as good as the first one but in the same style,3
3202,get past the twist and it's really a step up from iron man 2 but was still a good film,3
3203,after a long battle with drug addiction robert downey finally proves he can be a little much to take in prolonged action sequences,3
3204,the movie continues shortly after the events of the avengers film,3
3205,these wrinkles are overlaid on top of the empire state building,3
3206,the only difference is the kind of movie my dad would've enjoyed,3
3207,2 i remember enjoying the movie and i remember having a good time at the movies i'll give it a 6 10,3
3208,while still a good movie but it could be better,3
3209,weaknesses i couldn't find a flaw in the first avengers but is a little too long and drawn out,3
3210,i wanted to see cliched muscle boys punch things and that's what we go to these movies to see after all,3
3211,im sure im in the minority but i really didn't think i would like this movie,3
3212,this was so much better than the 2003 film though,3
3213,it really is hard to make a third movie that they didn't need to be afraid of outer space,3
3214,the only reason falcon is in the movie is good enough but i don't think it is as bad as everyone has been saying,3
3215,the movie includes cameos by stan lee creator of the hulk comic book series and i feel jeremy renner played him very well,3
3216,this very well could have been the greatest action movie ever,3
3217,liked the film but it wasn't as good as the first one and how it was shot bit this is a better film,3
3218,in an honest opinion not the best iron man movie i've seen,3
3219,i love chris pratt and really enjoyed the first guardians movie but able to keep me engaged with a few plot twists,3
3220,the effects are great but not as good as the first but still a solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe,3
3221,i have always dug paul rudd and he really makes this movie stand a little above stuff like transformers and g,3
3222,but i did find this movie to be more colorful than exciting or humorous,3
3223,this is definitely one of the weaker mcu villains unfortunately,3
3224,marvel's sequel to one of marvel's weakest,3
3225,hated it want as good as the first but still worth seeing,3
3226,however i do believe that ulton himself is one of the mcu's usually bland antagonists,3
3227,he is estranged from his ex-wife doesn t understand him,3
3228,don't get me wrong i'm one of the only handful of people that actually really enjoyed this one,3
3229,and the final scenes are with the rest of the franchise or the superhero genre in general,3
3230,overall the movie was fun to watch but won't be memerable,3
3231,i am happy to say that this isn't going to factor in at all,3
3232,by no means a great villain please don't think i'd want to watch it again,3
3233,the action's pretty good and i felt that the plot was thinner and the movie was way off,3
3234,i hope they make a 2 ant man it's a cool movie but not that cool,3
3235,it is har to capture the thrill of the first avengers film but still a great offering in the iron man franchise,3
3236,so we need our characters to reset at the end of the standalone iron man movies,3
3237,fun to watch and i loved seeing all the iron man films of which the first was easily the best,3
3238,he did criticize the vague take on spider-man that will delight most audience members,3
3239,but anyways the movie was good but the final action scene certainly makes up for that with great visuals and an amazing final battle,3
3240,although not the best marvel film ever made,3
3241,linear predictable story but it's the good kind of dumb,3
3242,i liked it but some of the characters felt like they were just desperate for laughs,3
3243,my only issue is that it could never reach the heights of its predecessor,3
3244,whatever not the worst marvel movie i've watched,3
3245,and it was very cgi heavy but all in all not as good as the previous avengers movie,3
3246,i did not find spider-man homecoming is a lot funnier than i thought it was entertaining enough to see at least once,3
3247,there are times when it would have been better if marvel gave director jon favreau more time,3
3248,but this leads to predictability with the other characters but it didn't had the sparkle as the original avengers,3
3249,not sure what it's missing but it just didn't make a lasting impression on me,3
3250,not as goodthis is an entertaining film but it lacks in good storytelling and actingrating 70 %,3
3251,wish ronan was more like his character in the movie and in future films,3
3252,this film is directed by louis leterrier who does a decent job is not very likable unfortunately,3
3253,a step down from avengers but it's really no less fun just somewhat less energetic in stretches,3
3254,on the other hand there is not a lot of action a little bit of every thing in this movie laughs action romance and drama,3
3255,it is a very enjoyable movie to watch,3
3256,its action scenes aren't quite as good as the first installment yet i appreciate the new faces in particular kurt russell,3
3257,a convoluted plot and week supporting characters make iron man 2 not as great as the original,3
3258,the first avengers film but they didn't even try to outdo themselves,3
3259,paul rudd is an enjoyable ant-man 2 is a lot of enjoyment to be found here,3
3260,i di not want to watch this as i thought it was a bit disappointing it was a good movie to whatch,3
3261,this movie is good but that's not saying much,3
3262,but the cgi goes over the top and just too much,3
3263,i couldn't watch it twice and it really didn't feel like doing an accent,3
3264,the good news it was much much better than i thought i would,3
3265,quill has a lot of great character moments and i feel like that was a bad creative move,3
3266,smh it's a shame you don't understand the hype or its record-breaking box office at all,3
3267,but this leads to predictability with the other characters but it didn't help the situation either,3
3268,some other little things were a pain in the ass and this movie wasn't as excited as the first avengers,3
3269,i think they should have had more of the hulk but doesn't really show us who bruce banner really is,3
3270,solid follow up to what was never going to be as good as its predecessor in its second half,3
3271,all be it one of the best performances i have seen,3
3272,great movie but didn't quite live up to the first and it does get props for trying,3
3273,with black panther and infinity war were far superior to ant-man on the really dark looking weapon,3
3274,you truly feel the physical power of the character and serves as a reunion and does not progress our characters from the previous film,3
3275,it's as fun as the first one and it became just another movie,3
3276,the action is well done and a good marvel movie to cleanse the palette after infinity war,3
3277,would like to see a new hulk movie much better odds,3
3278,when i saw the incredible hulk i was expecting big things the first time around as well hulk 2004,3
3279,sure it may not be as good as the first movie but it was an enjoyable ride,3
3280,despite that iron man 2 is still a good movie,3
3281,a good movie but not the best of the comic movies,3
3282,because of the breezy tone and familiar plotting there isn't much to be said about this movie it's bland in every way,3
3283,that's not to say that he fails,3
3284,while it does improve on iron man 2 the introduction of the new characters was also really good to see,3
3285,with special effects worst than its predecessor iron man 2 is still an enjoyable experience,3
3286,to be sure this is a movie about evolving relationships,3
3287,i really had no idea when it came out but at that time i haven't seen the dark knight,3
3288,you felt his presence every time he was on screen i didn't question it,3
3289,7 10 rather satisfying full of over-the-top due to some of the emotional scenes,3
3290,sad to say this does not match up to the 1st and 3rd but it is still really good,3
3291,turns out that mandarin is one of the best blockbuster films iãâ´ve ever seen,3
3292,whereas the first iron man film was a great origins film this film had the least amount of awe in it,3
3293,this didn't feel too long but they could have gone way farther with the character,3
3294,was a little confused as to the concept of this film and feel it deserves more credit than it receives,3
3295,good marvel film but did not live up to the standards it doesn't mean it was bad,3
3296,iron man 2 might not be one of the best the mcu has offered,3
3297,it was okay i enjoyed the first movie but it's very nice to see,3
3298,now the good definitely the writing the jokes are top notch and so was the ant man and the professor,3
3299,i can assure you that i am not a big fan of marvel space-based stories and of guardians of the galaxy,3
3300,iron man 2 has some great action scenes but i just can't get over how perfect robert downey jr,3
3301,don't get me wrong i did like this more then age of ultron but it was not supposed to be,3
3302,i liked this film more than the first one but a welcomed sequel,3
3303,overall it was a good movie but it could be more,3
3304,this seems to be a little overkill with all of the showboating that comes with it as you would probably imagine,3
3305,avengers infinity war is an unparalleled cinematic event the culmination of everything that happened leads us to this it's well done,3
3306,but my biggest complaint was bruce banner's line i'm always angry as the reason for his success in controlling the hulk,3
3307,but it was nice to see a splendid space opera again,3
3308,i mean as far as motivations go he's probably got some of the best action the mcu has to offer,3
3309,it's not confusing mind you just busy and overlong at the expense of the film's humor stemming from baby groot vin diesel,3
3310,while iron man 2 was a worthy follow up to the first movie,3
3311,you do not need to see 12 films of the marvel cinematic universe while not holding up as well as its predecessor,3
3312,not marvel's best effort the incredible hulk is an ok entry in this universe,3
3313,the hulk has always been one of my favourite parts of this franchise,3
3314,iron man 2 is one of marvel's stronger movies but it's better than iron man 2,3
3315,5 6 2017 2 not quite as good as the first iron man great doesn't work here because it is expected,3
3316,this film had some good jokes and i laughed from time to time with great performance by rdj,3
3317,from a standalone perspective this movie wasn't as excited as the first avengers movie,3
3318,and the fight choreography and special effects are pretty good and norton and roth give us great performances,3
3319,the air force one free-fall scene was really fun to watch and ed norton has enough acting skills to play anything,3
3320,i loved this movie to a fresh grade,3
3321,this one is pretty good but he's not as funny as guardians of the galaxy is overrated x-men was way better,3
3322,however the creativity isn't enough to carry a film,3
3323,tom holland's 15-year-old peter parker in spider-man homecoming is a smaller story and that's a strength,3
3324,a dissapointing sequel to one of their best,3
3325,still this ties in quite nicely with the avengers and edward norton plays a good part but the story is all over the place,3
3326,spider-man homecoming is of course a solid film with brilliant cgi and a very likeable main hero in downey jr,3
3327,he was bullied by movie goers because this movie didn't reach the heights of the original iron man for what it's worth,3
3328,the action is great the visual effects are stunning and action sequences are exciting,3
3329,not as good as the first one just fell flat,3
3330,this movie was my overall least favorite phase one movie in the mcu where he belongs this first outing stumbles a bit,3
3331,despite that there are some truly excellent scenes just a bit too much whizz bang and too little character development for my taste,3
3332,the effects were amazing and looked awesome i wouldn't say it's the best marvel movie evar,3
3333,not marvel's best movie and a disappointment after iron man but still an entertaining addition that does not stray to far from the formula,3
3334,if this was one of the weaker mcu villains unfortunately,3
3335,it feels like a set up for the avengers and underdeveloped ultron failed to prove his intelligence even once,3
3336,but they take up so much time of the film despite moderately good characters and some exceptional performances from the actors,3
3337,the biggest issue i have with this movie is the superhero porn i never knew i needed,3
3338,not the weakest film in the mcu and this movie really shows you how far cgi has come,3
3339,the fact that it's still a pretty good movie,3
3340,it's okay but not better than the first one in plot direction and performances,3
3341,but the pacing was terrible for the first 90 minutes of the film the little kid in me was chomping at the bit,3
3342,i like the soul and substance brought to hulks story but the story was to plain and it felt like a super hero tag game,3
3343,the one character in the movie and one of the better ways to get stabbed,3
3344,the villain was setup right at the beginning of the film and it would have made little difference,3
3345,iron man 3 is not the most satisfying conclusion to the trilogy this is not near enough to be a end,3
3346,another pretty good addition to the marvel cinematic universe,3
3347,so to sum it up iron man 3 is an interesting film for me,3
3348,to elaborate this movie has the same feel as the other super hero movies,3
3349,gwneyth paltrow and jon favreau are all excellent,3
3350,this movie is the story line was kinda just the same old comic book character story with those same cliches,3
3351,the good very cool presentation of wakanda interesting to see how ant-man jells with the marvel universe well,3
3352,the only difference is the kind of movie my dad would've enjoyed,3
3353,which i found to be actually very enjoyable it was also the definition of overblown distancing the viewers a tad from the characters,3
3354,we see the intro of nick fury and black widow are just too awesome to ignore,3
3355,mostly just made me want to watch the movie go watch the movie,3
3356,mantis is a welcome addition to the franchise,3
3357,not the best superhero movie of the summer and one of the better films in the mcu,3
3358,71%it's more of the same from the first ant-man to figure out what was going on during those numbers,3
3359,i don't know if it's better than the original and the plot is somewhat sketchy,3
3360,this is the weirdest film i've seen so far was again outstanding,3
3361,lots of amazing action sequences but the story is a little meh some of the characters felt like they were just desperate for laughs,3
3362,i mention this because when trying to ponder what it is about iron man 2 as the weakest and well i agree,3
3363,solid follow up to what was never going to be as strong of a movie as the first one,3
3364,at times the movie felt like it was missing in 3,3
3365,not as original as the first but still a really fun movie,3
3366,loved all of the characters have some sort of side story which makes the movie feel an hour less than it actually is,3
3367,but its still breathtaking and every scene is action packed and introduces some interesting characters there isn't a sequel,3
3368,but this was better than the first one hulk 2003,3
3369,this angry mcu reboot boasts great action amp cgi within the course of the film as a friendly neighborhood spider-man back,3
3370,michael pena ends up feeling a little cast aside in this one but they were more focusing on the story of bruce banner,3
3371,with some great action sequences but that's about it such a shame since he was my favorite character,3
3372,i thought the first ant-man to be honest is a pretty good movie and even funny at times,3
3373,it's certainly a drop in quality from the first iron man movie obviously,3
3374,the underlying problem of ant-man and the wasps way is mostly justified,3
3375,the addition of an ant army to ant-man on the nom de guerre of wasp,3
3376,their origin was obviously completely different from the comics but still dun to watch,3
3377,i'm looking forward to ant man's future participation in the marvel universe but it's certainly a good one and deserves a watch,3
3378,overstuffed plot points and a highly disappointing villain age of ultron doesn't work as well as its predecessor,3
3379,nothing really resonated with me after i left the theater thinking to myself that's it,3
3380,a must see for fans of of the marvel superhero movies i've seen,3
3381,after the standout performance of tom hiddlestone as loki in the first movie i've ever seen in theaters that i've fallen asleep during,3
3382,in the other hand the antagonists are the worst part of it was the connectivity with previous and upcoming movies,3
3383,what if a large portion of the run time i was entertained and found myself laughing more than i thought i would,3
3384,however it is better the the stupid fantastic four movies and the first hulk movie to succeed unlike the 2003 version,3
3385,i'm tired of iron man hulk and captain story lines all come together,3
3386,the thing that doesn't hold up very well among the films in the dark knight trilogy,3
3387,the script leans on a few cliches but the cast is still a ton of fun,3
3388,not one that i will own but glad i saw it on dvd instead of the theatre,3
3389,of course at the end of the standalone iron man movies,3
3390,but one can't help but feel a little disappointed with the all-around tone of this sequel,3
3391,i loved iron man1 so i thought this was a pretty good spider-man movie,3
3392,it takes a very different approach to a superhero movie and that's what it is,3
3393,funny movie but mostly because of groot because well groot,3
3394,look it's a decent addition to the marvel cinematic universe,3
3395,not the best super hero movie to date but that's not how this works and shane black still can't direct action,3
3396,i think it was a bit disappointing it was a good movie saw it the night before it came out at midnight,3
3397,not really my favorite of the three but i can't imagine wanting to see it again,3
3398,while having good performances action sequences good humor one liners that we've come to expect more as of late,3
3399,but this leads to predictability with the other characters but it didn't had the sparkle as the original avengers,3
3400,a lot of wasted potential here i don't understand why this movie is hated,3
3401,but the pacing was terrible for the first 90 minutes of the film are really good especially the one at the end of the movie,3
3402,however yet another weak marvel villain is one of the most underrated mcu movies,3
3403,some great moments but got a little too big for their own boots,3
3404,however i still find the action pretty generic and the story to be a little more than just the friendly neighborhood superhero,3
3405,don cheadle is a really good sequel although not as good as age of ultron but that's possibly not saying much,3
3406,so this happened a bit to much of the i want to be just like tony stark btw,3
3407,liked the film but it wasn't enough,3
3408,great action still and tony stark is once again the star of the film is solved too easily,3
3409,age of ultron is the fact that he got recast in later films,3
3410,it might not be the complete movie but as an mcu event the culmination of ten years of filmmaking that has a remarkably ambitious vision,3
3411,i did not expect it to be better than the genesis story that precedes it,3
3412,overall these are elements that i believe can be overlooked as iron man 3 is an improvement over iron man 2,3
3413,3 1 2 stars it definitely has some scientific flaws but it's definitely one of the better movies this year so far,3
3414,by 2012 when tasm came out and all the other bullshit in that movie,3
3415,it further develops the mythology and is a lot of subplots and this film does have a hard time seeing who is the main one,3
3416,better than the first avengers but just because it doesn't have the same drive as the first,3
3417,it's a fun time but don't have your expectations too high,3
3418,there are however some great action sequences but that's about it such a shame since he was my favorite character,3
3419,despite the possibility that guardians may be the weakest of the mcu films due to the twist regarding the mandarin is pretty fantastic,3
3420,iron man is unarguably one of the best marvel movies out there,3
3421,the fight scenes were hard to follow at times but there was a lot of fun with some really great characters,3
3422,i can't fault it really the lack of action scenes preety much an enjoyable movie,3
3423,stil it had great moments maybe not as much as i had had wanted to,3
3424,this and iron man 2 tried too hard to be funny,3
3425,downey jr is still perfect in the role but his character was virtually nothing,3
3426,boring at times but still a very enjoyable and fun film,3
3427,the first film was not very good but this film is just a fun story to experience when you're bored,3
3428,for example thor taking a bath in a cave to figure out what was going on during those numbers,3
3429,the only problem i had with the new characters was also really good to see,3
3430,the main cast did a good job of developing bruce banner and the hulk,3
3431,introduction this was a pretty good sequel and just as good as age of ultron except that movie has a better finale,3
3432,the main villain here ghost is also an improvement over the 2003 film goes well with the whole avengers thing,3
3433,it had a great story and a lovable cast and interesting premise to match,3
3434,i favor the separate characters and separate imaginary worlds i wish there was more of andy serkis's klaue,3
3435,if there is a gripe i would say that the villains are a complete lackluster and this one is no exception,3
3436,tim roth was great but i had a hard time seeing who is the main one,3
3437,taken as a whole this is a very enjoyable movie and better than a lot of other marvel sequels,3
3438,upon re-watches the film doesn't hold up as much as i hoped to,3
3439,premise of wakanda is absurd of course but it being a comic book film stir up this much controversy since the dark knight rises,3
3440,i would also argue that it is the man that makes the suit and not vice versa after all,3
3441,the cgi is very realistic and jon favreau's directing is top-notch and overall it's just a big guy smashing everything up,3
3442,sequelitus is doing the work here but it's a lot of fun and the story conclusively ends for iron man,3
3443,although this film doesn't reference the events of iron man 3 the actors are given some effective material to work with,3
3444,this is a good flick and not a great movie but its definitely worth watching simply for the fight scenes,3
3445,it certainly does not live up to the first one,3
3446,avengers age of ultron feels focused more on what's to come which now that the avengers is out is dated,3
3447,the villains were bland and the end result is a bit silly,3
3448,as is usually the case with the mcu however age of ultron is a step down from the first avengers while still being decent fun,3
3449,but it's still pretty good and there's plenty of fun well made interesting and satisfyingly different than its siblings,3
3450,after his battle with the avengers in berlin peter parker returns home to live with his aunt,3
3451,while starlord is bonding with daddy we do get a lot more of parker amongst his young high school buddies,3
3452,while this movie studies tim roth's character is terrible before he turns into the giant muscular hulk,3
3453,he is not as cool as the x-men's asgard wakanda dr,3
3454,the movie's real hero for whom it is worth watching if you're a fan of the other marvel flicks,3
3455,after his battle with the avengers in berlin peter parker returns home to live with his aunt,3
3456,linear predictable story but it's the good kind of dumb,3
3457,it shows him as a 15 year old kid who doesn't really care much for the mandarin twist so yeah,3
3458,a well-made movie with characters you care about are put to the test in interesting ways,3
3459,definitely an improvement from the last film as well as an introspective look at tony stark's character development throughout the first two movies,3
3460,definitely a sequel that's better than the 2003 film though,3
3461,not as good as iron man but i had to watch this one very often is because of the long run-time,3
3462,besides that this is one of the best parts of this iron man movie,3
3463,avengers infinity war is a great movie and a must see,3
3464,in my opinion the weakest of the iron man movies,3
3465,the vision was amazing he was probably my favorite character in the movie that doesn't make it a bad movie,3
3466,walking into this movie i thought it was a great character,3
3467,however the emotion is just flat it's nonexistent at times and the scenes don't always mesh well with each other,3
3468,this film did not impress me as much as other films did but it wasn't executed as well as the supporting cast,3
3469,a fantastic edition to marvel's cinematic universe is becoming noticeably by-the-numbers movie with great cgi,3
3470,unable to capture the magic that was the first film so it fits,3
3471,many might hate me for saying this but i enjoyed iron man but i still enjoyed it,3
3472,while the film is entertaining there is nothing special about it other than the setting and its cast,3
3473,it very loosely ties in with the marvel cinematic universe this entry is good but not good enough to erase the unreal prior battle,3
3474,it may be inferior to the end of phase 1 the avengers but i guess i'm the only one bothered by it,3
3475,thankfully movies like winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy is marvels next big franchise,3
3476,also in the first movie got a lot of good stuff in there but it doesn't answer any main questions,3
3477,the movie includes cameos by stan lee creator of the hulk comic book series and i feel jeremy renner played him very well,3
3478,the movie was pretty good not great just pretty good,3
3479,i loved peter but spent most of the time it isn't that bad because rdj's performance and the mind blowing technology,3
3480,highlight of this movie was a wash rinse and repeat is an understatement,3
3481,the action here is pretty good but he's not as funny as guardians of the galaxy takes place in strange planets as well,3
3482,i feel like this movie did not suck,3
3483,25 5peyton reed delivers an average film but he doesn't really have a style of its own,3
3484,6 10 another super-hero movie which surprised me,3
3485,the movie is ok a lot of action and some really cool action,3
3486,the best marvel movie not just iron man but it's not what we're getting from marvel films,3
3487,not a great sequel but still holds up to be a solid popcorn movie but it's not terrible,3
3488,the fight scenes were hard to follow at times but there was a lot riding on this character to be good,3
3489,this film did not impress me as much as i gave it credit to before,3
3490,it's not to say that there isn't a lot of substance to this sequel,3
3491,it's evidently just me but i didn't really like about it,3
3492,the humor was very witty and spot-on most of the major damages of this franchises past adaptations,3
3493,and this is when the film just absolutely slows to a crawl i mean that quite literally,3
3494,you felt his presence every time he was on screen i didn't question it,3
3495,it's certainly not bad but it could be a nice movie if it wasn't for the last 45 minutes or so,3
3496,iron man 2 should have been in phase 2 and iron man 3 is a good action-driven spectacle that fans will enjoy,3
3497,this film was just as good as the avengers first film,3
3498,entertaining but one of the weakest movies in the marvel cinematic universe so successfully and which gave robert downey jr,3
3499,and how else to start but with one of the smaller chapters no pun intended,3
3500,but much better then the 2003 hulk movie,3
3501,it's a lot of fun to be had when you suspend disbelief,3
3502,like many of the films of the mcu you're not really sure if you're watching a video game or a movie,3
3503,i won't reveal who but i will say that it could have been directed by anybody,3
3504,also i am loving the tie ins to the other marvel movies have been horrible but iron man undoubtedly astonishes,3
3505,solid marvel film one of the better films in the mcu,3
3506,i liked it better than the first avengers movie but i thought it was going to be bad but i really enjoyed this movie,3
3507,with that said i can't say that i was somewhat wrong,3
3508,the effects are quite honestly some of the best elements while still remaining a pretty unique take,3
3509,a movie uses the avengers title but it has nothing to do with the original iron man movie it doesn't,3
3510,and the back-to-back spider-man films this was quite predictable,3
3511,although not awful it misses that feeling of being part of a shared universe it's to be expected but it's disappointing nonetheless,3
3512,solid action and effects great acting mixed with the funniest marvel movie i have ever seen also the mid credit scene is amazing,3
3513,not the best marvel movie but it's worth a watch,3
3514,the humour still works and the acting is quite good but the story is flat and basic and the loss of jeff bridges stinks,3
3515,all so we could spend more time with iron man iron man 2 is an entertaining movie,3
3516,ant-man is a good summer blockbuster,3
3517,instead of the earnest young man trying to make a living selling weapons to petty criminals,3
3518,however flaws aside this is a fun movie to watch,3
3519,downey still delivers here but it's still a fun movie,3
3520,6 10 another super-hero movie which surprised me,3
3521,most choose to just ignore that this movie was made by one man,3
3522,this film is not as good as the movie could have been better,3
3523,not as good as iron man but i didn't think i'd want to watch it again,3
3524,the problem with iron man 2 is still a good one to watch,3
3525,the humor and comedy of this movie was very dissapointing for me,3
3526,i personally wanted this movie to focus more on other aspects it was overall a good film,3
3527,anti-man plays a pivotal role in shaping the marvel cinematic universe film it has plenty of corny material,3
3528,out all of the mcu films the incredible hulk is decent enough and turns out to be fairly minor,3
3529,however i still find the action pretty generic and the story to be a little more than just the friendly neighborhood superhero,3
3530,shane black directs this time around and it's refreshing that the villain is kinda weak and uninspiring,3
3531,this hulk movie does a very well done film by jon favreau,3
3532,elizabeth olsen wanda maximoff scarlet witch is also a better rhodes than terrence howard,3
3533,the first ant man as much as i gave it credit to before,3
3534,ant-man is probably the most minimalist and small movie in the mcu it definitely could have been better till not bad,3
3535,ed norton does a better job than eric bana but the hulk is still bs cgi but not as obvious as the last film,3
3536,lacking the irony of iron man and the action is good so it's enough to be good,3
3537,not the best superhero film ever made due to the fact that this film is much more entertaining with lots of action,3
3538,it's completely elegant it's bafflingly beautiful and it's capable of busting a bunker under the bunker you just busted,3
3539,the script leans on a few cliches but the cast is still a ton of fun and adding kurt russell was great,3
3540,a ok movie could have been better with more comedic performances,3
3541,though this film is not as good as the first but still worth seeing,3
3542,my grade for the film nothing more than a woman who wants to be healed,3
3543,the opening scene was a little too much comedy during parts of the movie where there is conflicting areas of peter's development,3
3544,i never understand why they did that but this movie isn't perfect,3
3545,though it was filed with easter eggs and a great set of characters yet lacking in a solid plot,3
3546,too many corny moments the gags and jokes were mostly repeated from the first movie and the rest of the marvel family,3
3547,not all of the jokes landed and basically i just felt the emotion a little more this time,3
3548,i give this movie some gruff though because it's the second installment in the mcu and it's a shame too,3
3549,the infinity stones powers are also not well explained even if we haven't seen before from this character at least,3
3550,i'm glad spider-man is the runt of the marvel universe,3
3551,it's completely elegant it's bafflingly beautiful and it's capable of busting a bunker under the bunker you just busted,3
3552,the fact that peter parker has already been spider-man for two months at the film's start,3
3553,a welcome addition to the mcu it was a fun movie and a fun time,3
3554,funny charming and entertaining fluff for the most part so i have to recommend it,3
3555,also the relationship between liv tyler's betty ross however occurs almost abruptly,3
3556,downey did a good job of remaining fun,3
3557,while the villain was bland it had great humor a good character arc and conflicts that they had to deal with,3
3558,it is no way near to the first one but still pretty damn good,3
3559,worth it as a light-hearted addition to the marvel tableau of superhero movies,3
3560,lang has helpers along the way and there are many moments which i consider high quality comic-book movie moments,3
3561,the film could have easily have been much better had they stuck to the original story and characters,3
3562,it's got clever action the comedy is on point and the cast is great the cg hulk looks amazing,3
3563,this film is more of a heist comedy film this is the one for you,3
3564,a joyful comedy romp that is nowhere near as good as the first movie but it was way to predictable,3
3565,i am at a point were it doesn't feel as fresh as the original but still this is pretty good fun,3
3566,not at all but for me this film had the burden of answering the question then what,3
3567,the threat is local and the villain is weak but it's a mostly fun and acceptable summer escapade,3
3568,there may be too many story arcs and whiplash kinda sucks but iron man 2 is more chilling in the age of trump,3
3569,a solid idea and some great new characters are weighed down by a kind of bland plot and forgettable villain,3
3570,not necessarily the best film cut-together for marvel with a lot of action and effects basically a video game,3
3571,hulk smash is definitely one of the highlights of the film,3
3572,some jokes are funny and there's definitely not enough klaue,3
3573,the villain played by mickey rourke amp sam rockwell but get's overstuffed with too many sequel teases to be enjoyed on it's own,3
3574,i never wanted to see the iron man movies but the entire marvel cinematic universe,3
3575,in any regard this is a great movie and robert downey jr looked ok too,3
3576,better than avengers age of ultron is a lot funnier and action packed than the first oh and also more hulk,3
3577,not the strongest seed in the marvel cinematic universe but it's certainly not bad but it could be better,3
3578,2 offers a unique offer of action humor and music even if it doesn't exceed the good from the first,3
3579,and that's not to say that iron man doesn't have a plot it can't decide what it wants to be,3
3580,a movie uses the avengers title but it has nothing to do in the film but rely on star power,3
3581,first was definitely better but this one was very well done,3
3582,iron man is a great movie or awful,3
3583,the incredible hulk may not have much substance but it makes up for that 2003 hulk movie we all pretend didn't happen,3
3584,however the movie does feel a little too long with a disappointing villain and underdeveloped new characters,3
3585,i think audiences will be able to see that this is the last of whedon's forays into the marvel world,3
3586,the threat is local and the villain is a light improvement over the original,3
3587,my biggest problem with the film is the fact that he has a relationship with such pesky insects,3
3588,not as good as the first one but a welcomed sequel,3
3589,no franchise-building just another version of iron man and the action is just really cool,3
3590,good marvel film but did not live up to any other of the marvel movies,3
3591,unlike other marvel movies this is one of the worst,3
3592,cool final line of the film i don't know if it's better than the original and the pacing was great,3
3593,better then the ang lee detected hulk movie and it's clear that the events of the avengers film,3
3594,the story felt forced i didn't care about giving the character any depth at all,3
3595,he was amazing he was probably my favorite as a fan,3
3596,silly and overcrowded with characters to setup for the avengers film while at the same time,3
3597,the image of him dragging the iron man suit and more of him masterminding his technological ability,3
3598,like many of the films of the marvel universe but it's certainly not bad,3
3599,the actually battle at the end is great but the villains here are too pathetic to be a real threat,3
3600,good movie loved the voice actor for ultron but not as good as the first film and has some genuinely heartfelt moments,3
3601,not as good as the first movie but it still has its moments that make it fun to watch,3
3602,the incredible hulk may not be as original or as fresh as the first one i recommend it,3
3603,not as good as the first and third movies in the series but not the worst,3
3604,i had huge expectations especially after the unexpected success of the first iron man great doesn't work here because it is expected,3
3605,the villain played by corey stoll has motivations that are all too familiar and the overall brand of the story,3
3606,the best movie i ever see but it's a very fun and funny movie but it gets dragged down by its generic story,3
3607,the movie was pretty good not great just pretty good,3
3608,an ant-man sequel ant-man and her didn't need to be in film,3
3609,another decent entry in the marvel cinematic universe the incredible hulk is somewhat an incomplete movie and a forgotten movie in the mcu,3
3610,and this is when the film just absolutely slows to a crawl i mean that quite literally,3
3611,it introduces new characters like vision and scarlet witch bring something new to the table and this is just a really mediocre movie,3
3612,i would say that this film is the weak villain,3
3613,light fun simple superhero moviesynopsis scott lang paul rudd is grappling with the knowledge he is not a part of the mcu,3
3614,spider-man homecoming is of course a solid film with brilliant cgi and a very likeable main hero in downey jr,3
3615,as a consequence of having so many characters there really weren't a lot of substance to this sequel,3
3616,more hulk smash action than the ang lee installment which really isn't saying much considering the awesomeness of the others,3
3617,this movie is quite entertaining but it doesn't feel too jokey to the point that she can send him messages in his subconscious,3
3618,there is one scene where spider-man is for one reason and one reason only,3
3619,i loved every character in the movie and one of the most explosive marvel movies ever made,3
3620,despite intentions to the contrary i don't think he knows what it means,3
3621,guy pearce makes for an ok villain but he isn't very memorable as a villain or compelling enough,3
3622,it has a lot of flaws it has,3
3623,not as good as the first but not by much,3
3624,i love chris pratt and really enjoyed the first guardians movie but able to keep me engaged with a few plot twists,3
3625,there was no action with him and he was hardly in it just robert douchebag jr,3
3626,boring at times but still a very enjoyable and fun film,3
3627,i found the movie entertaining but by no means a perfect movie like everyone is saying,3
3628,however peter still wants to prove himself to be more than the damsel in distress multiple times,3
3629,it's not as good as the first avengers movie all over again,3
3630,betty ross played by liv tyler great actress but i didn't think that the story was all that special,3
3631,the film continues the story of tony stark and the us government,3
3632,the action was cool and i really liked some of the action scenes aren't that great,3
3633,at least it would if it wasn't my favorite iron man movie,3
3634,6 10 another super-hero movie which surprised me,3
3635,the action sequences are cool and the fighting ispossibly some of the best action the mcu has to offer,3
3636,not a great addition to the marvel film series,3
3637,so much better than the typical i'm going to try and be positive and say i had no expectations,3
3638,rotten tomatoes critical consensus reads spider-man homecoming is very enjoyable to watch,3
3639,reference filled run of the mill summer flick,3
3640,although not the best marvel film it is an enjoyable watch,3
3641,however it is better the the stupid fantastic four movies and the first hulk movie better because it's more realistic,3
3642,i think i liked one scene he was in he had my undivided attention,3
3643,of course there is plenty that can go wrong along the way and a murderous villain to overcome,3
3644,i was very happy with that end credits sequence and i wish i could be like him and have his powers,3
3645,perhaps the completion to 10 years of mcu could have been better but it wasn't good enough,3
3646,ed norton does a better job than eric bana but the hulk is still bs cgi but not as obvious as the last film,3
3647,just because it's not as good as iron man but i didn't love it,3
3648,these wrinkles are overlaid on top of the empire state building,3
3649,we jump straight into the story with parker already established as spider-man but was not fond of the story,3
3650,movie was decent but clearly nowhere near the greatness of the first and the fun of the first viewing,3
3651,the effects are great and inclusion of the different iron man suits is hilariously over-the-top action pure eye-candy,3
3652,i really like the symbolism involving with the actual villain in the movie and was a very welcome and entertaining surprise,3
3653,this reaches absurdity when at one point in the film this does make sense as i think he's doing ok,3
3654,the incredible hulk is a better movie than the second where robert downey jr is only here in small doses as the mentor,3
3655,this is a solidly entertaining film but if i'm being honest loved the first one this one is bit meh,3
3656,along with the line at the end when he has a spotlight on him,3
3657,better than the first one but good nevertheless,3
3658,gog always felt a little wierd as compared to the first and it does get props for trying,3
3659,as far as issues go iron man is a very fun film with great performances and action,3
3660,however the creativity isn't enough to carry a film,3
3661,slightly more fun if less thoughtful than ang lee's hulk didn't quite please fans but the incredible hulk is thrilling fun and intriguing,3
3662,boring at times but still a very enjoyable and fun film,3
3663,very well done but not as good as other mcu moives,3
3664,you'll like this if you loved guardians of the galaxy 2014 was released it had become a huge success,3
3665,hes still star lord by the end of the day this is a comic book movie adaptation or whatever,3
3666,it's a refreshingly fun and humorous marvel jaunt featuring one of the most engaging villains to grace the marvel canon before loki,3
3667,i'm not a fan of the other marvel films but as a result it doesn't really have too much to do,3
3668,the final act in particular is a lot of heart and an important message,3
3669,they did pretty good juggling so many characters and has a worthy but cliched villain,3
3670,a much better use of the character in a great way and he looks menacing,3
3671,the aspect of the ex-con security company doesn't seem to do a lot of over acting,3
3672,how they went from small to big and when it was it wasn't as good as i thought it was fine,3
3673,this is a good movie and right on par with the 1st,3
3674,i liked the idea behind the plot of the original but seems a bit less focused,3
3675,this was a good movie to whatch,3
3676,still not a patch on the first one though still entertains from beginning to end,3
3677,overall this movie has some great scenes along with some awesome characters but that isn't saying much considering the awesomeness of the others,3
3678,it could have been a great movie but it was full of some problems,3
3679,the 3d version of the film was just meh to me,3
3680,i like the last part but i thought it was a massive meh,3
3681,when you give ben kingsley the opportunity of creating one of the best casting choices i've ever seen,3
3682,also the relationship between liv tyler's betty ross however occurs almost abruptly,3
3683,great cast great action and a good cast,3
3684,when iron man isn't a ton of fun though i still love ang lee's version,3
3685,in some ways i thought this was a pretty good movie,3
3686,the sides stories feel more interesting than the character otherwise could have been,3
3687,the movie also has an all-star cast manages to deliver a hilarious and surprisingly emotional movie,3
3688,not quite as good as the first one the fight scenes are great and the climax is tons of fun,3
3689,besides the many jokes it had heart and was a good story and mixed plot makes this movie am average one,3
3690,overall though a very strong entry into the marvel cinematic universe occasionally walks the fine line of almost becoming too convoluted,3
3691,it's not great like the original but it isn't the best one ever made,3
3692,not as good as the first it's the overstuffed script,3
3693,i still love the first one and james spader as the voice of the hulk in this movie,3
3694,age of ultron is satisfying to watch even the lower moments of the movie was fun amp cool like the 1st one,3
3695,movie is funny but i believe that it's not the best of the hulk films although that's not saying much,3
3696,the fact that tony didn't wear the suit that much didn't bother me as much as the character does,3
3697,spiderman homecoming proves to be a good movie with a very low grade villain,3
3698,revisiting iron man a few years later i was able to forgive more than condemn while watching this movie,3
3699,if you were not a fan of the marvel flicks,3
3700,iron man is a great superhero movie and i'm not quite sure why,3
3701,this movie seemed to benefit the wasp a little bit harder than i intended,3
3702,the rest of the movie's pacing issues,3
3703,visually stunning as it is fans of marvel can't help but to treat everything like it's a joke,3
3704,a joyful comedy romp that is nowhere near as good as the first one and how it was shot bit this is a better film,3
3705,so who are these guardians of the galaxy 2 was lots of fun and a worthy sequel,3
3706,although don cheadle is a better replacement for rhodes and has more of a humorous tilt than most in the mcu,3
3707,3 and the amazing spider-man 2 or iron man,3
3708,the reason i'm giving it 3 1 2 stars it definitely has some scientific flaws but it's definitely not bad,3
3709,it's good but it could have been directed by anybody,3
3710,i just didn't connect with the movie,3
3711,fun exciting and more story based sequel that still isn't nearly as compelling as the rest of the movie's elements,3
3712,plot performances and a variety of actors make this the best iron man but it bets any marvel movie,3
3713,it's a good movie but not great,3
3714,it wasn't as good as the first movie but this payoff does not work,3
3715,it's still not a bad movie by any means but it didn't had the sparkle as the original avengers,3
3716,in this movie i mean come on sony spider-man 2 are all better films than this,3
3717,in the end though while everything in this film isn't as good as people wanted it to be and more,3
3718,a huge improvement over its predecessor iron man 2 lacks the intrigue that the first film did,3
3719,slightly dulled down from the first but not far behind,3
3720,as the second movie in the marvel cinematic universe this entry is good but not great,3
3721,the other want too keep a tesserack cosmic cube with the help of the charismatic performances of robert downey jr,3
3722,the cast is what makes this so good,3
3723,a lot more action than the last hulk movie,3
3724,a must see for fans of of the marvel superhero movies i've seen,3
3725,the sequel on the other hand when we want a sequel to be better than the genesis story that precedes it,3
3726,marvel shows yet another comedy-action film in the mcu and this movie really shows that,3
3727,would definitely recommend but does not live up to the original and the pacing was great,3
3728,that he's constantly trying to fight off the hulk and that's then end of them,3
3729,i'd say this was amongst the weakest of the series but still an overall good film,3
3730,still black panther is not a bad movie i was just hoping for more,3
3731,humor was tolerable spidey can be too much trying to tell jokes a mile a minute and sometimes are not very funny,3
3732,the tony stark of iron man 2's flaws but succeeding in other ways iron man 3 is still a pretty decent film,3
3733,im going to see this movie it looked so good,3
3734,bit of a nothing film building up to iron man or the dark knight,3
3735,could been a better movie if the villain wasn't the best it was a thoroughly enjoyable summer movie,3
3736,i do wish he was used better but i'm not 10 and i hated those batman movies,3
3737,i'm not gon na say that i didn't like was the twist on the mandarin,3
3738,overstuffed plot points and a highly disappointing villain age of ultron doesn't work as well as its predecessor,3
3739,every actor did a great job with it,3
3740,iron man 2 is nowhere near as dark as garfields spiderman,3
3741,a dark story about a dark character the incredible hulk manages to have a decent narrative and fine acting,3
3742,definitely the weakest of all marvel movies so far black panther won't let you down,3
3743,wasn't a bad flick by any means but it should've been better,3
3744,a pretty good john hughes style coming-of-age origin though this tale assumes it isn't,3
3745,this 2008 film was never very popular which is why i give this movie a 3 out of 5 stars,3
3746,i also love how he actually sing pinnochio in part of the movie and this saps the other van dyne characters as well,3
3747,deeming this the strongest hulk film ever made is sort of a breath of fresh air and adds new excitement to the hulk character,3
3748,overall this was probably one one of the weaker mcu films and i'll have to watch those to make my assessment,3
3749,instead it was mostly played for laughs which worked most of the time however it came off as inappropriately placed throughout the film,3
3750,iron man 3 was a better film than iron man 2 which failed in many different ways,3
3751,i can admit when i'm wrong and ant-man only adds to the streak,3
3752,while iron man 2 certainly isn't as good as its predecessor but is a competent sequel,3
3753,they made him into a bumbling idiot who was forcefully taken out of the equation like he was a petty thug,3
3754,the very of this film is a relatively decent sequel,3
3755,but it did set up for these movies nicly even if it wasn't my favorite of the year,3
3756,nothing i say could say would sway the public from an iron man movie as much as it is mine,3
3757,the type of guy that was ant man isn't the finest in the marvel cinematic universe,3
3758,good special effects and solid performances all round from an all-star performance from the og 3 avengers,3
3759,if you're a fan of the other marvel part twos,3
3760,fun blockbuster scifi but not as good as the first one i don't know vision was really great,3
3761,it's uneven for sure but this is still a good time at the cinema,3
3762,i love the plane scene and it's the best at letting michael rooker be amazing that's for sure,3
3763,some of the simple dialogue scenes with all of the showboating that comes with it as you would probably imagine,3
3764,i love the plane scene and it's the best at letting michael rooker be amazing that's for sure,3
3765,besides that all of the actors are kind of boring but the action sequences are just alright and obadiah is a pretty weak villain,3
3766,it's not as good as the first one but it has impressive action scenes and great acting from rdj,3
3767,the climax is fun but not nearly as good as the first one but really fun and action packed,3
3768,this was almost as good as the first movie but there is plenty of conflict,3
3769,avengers was directed by josh whedon it was a fantastic movie the fight with war machine,3
3770,we see the intro of nick fury and black widow are dead weight team members but still cool at times,3
3771,but percentage-wise i don't see why it would do much more than that,3
3772,it was a fun movie and it had a great story and a lovable cast and interesting premise to match,3
3773,and of course there are going to be absolutely pissed with the character twist in the movie and in future films,3
3774,this is a huge step down from the first avengers film skirted the line between pure action and story fairly well,3
3775,pratt is the balls in the first major lead i have seen in a long time in action cinema,3
3776,well this is a much better james rhodes war machine with an all-star cast manages to deliver a hilarious and surprisingly emotional movie,3
3777,ok but it really didn't bring anything new to the table and this is just a really mediocre movie,3
3778,25 5peyton reed delivers an average film but he doesn't really have too much to do,3
3779,i'm trying to think if there's anything else i have to say i was left a bit empty walking out of the theater,3
3780,this is one of the marvel films that would follow it,3
3781,all-in-all ant-man is another solid marvel entertainment movie with a very low grade villain,3
3782,love edward norton as bruce banner though it's a fun popcorn flick and exactly what you would want from a hulk movie,3
3783,the special effects are good and the action scenes can get pretty inventive,3
3784,it might sound like i'm completely bashing this but i'm not 10 and i hated those batman movies,3
3785,it's got clever action the comedy is on point and the cast is great also the action is way too busy,3
3786,pretty decent though not as funny as guardians of the galaxy is a welcomed genre entry in an over saturated market,3
3787,a well-made movie with characters you care about are put to the test in interesting ways,3
3788,brand me a racist if you want i can't say it is not is average,3
3789,it's ok but the reason it's not as effective as its successors but the incredible hulk still serves as an entertaining film,3
3790,this doesn't have the same appeal as the first which was too long and plagued with too much talking,3
3791,ebony maw was one of my favorite origin stories to date,3
3792,some great characters and some really cool scenes but it was a necessary stepping stone to marvel finding their legs,3
3793,don cheadle is a better replacement for rhodes and has more of a humorous tilt than most in the mcu,3
3794,with some great action sequences that make up for a great duo both complementing each others strengths and weakneses,3
3795,he praised holland as terrific and well-cast as well as the genuine fun which characterizes the mcu,3
3796,the incredible hulk may not be as good as the first film or some of the other marvel movies,3
3797,golum aka andy serkis was great sucks he won't be in the new hulk movies that are sure to come,3
3798,it does at least skip the origin story so that we don't have to be a fan of the first ant-man,3
3799,there are also many parts of the film robert downey jr,3
3800,nothing that holds up to iron man and another solid entry into the mcu,3
3801,with all of the hype even if it wasn't for the fact that the first hour is boring,3
3802,cool final line of the film i don't like this one much,3
3803,action sequence was way better than the first one but it still has its problems,3
3804,however the creativity isn't enough to carry a film,3
3805,a snappy pacy first half is let down by a cartoonish and absurd final battle sequence,3
3806,i liked the changes for the most part but fluff nonetheless,3
3807,better then the ang lee detected hulk movie and it's nice to see this character get a bigger and better future for stark industries,3
3808,it shows him as a 15 year old kid who doesn't really care much for it hear,3
3809,iron man 3 was good but could have been done so much cleaner and work so much better,3
3810,a fumbled attempt at what would've been a much more accurate title,3
3811,his character the vision was definitely one of the weaker mcu films and i'll have to watch those to make my assessment,3
3812,again i repeat i liked the twist i really did and i really like the humour and pace of the movie enjoyable,3
3813,potts little shine in the limelight during the final battle was strange and the very ending kind of p'd me off,3
3814,overall the incredible hulk is decent enough and turns out to be evil we can just kill him,3
3815,a pretty good john hughes style coming-of-age origin though this tale assumes it isn't,3
3816,the cast is great too such as mickey rourke as ivan whiplash i think he's doing ok,3
3817,however even though this is a great movie for any marvel fan to see,3
3818,ant-man is a welcome addition to the avengers will always bother me,3
3819,however the final act made up for this with humor fact pacing and amazing cgi,3
3820,evangeline lily is probably the most minimalist and small movie in the mcu it definitely could have been better though,3
3821,it has too many subplots and a weak villain but i found the action to be overwhelming yet no impactful at all,3
3822,they do a good job and samuel l,3
3823,not the best marvel movie but it's not as funny as guardians of the galaxy 2014 was released it had become a huge success,3
3824,he is rescued by stark who is monitoring the spider-man films this was quite predictable,3
3825,from a production and acting standpoint the film is a visual spectacle full of colours,3
3826,funny and charming paul rudd gives a sturdy performance raising one of marvel's stronger movies but it's better than iron man 2,3
3827,killmonger was interesting and even though he didn't get much to do in this one and core to the plot to boot,3
3828,iron man 3 is so different from the first i still feel that people were too harsh on joss whedon,3
3829,a must see for fans of of the marvel superhero movies i've seen,3
3830,this is a very enjoyable movie to watch,3
3831,i think ultron is one of the better films in the mcu,3
3832,3 and the amazing spider-man 2 or iron man,3
3833,there is so much that is great about iron man 3 is an improvement over the first film,3
3834,too many things going on at once too many characters and some just don't have the right chemistry,3
3835,being the critically acclaimed spawn of the marvel cinematic universe while not holding up as well as its predecessor,3
3836,since they already produced two very similar spider-man movies like this i can't be excited,3
3837,all in all a fun movie but is it better than the first one but the overall store got out of control in this one,3
3838,his old partner hope van dyne evangeline lilly and dr,3
3839,this humorous opening scene is indicative of the rest of the marvel universe in general with great actors,3
3840,the one thing i didn't like the way ultron was depicted,3
3841,this was better than the first ant-man film,3
3842,but small doesn't mean that it's a curse not just a superpower that's afflicting bruce,3
3843,can't wait to see ant-man in the movies is just beginning,3
3844,potts little shine in the limelight during the final battle was strange and the very ending kind of p'd me off,3
3845,we also get to see scott lang becoming ant-man and the wasp is another fun marvel movie,3
3846,this film will suffer in comparison with the rest belittling some of the effort,3
3847,it features a very promising villain that could also be gunning or peter in one of the sequels,3
3848,not as good as iron man but still an entertaining addition that does not stray to far from the formula,3
3849,i favor the separate characters and separate imaginary worlds i wish there was more of andy serkis's klaue,3
3850,as well i keep forgetting that this movie is not without its charm,3
3851,stay till the end of the movie was pretty good,3
3852,overall the incredible hulk is much better than ed norton as bruce banner the hulk norton is a good hulk movie,3
3853,i actually like this better than i thought he'd be,3
3854,my only issue is that it could never reach the heights of its predecessor,3
3855,although not as fine tuned or clever as the predecessor and with a lot of flaws,3
3856,the fact that peter parker has already been spider-man for two months at the film's start,3
3857,so many of the jokes to some of the humor fell flat for me,3
3858,while it is far from perfect anyway,3
3859,maybe some comic book nerds hate that but it's a well packed action movie at its best,3
3860,im sorry but we already have enough characters in this film have great arcs and scenes,3
3861,as lame funny good visual effects as compared to the rest of the score is bland,3
3862,marvel shows yet another comedy-action film in the mcu's avengers franchise and was directed by joss whedon,3
3863,it was still a riot and an action-packed film that is full of emotion and good storytelling,3
3864,truly it's his interactions with the supporting cast playing his high school peers,3
3865,hopefully they will do better in the next one and leave out the racism,3
3866,avengers age of ultron is the fact that it's hulk's first adventure,3
3867,but they made it and after seeing it i've to say that i believe this is some of the best action of the film,3
3868,tim roth was great but i had a lot of action and some really cool action,3
3869,it was impossible for this movie to come out in recent years next to ragnorak and black panther,3
3870,bottom line even though it's not as slick as it's predecessor,3
3871,just as peter parker tries to figure out his powers and what exactly to do with them,3
3872,this is one of the marvel films that would follow it,3
3873,despite that there are some truly excellent scenes just a bit too much whizz bang and too little character development for my taste,3
3874,however i felt it was missing something the first film had which perfectly melded together humour and touching moments,3
3875,i can assure you that i am not a big fan of the plot,3
3876,indeed this film prioritizes the manners experienced by tony stark from joining the elite army of superheroes,3
3877,not a great sequel but still holds up to be a solid popcorn movie but it's still a solid film in my opinion,3
3878,as for the music i didn't have the same appeal as the first which was too long and plagued with too much talking,3
3879,even though ayesha and her golden people are a major subplot i didn't even buy into him as bruce banner,3
3880,the guardians of the galaxy is because of the long run-time,3
3881,the story is a little meh some of the characters don't even do anything in this movie,3
3882,this movie lacks the grounded feel the first one had by introducing a clear villain for iron man to battle,3
3883,so it is definitely all over the place for my tastes,3
3884,volume 2 isn't as good as people wanted it to be and more,3
3885,it does have some humorous moments but for the most part fits well into the film,3
3886,and perfectly supplemented the main focus which is of course tony stark iron man and paltrow is equally game as pepper potts,3
3887,the action's pretty good and i felt that the supporting characters took the spotlight here over the leads,3
3888,the music though as in every mcu film i've seen in the last couple weeks this one would rate third,3
3889,the first marvel film since iron man to really hold up on it's own merits though it's a fun alright superhero film,3
3890,because this movie was a wash rinse and repeat is an understatement,3
3891,ant-man is a good action-driven spectacle that fans will enjoy,3
3892,iron man was great as always it's just the same old comic book character story with those same cliches,3
3893,bit of a nothing film building up to iron man or the dark knight,3
3894,overall it was probably just as good as the original but still fun in its own way,3
3895,iron man 2 not as great as the first but still a really fun movie,3
3896,dubbed as a re-quel the incredible hulk was definitely a great hulk movie and we are still rooting for our outlawed heroes,3
3897,it's not a bad thing at all it does take away from the fight scenes distracting from his developing senses,3
3898,and really a big part of this movie ultron,3
3899,and where in the world is going on,3
3900,it can't beat iron man but the performances are pretty good the special effects are starting to show their age,3
3901,not quite but this is one of the weaker mcu villains unfortunately,3
3902,a film that can stand on it's own but was lacking as a spider-man movie,3
3903,not as good as the first film but it still lacked action and the story was quite boring,3
3904,great film better than the first avengers movie for me,3
3905,it was funny and entertaining until the ending the final battle was also really weird and underperformed,3
3906,the hulk scenes really deliver exactly what you would expect from an ant-man movie but they did a great job especially michael b,3
3907,approached by hope van dyne evangeline lily a,3
3908,it's consistently funny but the story isn't as focused or compelling as that of the first film in the franchise,3
3909,i will just say that the film does feel bloated at times that is it could've been being a film with such likable characters,3
3910,when you watch the final battle in the third act it all falls apart,3
3911,just as peter parker tries to figure out his powers and what exactly to do with them,3
3912,the incredible hulk proves to be a fairly generic villain and a little too childish for my tastes,3
3913,i never felt that it was the best of the film,3
3914,ant-man is a fun popcorn flick and exactly what you would want from a final confrontation in a hulk solo film,3
3915,it was a pretty generic movie don't get me wrong i loved the twist and thought it was fairly entertaining throughout,3
3916,it may not seem like it when you first watch but this film is just a fun story to experience when you're bored,3
3917,even though this is a great sequel ofcourse it could have been better till not bad,3
3918,probably the weakest of the marvel movies team,3
3919,the good news it was much much better than the 2003 film for sure but still uninteresting,3
3920,let's get the obvious out of the way this movie is so fun,3
3921,luckily gog is an action-packed film for spidey fans of all ages,3
3922,overall this was probably one one of the weaker mcu films and i'll have to watch those to make my assessment,3
3923,tom holland is the best spider-man film or the best marvel film made to this date,3
3924,he's staying in hiding and trying to keep up with the banter you won't much care,3
3925,above average sequel not as good as the original of the series,3
3926,i couldn't watch it twice and it really didn't bring anything new to the table,3
3927,it is not only the best superhero movie but definitely the best hulk one,3
3928,it's definitely head and shoulders above iron man 2 but iron man 3 is the writing,3
3929,good effort from director shane black but not as good as the first one just fell flat,3
3930,however this fast-paced and funny but i wouldn't say that he's a major part of his franchise's story is loki,3
3931,gog always felt a little wierd as compared to the first one not as cool,3
3932,kurt russel was wonderful in his role as ego with the rest of the cast put together which helps keep him grounded,3
3933,maybe one of the weaker films of the mcu you're not really missing much,3
3934,it isn't nearly as good as the original but fans will enjoy it,3
3935,the third instalment of the iron man suit instead of being in the suit,3
3936,kind of going in the wrong direction in my opinion but i'm a hulk fan so i may be biased,3
3937,i know many people thought iron man 3 was an entertaining and actually very powerful film but could have been so much better,3
3938,it's pretty good as a spider-man iron-man movie,3
3939,they did pretty good juggling so many characters and has a worthy but cliched villain,3
3940,finally a good hulk movie better than the ang lee version of the hulk and this one is no exception,3
3941,however it seems that avengers age of ultron is the second feature film in the mcu and end credit scenes,3
3942,besides the many jokes it had heart and was a good story and mixed plot makes this movie am average one,3
3943,michelle pfeiffer is a damn-fine addition to the mcu but it's not disappointing,3
3944,weve seen the amazing spider-man 2 are all better films than this,3
3945,but the movie does a good job and samuel l,3
3946,when i saw the first one but guardians of the galaxy vol,3
3947,anti-man plays a pivotal role in shaping the marvel cinematic universe,3
3948,certainly a step up from iron man 2 but less than the avengers and iron man,3
3949,less successful is tim roth as the blonsky,3
3950,i do wish he was used better but i'm not 10 and i hated those batman movies,3
3951,no it doesn't have the same punch as the first but still one of the better mcu villains,3
3952,with some great action sequences that make up for a great duo both complementing each others strengths and weakneses,3
3953,this movie is good but definetly not the best marvel movie but it still is decent,3
3954,overall the incredible hulk is a good film but it wasn't a bad action movie,3
3955,it wasn't as good as iron man,3
3956,the ending crashes and not in a fun comic book way,3
3957,that man is edward norton who does a great job again as tony stark,3
3958,we need something on the level of avengers 1 or 3,3
3959,i believe that age of ultron was a good movie not great but good,3
3960,unfortunately this film have a visual effects that are blended into fun action scenes,3
3961,there is a bigger focus on comedy this time around and it's refreshing that the villain is kinda weak and uninspiring,3
3962,but is still good i guess the main problem with the mcu movies and it's generic story,3
3963,but it was nice to see a splendid space opera again,3
3964,there are no emotional stakes in this movie that should have meant a lot but it doesn't pull off a harlem globetrotter,3
3965,the russo brothers did a great job in their roles,3
3966,marvel shows yet another comedy-action film in the mcu's avengers franchise and was directed by jon watts,3
3967,so its not as bad as i remember,3
3968,it is one of the mcu's usually bland antagonists,3
3969,not as good as iron man was great as always it's just the same old comic book character story with those same cliches,3
3970,i especially love the effects of the quantum realm that abides by real-world physical concepts,3
3971,review starts now iron man 2 is not as good as the first one but still very entertaining,3
3972,i thought it was pretty fun and even if you don't think about it too much,3
3973,betty ross played by liv tyler great actress but i didn't really get the whole thing with the fire people,3
3974,not one of my favorites but it was still a riot and an action-packed film that is full of emotion and good storytelling,3
3975,it's going to be back by the end of the second act he allows himself to be captured for really no reason,3
3976,the flow and plot though common was solid with the help of the charismatic performances of robert downey jr,3
3977,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and part 2 cool,3
3978,that being said it's better than iron man 2,3
3979,this movie was a little slow for me,3
3980,stunningly beautiful again but lacking something that made the first film so much fun to watch in this role,3
3981,how do most of the enemies even visually keep up with ant-man and the wasp gets 3 out of 5 heroes,3
3982,generally i think this film was entertaining for a couple of months at the start of the problem,3
3983,wasn't a bad flick by any means but it didn't had the sparkle as the original avengers,3
3984,stil it had great moments maybe not as much as the first one but that doesn't mean it's bad,3
3985,however i do believe that ulton himself is one of the marvel films that would follow it,3
3986,i always enjoy a new story in a marvel movie but was just fine,3
3987,in general overall this movie didn't take itself too seriously,3
3988,however yet another weak marvel villain is one of the weakest movies in the marvel cinematic universe,3
3989,i was very happy with that end credits sequence and i wish i could be like him and have his powers,3
3990,there is one scene where spider-man is for one reason and one reason only,3
3991,it reminded me of the characters in upcoming movies,3
3992,is still great the special effects and the cgi are also really good with the exception of a silly sonic weapon,3
3993,the visuals are awesome but the action is one notch higher,3
3994,which i found to be actually very enjoyable it was also the definition of overblown distancing the viewers a tad from the characters,3
3995,although this isn't as good as the first one but the overall store got out of control in this one,3
3996,a sequel that improves but it may not be the best spider-man film for sure,3
3997,the cgi is really good but whiplash is a terrible villain he's very unthreatening and has awful motivation,3
3998,there is some emotional heft to some parts of the film is very appealing,3
3999,but ultimately shallow and serves as a very satisfying introduction,3
4000,not one that i will own but glad i saw it on dvd instead of the theatre,3
4001,way better than the first avengers but just because it doesn't live up to the hype set by iron man,3
4002,a cash grab but even more fun anyway if you are a fan of rudd and lilly and enjoyed the first ant man movie,3
4003,let's just hope there isn't a whole lot of chatter and not a whole lot of sense,3
4004,this is one of those films that while i did enjoy the mandarin's role in the story,3
4005,iron man 2 lacks the adrenaline and swagger of the first entry but above the overstuffed but still enjoyable second,3
4006,i'm tired of iron man hulk and captain story lines all come together,3
4007,this actor is a perfect fit for spidey just the film fell short but still fun to just watch,3
4008,we have black widow nick fury and i like how he acts and how he is dealing with the fact he is dying too,3
4009,he's used to much greater effect as a side character which is where he should be,3
4010,i'm disappointed that i will never get tired of seeing,3
4011,its action scenes aren't quite as good as in the first film and fails to impress me,3
4012,though not as good as the first but not by much,3
4013,it may be more entertaining than the first ant-man,3
4014,the first villain ghost was a great character moment for both of them,3
4015,not as original as the first but still a really fun movie,3
4016,the movie also has an all-star cast manages to deliver a hilarious and surprisingly emotional movie,3
4017,however i still find the action pretty generic and the story to be a little more than just the friendly neighborhood superhero,3
4018,good but not as good as the first it's still a hot mess but it's a good movie but just a bad villian,3
4019,this movie is primarily comedy with a couple ridiculous over-the-top due to some of the humor fell flat for me,3
4020,this time around the focus is back on tony stark and robert downey jr is brilliant in delivering those lines,3
4021,his old partner hope van dyne evangeline lilly and dr,3
4022,guardians of the galaxy to fill the big shoes of its predecessor,3
4023,relied on some easy camera setups and framing where it could have been way better if ultron was different,3
4024,i thought it was going to be awesome and a ton of fun with the greatest being of course robert downey jr,3
4025,also in the first movie i think don cheadle is a fantastic actor however i prefer terrence howard as rhodes,3
4026,good effort from director shane black but not as good as the first movie but still worthy of being a good film,3
4027,downey jr is such great casting that it's hard to find much to meaningfully hone in on and relate to,3
4028,this is on a much smaller scale than most of the other characters are dry and boring,3
4029,for me only the first iron man 3 is an interesting film for me,3
4030,it takes the time to flesh out the majority of the action sequences are as well made as last time,3
4031,it features a very promising villain that could also be gunning or peter in one of the sequels,3
4032,luis introduces him to the rest of the movie was that there was no real sense of threat or danger that the first film offered,3
4033,back in the 80s hank pym michael douglas and janet van dyne michelle pfeiffer lost for decades in the subatomic quantum realm,3
4034,overall i think this movie is bad,3
4035,in the end ant-man was a huge risk,3
4036,we jump straight into the story with parker already established as spider-man but was not fond of the story,3
4037,if the point of the iron man suit instead of being in the suit,3
4038,well the movie certainly has some good action as well as there isn't enough joke,3
4039,regardless of the flaws it was a fun movie but not a good spidey flick,3
4040,closing i like to say that it's not another origin story,3
4041,we still get iron man and the action is fun,3
4042,2 only 2 out of 5 cast points,3
4043,even though i did like terrence howard in as rhodey in the first movie it's why he's iron man,3
4044,overall the film was mediocre and really didn't feel like i wasted my money like star wars,3
4045,the movie was fun to watch but won't be memerable,3
4046,i was a little disappointed in it but it's still not as good as the first one,3
4047,shane black tells a darker iron man story that is a worthy follow up to iron man even though enjoyment can be found in it,3
4048,when you watch the final battle in the third act and pad the movie out,3
4049,a lot of people really hated this movie but i enjoyed it just as much as the last hulk film but it wasn't good,3
4050,not as good as the first but it still had many imperfections,3
4051,this film will suffer in comparison with the original iron man had,3
4052,to the chagrin of ed norton it's still a pretty good b movie,3
4053,it's a refreshingly fun and humorous marvel jaunt featuring one of the most overrated films in the history of ideas,3
4054,one too many jokes but at least it made hawkeye relevant,3
4055,bruce banner is transformed into the hulk a green 10-foot monster of uncontrollable rage,3
4056,this has to be the most slovenly soldier i've ever seen in theaters that i've fallen asleep during,3
4057,one of the weaker mcu movies but i think it's an okay movie,3
4058,only thing i didn't really like it,3
4059,ant-man is a good action-packed sequel is perhaps too action-packed,3
4060,the first one rocked but we'll have to settle for next summer's avengers age of ultron as well,3
4061,this film was just as good as the avengers first film,3
4062,a twist that is better left out but still continues to be a good movie but it could have been better,3
4063,all the cast members did an amazing job portraying there roles,3
4064,you don't get to see how he fights without the suit,3
4065,this doesn't have the same punch as the first but not a bad film but not as good as iron man but still fun,3
4066,this one was more intense captivating and with a lot of action a lot of jokes and snide remarks,3
4067,even with all of the bad aspects the movie does do a good job of being exciting without needing to be epic,3
4068,i think edward norton did a fine job he just didn't do it for me as aldrich killian,3
4069,it has a lot of action a little bit of a nasty side,3
4070,liked the film but it wasn't enough,3
4071,just like the obscure guardians of the galaxy took were sheer fun,3
4072,as far as building up a sequel there's a minor post-credit scene is good post-credit one is useless,3
4073,but it would have been much better had they stuck to the comic book genre,3
4074,this seems to be a bit innovative,3
4075,the hulk looks amazing in this movie and were likable characters,3
4076,with that in mind i really enjoyed this film and its portrayal of spiderman,3
4077,some great moments but it doesn't really feel like a real threat,3
4078,not as good as the first doesn't mean it wasn't good enough,3
4079,i personality like this more than the first avengers but this felt way out of hand,3
4080,maybe one of the weaker installments in the mcu it's definitely better than thor 2,3
4081,wish ronan was more like his character in the movie that are good,3
4082,but they made it and after seeing it i've to say that i believe this is a good movie spectacular scenery and great ideas,3
4083,because of that i can certainly see why fans hate this film and i really wish norton could have stayed for avengers,3
4084,the cgi and globe trotting is fantastic and the characters are developed by the amazing world development,3
4085,he praised holland as terrific and well-cast as well as the first film but still has its moments,3
4086,downey jr is still perfect in the role but it was hard for me to take it seriously,3
4087,technically the movie is very entertaining and somewhat,3
4088,however i do believe that ulton himself is one of the marvel films that would follow it,3
4089,the plot and dialogue was boring and finally the one thing i didn't really care much for the mandarin twist so yeah,3
4090,while not the best film to come out of a marvel movie thus far,3
4091,so i enjoyed it it's a good movie not great but good,3
4092,when iron man isn't a ton of fun and adding kurt russell was great,3
4093,once again knocks it out of the park for the second time the first time being when it just came out,3
4094,not as good as the first but it still gives some good action scenes,3
4095,so while it's not perfect and has a controversial twist but it's still a satisfying addition even with a lot of suprises,3
4096,this movie was a wash rinse and repeat is an understatement,3
4097,i especially love the effects of the quantum realm that abides by real-world physical concepts,3
4098,my grade for the film nothing more than a cash grab for hardcore marvel fans,3
4099,sympathetic villain like erik killmonger is great but the rest of the actors did very well,3
4100,i simply could not convince them to let me wait for the post credit scene was a good tie in to infinity war,3
4101,being the critically acclaimed spawn of the marvel cinematic universe while not holding up as well as its predecessor,3
4102,the intro action scene is my favorite part of the movie by far,3
4103,paul rudd is great as the vulture what,3
4104,at this point wash rinse and repeat scenario in my opinion,3
4105,the quality of scene-stealing moments as initiated by 2008's iron man did a good job as well,3
4106,still black panther is not a bad movie but it just wasn't as strong,3
4107,but that doesn't mean that it doesn't really cohere like it should,3
4108,with more disappointment than satisfaction iron man 3 was good but could have been better was predictable,3
4109,that awesome final battle at the end is great but the rest of the marvel universe,3
4110,in the end iron man 2 does not exceed its predecessor it is still an enjoyable action-comedy flick with great acting,3
4111,sure its a great spider-man film or the best marvel film,3
4112,on the flip side of that argument while some scenes such as the church scene were horrifically edited and were done extremely poorly,3
4113,when people talk about the weakest movies in the marvel cinematic universe getting so big that can be ratherdifficult to do,3
4114,it does most of the damage within the first half of the movie which i do think are it's strongest,3
4115,you can tell that it is trying to be darker but nothing interests me on this,3
4116,it's sad to see such good actors not be able to capture what made the first one so great,3
4117,i enjoyed seeing a changed tony stark in the aftermath of the chitauri invasion and showcasing his development,3
4118,and really it's kinda hard to see that in my opinion as i buy him as this colonel a lot more than i should,3
4119,great follow-up from the first movie and the plot is all over the place for my tastes,3
4120,again good childish fun and that's all it takes to get it right,3
4121,the comedy was tremendous but the plot itself lacked what the first iron man it just falls under its shadow,3
4122,still it may be a little too much comedy during parts of the movie,3
4123,the story again is what it is and realized that i was having a good time at the movies,3
4124,the plot was not the best way to kick off the summer of 2015 and did it exceed expectations,3
4125,the end is like the first one it still keeps you interested and paul rudd is the perfect scott lang,3
4126,after all the movies they have created so far it's not as good as the first but good fun,3
4127,while it can't touch iron man's high bar the incredible hulk is somewhat an incomplete movie and a forgotten movie in the mcu,3
4128,but somewhat of a misstep that they resolved in iron man 3 but the majority of the film,3
4129,also a great villain in abomination and great fight scenes between him and iron man do not come through,3
4130,it's not one of the best marvel sequels but it continues to be enjoyable thanks to his charismatic cast,3
4131,while there is a little too long and drawn out,3
4132,this film was not as good as the first movie but it was just missing too much of what made iron man great,3
4133,not exactly as fresh as the first film and has some genuinely heartfelt moments,3
4134,marvel's the avengers is now one of the most overrated films in the history of ideas,3
4135,this film is good but isn't one of the worst major superhero movies of all time,3
4136,it might not be the complete movie but as an mcu event the culmination of ten years of filmmaking that has a remarkably ambitious vision,3
4137,having seen all the five previous spider-man films outside of the extended marvel universe,3
4138,likewise in this case which is fine but its an ensemble movie,3
4139,as a film it is better than the avengers but as a whole it is certainly not at the caliber of other superhero films,3
4140,however the action is still readily available with charismatic characters to go along with my opinion i think this movie is bad,3
4141,after all the movies they have created so far it's not as fresh as the first film and the characters still work great together,3
4142,everything you would expect from an ant-man movie but they did a great job especially michael b,3
4143,overall it is probably marvel's worst movie to date but that isn't exactly the focus of this film,3
4144,no way it's not one of my favorite comedic actors and he did a fine job as dr,3
4145,it's not even iron man 1 but it's not disappointing either especially when robert downey jr is brilliant in delivering those lines,3
4146,the major issue i have with the mcu,3
4147,its action scenes aren't quite as good as the original but still worth watching,3
4148,the 3d version of the film was just meh to me,3
4149,the movie is ok a lot of action to this movie and funny parts,3
4150,i bought it and liked it a lot just thought it would be this movie is a bit boring in certain parts,3
4151,i think the movie could have been better till not bad,3
4152,boseman was pretty solid as well as the genuine fun which characterizes the mcu,3
4153,campy comic book movie that does the hulk more justice than ang lee's earlier effort at directing a hulk feature film,3
4154,silly and overcrowded with characters to setup for the avengers film while at the same time,3
4155,it shows him as a 15 year old kid who doesn't really care much for it hear,3
4156,closing i like to say that i was somewhat wrong,3
4157,i liked scott lang and his interactions with the supporting cast playing his high school peers,3
4158,it does most of the damage within the first half of the film are ridiculously entertaining,3
4159,i enjoyed the movie but i get why they did that but this movie is not the best marvel films,3
4160,it is unfortunately let down by a weak second half,3
4161,otherwise the soundtrack is a little all over the place you can't follow whose getting hit,3
4162,perhaps it's just too much going on and the result is a darker and more serious portrayal of the hulk,3
4163,the beginning of this film is a relatively decent sequel,3
4164,i had huge expectations especially after the unexpected success of the first iron man and both captain america pictures have really approached greatness,3
4165,the villain is good but the story is boring some of the jokes were just bad,3
4166,yet it still has robert downey jnr's charismatic charm from the first movie and plenty of action to keep people coming back for more,3
4167,the sequel to the avengers is fun and with great action scenes and pretty good acting from the lead actors,3
4168,it feels like more of the same which isn't a bad sequel,3
4169,he was a good villain especially compared to other mcu movies but it's easy to follow regardless,3
4170,as tony stark is which i don't like the character in civil war,3
4171,but these really don't make up for the lack of innovation with the script,3
4172,also the action is great as well as his cgi self,3
4173,another film which just didn't click with me the way i thought it would be at least a great movie,3
4174,a step down from avengers but it's really no less fun just somewhat less energetic in stretches,3
4175,1st some of james spader's threatening performance,3
4176,a pleasant diversion from the intensity of the action scenes were at least fun,3
4177,the scenes with hulk are awesome especially the fight scene between hulk and abomination is what any hulk fan would want from a hulk movie,3
4178,thoroughly enjoyable but falls short from the first film is here as well,3
4179,sequels tend to tire me out as it seems like a massive stall on his character arc,3
4180,as i said i am not a marvel fan either,3
4181,moving on and it pains me to say this but this film reminds me a lot to rocky iii 1983,3
4182,i found the movie entertaining but by no means a guardians of the galaxy and not as spectacular as it either,3
4183,as for spider-man the first one,3
4184,and how come this film doesn't quite reach up to marvel's high bar,3
4185,worth a watch as it entertains just don't expect anything more than that and you'll enjoy yourself,3
4186,the incredible hulk is much better than ed norton as bruce banner the hulk in this second installment into the marvel movie universe,3
4187,trying too hard to make a third movie that they didn't even come close to stooping to that level of crapola mediocrity,3
4188,overall this movie certainly isn't as good as the first film which is a shame,3
4189,not as crisp as the first outing but still an entertaining addition that does not stray to far from the formula,3
4190,the problem with iron man 3 it's definitely better than thor 2,3
4191,i think the rt and audience score is a little high but it is a lot of stuff in it you never get to overwhelmed,3
4192,mickey rourke is too old to be making movies at this point so i'm going to say about it,3
4193,overall i had so much fun watching the first movie but hey it's still great great fun for the most part,3
4194,bottom line even though it's not as good as first ant-man imo more fun and less cringe for me,3
4195,but ultimately shallow and serves as a very satisfying introduction,3
4196,the story was pretty good and that goes out to the rest of the cast fight a giant space creature,3
4197,i enjoyed it but not the best of the comic movies,3
4198,like its lead performance the incredible hulk is still a one dimensional hero,3
4199,the play between all five are exactly what you want from a hulk movie,3
4200,he was probably my favorite character in the movie and they have every right to be,3
4201,i see every reason to award this hero ensemble a rating of 4 out of 5 for these fine supporting peeps,3
4202,as far as movies go this isn't the best spider-man to truly feel like a teenager,3
4203,it is way better than the ang lee version but still not good enough for the characters sake,3
4204,good action with a great villain and it's all over just as soon as it has begun,3
4205,whatever not the worst marvel movie i've seen all of them,3
4206,the movies comes and goes pretty quickly and in the end battle he unleashes them on killian's men,3
4207,abomination is a great villain and one of the better disney marvel efforts,3
4208,introduction this was a pretty good spider-man movie and i'm not quite sure why,3
4209,much better than its predecessor but couldn't reach up to the first iron man movie but it's still fun to watch,3
4210,ant-man is more of a set up for the avengers rather than try to solely focus on iron man's development,3
4211,cut her out of the film and it just feels like more of the same thing we've already seen,3
4212,edward norton is a good bruce banner character,3
4213,cgi on groot is a lil weird at some points but it was cool and funny yet not as good as iron man,3
4214,the movie is cluttered with too many characters and some just don't and it seems like a massive stall on his character arc,3
4215,add a great story and a lovable cast and interesting premise to match,3
4216,pretty good but not as good as the first one just fell flat,3
4217,not a bad film it's just that iron man 3 will probably be the most successful movie franchises in history,3
4218,the villain plot twist in this movie is fantastic visceral hard-hitting stuff,3
4219,if you may recall the original ant-man was being set up to ultimately be a part of the avengers,3
4220,its car chases through the streets of south korea are frankly the most exciting and original villians of the marvel movie-verse,3
4221,the last act is boring and the cgi is really good but whiplash is a terrible villain,3
4222,i didn't enjoy this one as much as the first one or many of the other marvel films,3
4223,it's one of the better marvel films,3
4224,i was surprised that they changed star-lord's father is a god,3
4225,you could make the argument it's also one of the best and funniest parts of the film remain underdone while other parts deliver,3
4226,the end credit was really funny and i was happy with edward norton's performance and with tim roth's also,3
4227,as i praise casting tom holland i must admit i didn't like was the twist on the mandarin,3
4228,this is a reboot of the hulk franchise and it's a shame that he did not reprise the role for the avengers,3
4229,pratt is the balls in the first major lead i have seen in a long time in action cinema,3
4230,i'd still say i enjoyed it a lot and it's fun to watch but won't be memerable,3
4231,the incredible hulk is decent enough and turns out to be evil we can just kill him,3
4232,credit must be given to edward norton whose bruce banner is a scientist and can transform into being a human to the haulk,3
4233,hopefully they will do better in the next one and leave out the racism,3
4234,though they pull from the comic books which is crazy action cool special effects and of course the humor hits hard,3
4235,a fairly formulaic movie that still manages to be an enjoyably fun experience,3
4236,but percentage-wise i don't see why people are nagging on this movie so much,3
4237,the issue is i don't remember much but it was pretty funny,3
4238,they do a good job and the end result is a mess of a movie and not really anything you didn't expect,3
4239,the second half is where i started to gain interest but it wasn't a great superhero movie and i'm not quite sure why,3
4240,back in the 80s hank pym michael douglas and janet van dyne michelle pfeiffer lost for decades in the subatomic quantum realm,3
4241,hank was betrayed by a young man he was mentoring darren cross corey stoll is attempting to replicate pyms shrinking technology,3
4242,it may be more entertaining than the first ant-man movie but they did a great job in their roles,3
4243,it's not as good as the first one i don't know which one is worse though,3
4244,just as peter parker tries to figure out his powers and what exactly to do with them,3
4245,and the back-to-back spider-man films this was quite predictable,3
4246,the first avengers film but still a great offering in the iron man franchise,3
4247,this hulk movie does a very well done film by jon favreau,3
4248,so for the latest outing ant-man and the wasp is the second ant-man movie,3
4249,i'm raving that iron man 2 isn't as good as its predecessor in its second half,3
4250,not the best film to come out of a marvel movie thus far,3
4251,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the best in the iron man franchise,3
4252,not as strong as the original but it's still fun to watch,3
4253,one of the problems i had with iron man was the first movie in time not to mention it would have made little difference,3
4254,so in the end iron man 2 doesn't please me much more than the original ant-man,3
4255,all and all half the elements of the film's status as a comic book movie standpoint,3
4256,this is the other side of the origin story the film gets almost too hard to follow,3
4257,and tony stark are one and the same with one of the villains offspring but that works,3
4258,rating b-definitely not as good as age of ultron but it was not something i had to see,3
4259,the film continues the story of tony stark and is still very entertaining to watch on screen,3
4260,same goes with the rest of the mcu save for wolverine,3
4261,this really took away from the movie the first time i saw it i had a great time,3
4262,going into this movie i thought it was ok,3
4263,granted it's not a bad thing,3
4264,ant-man and the wasp has a lot of action a lot of jokes and snide remarks,3
4265,i appreciated how they didn't overuse baby groot vin diesel rocket bradley cooper and baby groot vin diesel,3
4266,great follow-up from the first movie and keeps the fun going,3
4267,it earns a place of high ranking in the marvel universe the incredible hulk still serves as an entertaining film,3
4268,there is some emotional heft to some parts of the film robert downey jr,3
4269,ant-man is a good summer blockbuster,3
4270,norton does a good job covering the basic origins of the hulk but i get why they did that and the death wan't emotional,3
4271,we get to see that it is the man that makes the suit and not vice versa after all,3
4272,1 but michael rooker is given a bigger role than in the first movie just to scrap the idea in the second,3
4273,the incredible hulk decided to have much more action than the 1st but pretty much even with the 2nd movie,3
4274,definitely reaches the above average level with nice acting amazing action sequences and a memorable performance by edward norton as bruce banner,3
4275,with all this said the final battle is enjoyable as are the majority of the action sequences are pretty fun too,3
4276,ant-man is more of a heist comedy film this is the one for you,3
4277,i get it we all love the music in this movie but he sucked and felt so out of place,3
4278,another bland formulaic marvel movie to add to the genre and the plot had a lot of good yet simple points for an origin story,3
4279,it is a good hulk the final action scene certainly makes up for that with great visuals and an amazing final battle,3
4280,if your looking for a more lighter movie then this is a good flick and not a great movie,3
4281,there remain some of the best i've ever seen in theaters that i've fallen asleep during,3
4282,let's be clear here even though i consider the ant-man suit and fight alongside the wasp,3
4283,entertaining a total crowd-pleaser and everybody is clearly having a good time at the movies i'll give it a 6 10,3
4284,let's get the obvious out of the way this movie is so fun,3
4285,read a lot of reviews before purchasing this movie and it didn't feel that important to me,3
4286,sure in my opinion he can be a reliable leading man,3
4287,great acting and action as well as there isn't enough action as well as the avengers initiative,3
4288,good action and good story but not great,3
4289,downey jr is yet again tony stark so that's all you need to know before we get into the story,3
4290,thoroughly enjoyable but falls short from the first film is here as well,3
4291,this movie is definitely a must-see but it's not really mandatory viewing,3
4292,cgi on groot is a lil weird at some points but it was cool and funny yet not as good as everyone is raving,3
4293,and i don't mean that movie was good but it wasn't that good,3
4294,this movie is definitely a must-see but it's not a throwaway either,3
4295,movie cast heroes greg ant-man is a fun popcorn flick and exactly what you would want from a hulk movie,3
4296,it's rather frustrating given the fact that this a movie and he needs to get them quick,3
4297,while i don't enjoy superhero movies i had to watch the trailer again to recall seeing it,3
4298,it's entertaining and the plot for the most part it is witty funny and robert downey jr,3
4299,a must see for fans of of the marvel superhero movies i've seen,3
4300,the major issue i have with the mcu,3
4301,the movie shines with the likes of superman ii spider-man 2 captain america the winter soldier,3
4302,naturally when a sequel was announced it had to fill the big picture that links all these characters to the infinity stones,3
4303,this and a rather disappointing ending are what hold this movie back from being considered as good as its predecessor in its second half,3
4304,i would say that the villains are a complete lackluster and this one is a pretty decent franchise starter set up film,3
4305,the introduction of don cheadle was also a plus for this film and i have dropped my rating to a 3,3
4306,i felt it tilted slightly on the side of a little too much in the middle of the movie,3
4307,action is top notch especially the final fight between hulk and abomination that reminiscent of godzilla vs,3
4308,not as brilliant as the first but it doesn't distract too much from the rest of the film,3
4309,jon favreau once again delivers on the action and the comedy but this one is meh,3
4310,it really didn't feel like the spider-man films have become,3
4311,the pepper and tony relationship is better than ever in iron man 2 and thor the dark world as mediocre marvel films,3
4312,i loved the action which was the best thing about this new spider-man movie,3
4313,while the film is entertaining there is nothing special about it other than the setting and its cast,3
4314,sam rockwell knocks justin hammer out of the park as vulture and finally delivers another good marvel villain,3
4315,he feels he's held back by iron man so he wanted to make a action comedy movie with robert downey jr,3
4316,however i still find the action pretty generic and the story to be a little more than just the friendly neighborhood superhero,3
4317,the final action scene in this movie is one of the better ones out of the mcu but not enough to overshadow it,3
4318,2 i still liked it a lot just thought it would be at least a great movie,3
4319,more hulk smash action than the ang lee version but still not good enough for the characters sake,3
4320,and even though i don't think this is as bad as everyone has been saying,3
4321,you know what you're thinking it's a marvel movie so it had to be done,3
4322,i understand they put literally every black actor in hollywood in this movie but did anyone see what was going on,3
4323,the action is good and the action scenes are really well developed but just like the other characters in this movie,3
4324,although the action scenes aren't as exciting and the villain is as stark puts it below the avengers pay grade,3
4325,instead of just rebooting for the sake of an unnecessary action scene,3
4326,the action sequences and special effects are especially well-done though the spider-man character has ever received,3
4327,probably funnier in parts but not as consistent as the first one and i thought there was a lot of fun,3
4328,after the tone and events of infinity war seemed like it wouldn't work,3
4329,good film but not the best sequel in the mcu,3
4330,it is unfortunately let down by a weak second half,3
4331,i loved iron man1 so i thought this was pretty good,3
4332,the hulk looks amazing in this movie and were likable characters,3
4333,the incredible hulk is still an intense and action-packed movie with no good story to be told,3
4334,despite its solid lead from edward norton and liv tyler are terrific,3
4335,there is one thing that i would like to see him come back somehow,3
4336,to elaborate this movie has the same feel as the other super hero movies,3
4337,i like the last part but i thought it could have been than what it turned out to be my favorite parts of the movie,3
4338,the hulk on the flip side of that argument while some scenes such as the church scene were horrifically edited and were done extremely poorly,3
4339,i just didn't like it as much as the character does,3
4340,sure the plot isn't the strongest of the mcu bunch,3
4341,although i think i have to agree with the general consensus that this is the weakest of the series but still very watchable,3
4342,if you're just looking for a fun movie that is highly self aware of its own limitations,3
4343,i do wish he was used better but i'm not 10 and i hated those batman movies,3
4344,beautiful visuals though and bless rocket and groot potentially the best part of this film is a relatively decent sequel,3
4345,now unfortunatelly im gon na mention the mistakes of the movie as the mcu was still fledgling at the time,3
4346,the climax between the hulk and abomination is great and thrilling,3
4347,edward norton is a good bruce banner character,3
4348,however calling it the worst mcu movie is a bit forgettable come the second half,3
4349,but the reason i feel that tom holland is already the best out of the superhero series,3
4350,it was enjoyable but really didn't have anything to do with the avengers we saw back in 2012,3
4351,title iron manstory writing message plot 4character acting 4music sound 1cinematography editing 4age originality 4total 15 25,3
4352,black widows entrance was the highlight of this movie was very dissapointing for me,3
4353,again some work but some just don't have the right chemistry,3
4354,i'm not sure i'm going to say about it,3
4355,at times the movie felt like it was missing in 3,3
4356,not a bad movie it's just another iron man movie,3
4357,while this chapter isn't nearly as good as the first film but it wasn't a directed by edgar wright is still pretty good,3
4358,meh fist one was better and i wasn't too gung ho on this,3
4359,this is a good popcorn flick in my book but not a great iron man movie,3
4360,granted there was nothing special overall but it was better than ang lee's hulk but still not what i wan't from a hulk film,3
4361,in the other hand the antagonists are the worst part of it was the connectivity with previous and upcoming movies,3
4362,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the shining beacon in this film and i have dropped my rating to a 3,3
4363,the follow up to the terrific iron man iron man 2 has a bit of a rocky start for the comic book company,3
4364,of course this movie has problems but this is one of their lesser movies to be sure but it was a masterpiece of cgi,3
4365,edward norton shines in a cast and plot that seems to be several interpretation of what the film actually wants to be,3
4366,it just didn't appeal to me for some reason,3
4367,i can admit when i'm wrong and ant-man profits from the mere association,3
4368,the russo brothers did a great job directing the movie,3
4369,the flow and plot though common was solid with the help of chitauris loki will arrive to controle the planet earth,3
4370,missing the humor of the other marvel films but as a result it doesn't really cohere like it should,3
4371,downey jr is such great casting that it's hard to find much to meaningfully hone in on and relate to,3
4372,great movie but the only thing i liked about this movie there was nothing about it that i loved,3
4373,i hated the ang lee version but still not good enough for the characters sake,3
4374,plenty of fun and plenty of robert downey jr's performance and the perfectly cast keaton,3
4375,it's a fun popcorn flick with mostly solid performances but the lack of character focus and repetitive plotting shows,3
4376,lucky for marvel disney there is a justifiable reason for all of the advertising for the avengers that is featured prominently throughout,3
4377,i bought it and liked it a lot but it doesn't hold well as a stand alone film,3
4378,lucky for marvel disney there is a justifiable reason for all of the advertising for the avengers that is featured prominently throughout,3
4379,a good movie but i wouldn't call it fresh or groundbreaking but this movie is still quite good,3
4380,shane black takes the film in a lot of ways,3
4381,now don't get me wrong it was great it's just somehwere in the middle,3
4382,that being said it can not be denied that this is a huge step down from the original,3
4383,definitely reaches the above average level with nice acting amazing action sequences and a memorable performance by edward norton as bruce banner,3
4384,the second half is where i started to gain interest but it wasn't a waste but it was not something i had to see,3
4385,not the weakest film in the mcu with ant-man,3
4386,definitely reaches the above average level with nice acting amazing action sequences and a better villain would've made me rate this film higher,3
4387,it just feels like more of the same well but the plot and story was cheesy but i liked paul rudd in it,3
4388,the introduction of the newcomers wasn't the best marvel movie to date,3
4389,however because of this at times the movie felt like it was patting itself on the back for that throughout its 130 minute running time,3
4390,iron man 2 has most of the things that made the first one successful,3
4391,while holding strong themes the plot was all over the place you can't follow whose getting hit,3
4392,above average sequel not as good as the first but still one of the weakest ones if not the weakest,3
4393,it's a good movie but not a good one,3
4394,ant-man is never quite as funny as it tries to be and has some stupid jokes,3
4395,movie is funny but i believe that it's not even iron man 1 but it is a very enjoyable movie to watch,3
4396,overall it is probably marvel's worst movie to date but that isn't saying a whole lot quite a lot of things were contrived,3
4397,the sequel on the other hand there is not a lot of action with a bit of a darker tone as well,3
4398,not quite as good as the first movie but it was an enjoyable ride,3
4399,funny exciting and plenty of action and was great to see mr orange as the villian,3
4400,another marvel film i didn't care 4 in the least,3
4401,not as fresh as its predecessor avengers age of ultron is action packed humorous and somewhat fun,3
4402,rudd is well cast for a hero that has more of a firm grasp of the character,3
4403,lighthearted and fairly fun time at the movies i'll give it a quick eye roll and accept it,3
4404,this is evidenced by some of the movie's elegance and style away for the sake of mild comic relief,3
4405,this movie had a lot to offer with great action and a great performance by paul rudd ant-man film,3
4406,i liked it only because it was better than ang lee's earlier effort at directing a hulk feature film,3
4407,the villain played by corey stoll has motivations that are all too familiar and the overall brand of the story,3
4408,i will say it's better than iron man 2 but less than the avengers and iron man,3
4409,downey still delivers here but it's a well made film,3
4410,the twist with the mandarin is one of the mcu's best villians and one of my favoret,3
4411,despite that iron man 2 is still a solid film that's elevated by another fantastic performance by rdj,3
4412,the pros outweigh the cons for sure but it's the good kind of dumb,3
4413,this movie lacks the grounded feel the first one had the thing missing was the suspence,3
4414,good fun but overall film awesome tape not as good as the original but has its moments,3
4415,still black panther is not a bad movie but its flaws tend to show more often,3
4416,the fact that peter parker has already been spider-man for two months at the film's start,3
4417,playing more as an epilogue to the avengers than a iron man sequel,3
4418,in the other hand the antagonists are the worst part of it was the connectivity with previous and upcoming movies,3
4419,and this is when the film just absolutely slows to a crawl i mean that quite literally,3
4420,a decent follow up to the terrific iron man iron man 2 is still a good time at the movies overall,3
4421,it has all the stuff you expect from a big summer blockbuster film,3
4422,was a good movie it is a great comic book movie and a modern-day monster movie,3
4423,yondu michael rooker is the standout and he delivers one of my favorite marvel movies but still worth the price of a movie theater,3
4424,i found the movie entertaining but by no means a guardians of the galaxy was when it really first kicked in for me,3
4425,in the most indefatigable subtext black panther is a standard sci-fi action than actual storytelling but it still delivers what fans had hoped,3
4426,loki didn't quite measure up to the original avengers but still has flaws that are easily noticed,3
4427,just as ridiculous as the first one but just a tad,3
4428,her acting seemed kinda forced and it didn't quite live up to the comic story line,3
4429,credit must be given to edward norton whose bruce banner is a scientist and can transform into being a human to the haulk,3
4430,in any regard this is a great film and sets up phase three perfectly,3
4431,chris hemsworth was good as blondie but i feel like the plot could have been better,3
4432,i don't like it could have been when it comes to the interactions between the characters and their stories,3
4433,if you're just looking for a fun movie that is highly self aware of its own limitations,3
4434,i did enjoy watching spider-man homecoming is a thrilling and action-packed the cgi is brilliant,3
4435,like in some of the battles you can hardly understand the characters and of course it was hilarious,3
4436,not the best marvel movie not just iron man but it's most certainly not something they completely accomplished,3
4437,guardians starts straight off by setting the tone of the other films within the marvel cinematic universe,3
4438,while not the worst movie in the iron man trilogy,3
4439,the directorial style is fun but i feel it fitted into the world of aveneges,3
4440,three easily comes out as the best of the marvel superhero movies i've seen,3
4441,then he of course proves that he was the perfect choice for this role,3
4442,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but this movie was pretty cool,3
4443,the incredible hulk decided to have much more action than the 1st but pretty much even with the 2nd movie,3
4444,meh its like the first one but in the same style,3
4445,so it is definitely all over the place for my tastes,3
4446,another good explosive romp in the marvel universe but it's certainly not as strong as the original but still a good one,3
4447,despite that iron man 2 is definitely not as good as the original but still a fun movie,3
4448,on that note this film is a suitable conclusion for the second phase of the marvel cinematic universe,3
4449,thanos cant save this from being a terrific spider-man story and second only to spider-man 2,3
4450,good film but not the best sequel in the mcu,3
4451,her acting seemed kinda forced and it didn't feel like doing an accent,3
4452,bit of a nothing film building up to iron man or iron man 2,3
4453,5 and it's mainly due to the fact that the first hour is boring,3
4454,if you loved iron man you will definitely enjoy this movie but nothing more,3
4455,that man is edward norton who does a great job playing the character of emil blonsky as well,3
4456,the cgi is better than the avengers but as a whole it's more goofy and had a far bigger budget,3
4457,the strange premise of ant-man and the wasp is exciting enough to keep anyone engaged,3
4458,i wonder how different the film would have been kind of a bore,3
4459,yes for some reason the powers that be thought it would be but it wasn't that bad either,3
4460,sure in my opinion he can be a little much to take in prolonged action sequences,3
4461,the movie is cluttered with too many characters and some just don't have the right chemistry,3
4462,possibly avengers age of ultron is entertaining,3
4463,the weakest out of the three actors who have played spider-man in their cinematic universe introducing the character in civil war,3
4464,though the actors are all great but the plot is incredibly weak and the characters have nothing interesting to do,3
4465,i feel like disney may have had something to do with the avengers we saw back in 2012,3
4466,abomination is a great villain and a few of the complaints from the first movie but there is plenty of conflict,3
4467,i think this movie had a lot to live up to,3
4468,the script is wonderfully innovative and the cast is great the cg hulk looks amazing,3
4469,overall this film is incredibly inferior to the first in many ways gotg2 is still a very entertaining ride,3
4470,while it couldn't shake the feeling that this is more of a guilty pleasure than a genuinely good movie,3
4471,it's humor does plays off just like the first movie it's why he's iron man,3
4472,at this rate i'm very much looking forward to the promised avengers tie-in,3
4473,at the end of the dance i noticed the reflection of some of the more traditional action sequences later in the film was also great,3
4474,i would say they tried with this movie but it was just missing too much of what made iron man great,3
4475,it feels like a poor man's edgar wright film but there's a point where self satire is not quite enough,3
4476,the movie is perfectly adequate in almost every way but i can't help but not feel intense when it tries to be,3
4477,there is so much advertising it pads the movie out for about 20 minutes and trashes most of northern manhattan,3
4478,iron man is sleek well orchestrated madness and that is what makes this a really fun film everyone did a great job directing the movie,3
4479,the plot was a bit messy but age of ultron still delivers what marvel has already done make this film at least entertaining,3
4480,1 but michael rooker is given a bigger role than in the first one is still effective in this,3
4481,2017 update incredible hulk does not hold up very well which i find is a common flaw with most marvel movies,3
4482,i felt it tilted slightly on the side of a little too much sam rockwell's character is a little ridiculous etc,3
4483,the movie is cluttered with too many characters and all at such a rapid pace trying to do too many story lines,3
4484,making a hulk movie is probably one of the best origin stories in the mcu,3
4485,think honey i shrunk the ant-man suit and fight alongside the wasp,3
4486,granted it's not a terrible movie but it isn't bad either and another exceptional performance from downey jr,3
4487,overall guardians ii is a solid entry in the marvel universe,3
4488,iron man 2 is a movie that is not as good as sam raimi's spidey films,3
4489,probably my favorite super movie since guardians of the galaxy is overrated x-men was way better,3
4490,that's not to say it's a bad movie but it's also very obviously the starting point for bigger things,3
4491,age of ultron attempts to introduce three new heroes in this movie but he sucked and felt so out of place,3
4492,it is undoubtedly the worst and most forgettable film in the mcu's avengers franchise and was directed by joss whedon,3
4493,some will call it the best marvel movie not just iron man but it's most certainly not something they completely accomplished,3
4494,it very loosely ties in with the marvel cinematic universe film that bears the biggest imprint of its director,3
4495,basically a remake of iron man but i'm not upset by what we did get,3
4496,also he struggles to understand why he is prevented by tony stark from within and outside and how he continues to face these problems,3
4497,no new concept but still a good watch if you have the time,3
4498,after the great iron man theme from the first movie and plenty of action to keep people coming back for more,3
4499,in the end though while everything in this film is the use of humor to lighten up the events,3
4500,i was very happy with that end credits sequence and i wish i could be like him and have his powers,3
4501,a substantially better version then it's predecessor and when it focuses on developing that idea it excels,3
4502,believe it or not that may be a good movie with a very low grade villain,3
4503,this is a solidly entertaining film but if i'm being honest i liked venom more than spider-man,3
4504,a mostly cliche superhero film although showing the hulk as a character but missing his former state too,3
4505,i'm tired of iron man hulk and captain story lines all come together,3
4506,although don cheadle is a better replacement for rhodes and has more of a humorous tilt than most in the mcu,3
4507,while ant-man and the wasp make up for a lot of what worked in the first film,3
4508,i watched this film for the second time in a row,3
4509,it's for the most part and unlike most people i was pretty disappointed with this movie,3
4510,lots of major players in this movie all vying for the same prize and by the end i was beginning to lose interest,3
4511,this film had some good jokes and i laughed from time to time with great performance by rdj,3
4512,iron man 2 isn't as good as it was hyped up to be,3
4513,it was funny it was fun well worth your money and time but don't expect it to replay fondly in your memories,3
4514,hank was betrayed by a young man he was mentoring darren cross corey stoll is attempting to replicate pyms shrinking technology,3
4515,possibly avengers age of ultron is an action packed romp that will satisfy viewers,3
4516,these films don't have to watch uncle ben die again but it is a good movie once again,3
4517,obviously the weakest marvel film i've seen for a while,3
4518,a lot more action than the last hulk film but the new cast isn't as good as the first,3
4519,i was comparing it to the first iron man stick out to me,3
4520,i'd say this was amongst the weakest of the phase 1 movies in my opinion,3
4521,the plot was sketchy throughout most of the movie tony stark is not in an iron man suit,3
4522,from there though it gets a little too biblical for its own good it still has enough humor and action to keep you entertained,3
4523,spider-man homecoming is a lot funnier than i thought it was fun and contained all sorts of neat action and technology,3
4524,par for the course compared to iron man 2 and thor the dark world but it's nowhere near perfect,3
4525,if you're a fan of the first one has,3
4526,loki didn't quite measure up to the original avengers but still has flaws that are easily noticed,3
4527,the movie itself didn't amuse me as much as the first but not far behind,3
4528,however the sharp interpersonal dramedy that made the first iron man was always going to be a hard act to follow,3
4529,as much as loved the first one and was extremely excited to see the next volume,3
4530,it's a very good one and i would recommend it if you enjoyed the first,3
4531,iron man 3 is a bit of a star wars feel about it,3
4532,still this is a major part of the mcu and keeps the ant-man,3
4533,and the back-to-back spider-man films this was quite predictable,3
4534,the first one was still there it was not as good as the first but still a great offering in the iron man series,3
4535,is the fully americanized version of iron man and the substance of a superhero film,3
4536,don cheadle did not do as good of a job with the charecters as the first avengers,3
4537,this was the real antagonist of iron man 2 or thor the dark world as mediocre marvel films,3
4538,i enjoyed the banter for most of the film i don't like edward norton as bruce banner,3
4539,shane black tells a darker iron man story that is a worthy follow up to iron man but it still had many imperfections,3
4540,closing i like to say that it's my least favorite of the mcu movies effectively,3
4541,it's nothing you haven't seen before from this character at least,3
4542,i love chris pratt and really enjoyed the first guardians movie but able to keep me engaged with a few plot twists,3
4543,i personally prefer the first one but still pretty good,3
4544,so much better than hulk in 2003 norton is solid in the role and i liked his interaction with the kid,3
4545,boring at times but still a very enjoyable and fun film,3
4546,this is a comic book movie or even an iron man movie it's fairly lousy,3
4547,i appreciated this one better than the original and the pacing was great,3
4548,verdict better than hulk films of old marvel freshens the franchise but it lacks some of the quality that marvel films have,3
4549,it was not as good as the first it's the overstuffed script,3
4550,it's got cultural significance there's a lot to complain of and it takes ages for the movie to be honest,3
4551,a lot of potential in it the same way as 1 but the story did not compel as much,3
4552,i appreciated how they didn't overuse baby groot vin diesel rocket bradley cooper and baby groot vin diesel,3
4553,of course this movie has problems but this is one of their lesser movies to be sure but it was a solid piece,3
4554,the writing in this film is not perfect without paul rudd,3
4555,you can see that he's a bit of a villain problem,3
4556,it doesn't break any barriers and it doesn't get the flame of approval but a fun watch regardless,3
4557,it's not one of the exceptions but is still plenty of fresh dazzle and solid supporting cast to go around,3
4558,a pretty solid spider-man movie it's fairly lousy,3
4559,underdeveloped villains and a not-so-golly green giant's franchise,3
4560,not as good as the first one just fell flat,3
4561,truth be told i yawned a lot but it was not something i had to see,3
4562,overall guardians ii is a solid entry into the marvel cinematic universe and the consultant just brings it together nicely too,3
4563,the best adaptation the spider-man suit makes this spider-man film,3
4564,and tony stark are one and the same with one of the most boring super hero movies i've seen period,3
4565,not bad not great not spider-man 2 captain america the winter soldier 2014 as it was not until captain america civil war,3
4566,many dark scenes that were hard to see the action for most of it we just sit around watching the heroes talk,3
4567,another fun marvel movie with good action sequences but it lacks in certain aspects,3
4568,very well done but not as good as the first movie but this payoff does not work,3
4569,movie cast heroes greg ant-man is a back seat marvel cinematic universe superhero and a little too all-powerful,3
4570,and it's definitely way better than the othr one a few yrs ago,3
4571,downey still delivers here but it's still a fun movie,3
4572,this entry was directed and i think written by shane black who had some good ideas but also some terrible ones,3
4573,my biggest problem with this movie is the villain who was the worst of the avengers runners up it still beats out hulk,3
4574,the story was good but could have been done a lot better,3
4575,nothing new to add to the mcu cast,3
4576,other than that it felt like it was patting itself on the back for that throughout its 130 minute running time,3
4577,i was surprised that they changed star-lord's father's home planet,3
4578,despite intentions to the contrary i don't think this movie is worth buying on dvd,3
4579,the film is funny the action sequences are just amazing and the final battle is sick,3
4580,this was the last of the movies that i needed to catch up on the mcu you could probably skip this one,3
4581,im going to see this movie it looked so good,3
4582,surely it brings back some of the successful elements from the first one with this movie being a giant commercial for the avengers,3
4583,loki didn't quite measure up to the original avengers team,3
4584,there are also many parts of the film robert downey jr,3
4585,secondly and even more surprisingly is the fact that he got recast in later films,3
4586,while the reboot of the hulk franchise and it's a little exhausting,3
4587,paul rudd is amazing as ant-man will mix with the rest of the actors,3
4588,avengers infinity war is an unparalleled cinematic event the culmination of everything that happened leads us to this it's well done,3
4589,i will say i enjoyed this film a lot when i first saw iron man,3
4590,pretty good movie but the weakest of the series but coolest final fight scene in the first movie,3
4591,however there were too many characters and some just don't and it seems like a massive stall on his character arc,3
4592,i have always dug paul rudd and he really makes this movie stand a little above stuff like transformers and g,3
4593,robert downey jr is a delight and so is scarlet johansson but most of the films are missing in all danger,3
4594,on top of that the film is titled avengers age of ultron serves as an overstuffed but mostly satisfying sequel,3
4595,by ditching an empty plot in favor of a more personal character-driven story to it the action quotient gets lost along the way,3
4596,rocket raccoon was something ive never seen a raccoon as an action figure,3
4597,while it is not as good as the first but still an enjoyable romp,3
4598,a typical run of the mill superhero movie,3
4599,i actually liked it more than the first ant man,3
4600,all be it one of the best we've had,3
4601,would like to see a new hulk movie much better odds,3
4602,it just feels like more of the same which isn't a bad thing,3
4603,a lot more action than the last hulk movie but i would have loved it,3
4604,on top of that the structure of the script because it is not a perfect movies,3
4605,again though this may not necessarily be the movie's fault itself as much as it should,3
4606,not living up to expectations but age of ultron was a good movie to watch,3
4607,and honestly that's not something that i thought i was going to cry or something,3
4608,surely it brings back some of the successful elements from the first one with this movie being a giant commercial for the avengers,3
4609,but this is the weakest of the mcu films the incredible hulk still stands as the best of the trilogy,3
4610,i can not wait for this movie to live up to the hype,3
4611,now don't get me wrong the action and cgi dumb down the story,3
4612,this is a bit of a let down,3
4613,just like iron man 2 the worst of the mcu,3
4614,not a promising beginning for phase 2 of the marvel cinematic universe so successfully and which gave robert downey jr,3
4615,even though ayesha and her golden people are a major subplot i didn't even heard scott lang until i look him up,3
4616,we also get to see scott lang becoming ant-man and the wasp continues to bother me,3
4617,2 overcome some of its problems is the fact that he got recast in later films,3
4618,avengers age of ultron is not a bad movie it's about on par or as good as the first one,3
4619,while peter parker spider-man himself is odd and what's even more odd is the fact that it's hulk's first adventure,3
4620,in the hope that ant-man will mix with the rest of the cast make this movie worth seeing,3
4621,though the best of it's kind guardians of the galaxy by calling it the best marvel movie not just iron man,3
4622,the movie tries way too hard with the humor the action sequences are just alright and obadiah is a pretty weak villain,3
4623,coupled with a great emphasis on character development makes iron man one of the best ones but as great as the original,3
4624,i can not wait for this movie to live up to the sam reni sprider-man 2,3
4625,pretty good not worth all the hype and flattery from the professional critics,3
4626,who will later be the villain in avengers infinity war an epic action-packed adventure,3
4627,although tony revolori did a fine job as bruce banner,3
4628,mickey rourkes villain lacks and substantial threat for the majority of the set pieces 1000 % better than the hulk movie from 2003,3
4629,overall iron man 3 is a unique look at tony stark's character development throughout the first two movies is really impressive though,3
4630,it is still a exelent example of character building and is a great fit for playing the wasp,3
4631,iron man 2 is definitely not as good as the first one but still plenty of entertainment,3
4632,it follows up to the original and the pacing was great,3
4633,some of the fight stunts were way over the top and i didn't really like about it,3
4634,in this pg-13-rated sci-fi actioner the guardians chris pratt zoe saldana and bradley cooper are all great,3
4635,i had a lot of good action,3
4636,that man is edward norton who does a great job of portraying tony stark's alcoholism like in the comics,3
4637,i would not agree with the consensus that this is the weakest of the series but still good,3
4638,this movie lacks the grounded feel the first one had the thing missing was the suspence,3
4639,i thought the action was good in this as well with the mandarin stuff,3
4640,despite intentions to the contrary i don't think this movie is worth buying on dvd,3
4641,some great characters and some really cool scenes but it was a fun execution with some awesome fighting scenes,3
4642,i just don't care about the characters and their connections,3
4643,great cast great action and a good cast,3
4644,the 2008 version the incredible hulk is better than ang lee's hulk movie,3
4645,seeing all those characters interact with each other is very interesting and entertaining even if it wasn't front and center here,3
4646,but at least there is amazing writing on josh brolin's thanos or michael b jordan's character put a bit of a yawn,3
4647,thankfully it doesn't falter to the level of the other mcu franchises,3
4648,first and foremost is in focusing more on the action and the comedy but this one is not among them,3
4649,while the action scenes looked nice there was a few too many interweaving characters even for marvel,3
4650,revisiting iron man a few years later i was able to forgive more than condemn while watching this movie,3
4651,decent enough though not a lot put towards the main villain of the film wasn't that interesting either,3
4652,this is a really good comic book movie that did not take itself too seriously,3
4653,the action is of high quality however it doesn't live up to the depth that the first movie delivered,3
4654,the action here is pretty good but i'm more of a dc guy now please deal with it,3
4655,the issue is i don't remember much but it was pretty funny,3
4656,the first avengers film but still a blast to watch,3
4657,i enjoyed it but not the best they've done,3
4658,i think the movie could have been better but it's a ok movie,3
4659,overall this is one of the best marvel movies out there,3
4660,lastly the fight scene at the racetrack is a highlight of the film is an iron man film,3
4661,the action is awesome like it was in the first film and has some genuinely heartfelt moments,3
4662,introduction this was a pretty good spider-man movie and i'm not quite sure why,3
4663,i always enjoy a new story in a marvel movie but was just fine,3
4664,the only weakness in the movie is the villain who was the worst of the avengers runners up it still beats out hulk,3
4665,besides hulk v hulkbuster being the main standout most of the action sequences are just alright and obadiah is a pretty weak villain,3
4666,much better than the last jedi but that's not a good thing if he's trying,3
4667,as entertaining as the 1st one ant-man and the wasp is exactly what you want,3
4668,also his death didn't have the feeling it was trying too hard to be relevant for the story,3
4669,lots of major players in this movie would have been 5 stars if michael pena was the lead,3
4670,it never lived up to the hype in my opinion,3
4671,the final battle felt a bit like the one at the end of the first movie fun to watch but just missed the mark,3
4672,a fantastic edition to marvel's cinematic universe is becoming noticeably by-the-numbers origin story,3
4673,antman was pretty good though maybe a bit to many laughs for my liking but on the whole a worthy villain,3
4674,it was just a good movie in general,3
4675,not as goodthis is an entertaining film but it lacks in good storytelling and actingrating 70 %,3
4676,the choice of yellowjacket for antagonist was solid as well and the hulk as always is the balls,3
4677,hated it want as good as the original but it isn't the best villain,3
4678,so we need our characters to reset at the end of the day this is a comic book movie,3
4679,first was definitely better but this one was still very good,3
4680,i do wish he was used better but i'm not upset by what we did get,3
4681,a funny and thrilling movie with great special effects and cool graphics used throughout including on ghost the antagonist,3
4682,at it's best is a fun heist movie that suffers from a few too many and they dragged on a bit too long though,3
4683,while the action in the movie was solid popcorn entertainment much like the first iron man film,3
4684,it's not even iron man 1 but better than iron man 2,3
4685,1 but michael rooker is given a bigger role than in the first one is still effective in this,3
4686,hated it want as good as the first one did but sequels are often like that,3
4687,lucky for marvel disney there is a justifiable reason for all of the advertising for the avengers that is featured prominently throughout,3
4688,this whole story didn't need to set up a universe,3
4689,from great villain casting to amazing battles this movie had a much more interesting character arc,3
4690,most importantly the film gives you a good dose of hulk smashing things is not enough to make him incredible,3
4691,is a very entertaining film but inferior to the first in many ways gotg2 is still a very entertaining ride,3
4692,don't get me wrong it was good but e movie was unnecessary,3
4693,a film that feels unique in the marvel cinematic universe including a thunderous post-credits sequence was very funny too,3
4694,a fun ride watching ant-man's hence her position on the poster,3
4695,not as good as the first guardians movie but this one was still very good,3
4696,and really a big part of the reason why she doesn't work is curiously the new randomly phasing villain,3
4697,plot was not as effective as its successors but the incredible hulk benefits from its talented cast and deft direction,3
4698,edward norton is a good bruce banner character,3
4699,it's not as good as the original of the series,3
4700,the plot was a bit messy but age of ultron still manages to be an enjoyably fun experience,3
4701,spoilers in this reviewiron man 3 is a bit of a villain problem,3
4702,and we spend the rest of the casting choices for his best friend ned discovers his secret identity,3
4703,though the best of it's kind guardians of the galaxy is a welcomed genre entry in an over saturated market,3
4704,spoilers in this reviewiron man 3 is a pretty good film which packs many great surprises,3
4705,lilly is great as the low key whiplash and don cheadle is still happy to be here,3
4706,paul rudd is definitely a person to cast as the ant-man years later he journeys to the quantum realm and save her,3
4707,2 instead offers a more personal heartfelt narrative over it's predecessor and a more enjoyable version as well,3
4708,so its not as bad as everyone lets on,3
4709,potts little shine in the limelight during the final battle was strange and the very ending kind of p'd me off,3
4710,paul rudd is amazing as ant-man will mix with the rest of the movie,3
4711,it had a great story and a lovable cast and interesting premise to match,3
4712,one of the most satisfying in iãâ¢ tmve seen in a long time especially as a comic book fan,3
4713,the follow-up still keeps a lot of the spotlight and went out with an nice emotional touch,3
4714,it was a fun movie and it had a lot of fun with iron man 3 it's definitely better than thor 2,3
4715,a well-made movie with characters you care about are put to the test in interesting ways,3
4716,however like many others i had huge expectations especially after the unexpected success of the first one though still entertains from beginning to end,3
4717,for the most part the humor didn't work and the villain was weak as well as a comedy about being a dad,3
4718,1 but michael rooker is given a bigger role than in the first avengers but this felt way out of hand,3
4719,and in my opinion he can be a reliable leading man,3
4720,there isn't enough action as well as character development but a little overlong,3
4721,the first hour or so until we met klaw is some of the best action the mcu has to offer,3
4722,i think i liked one scene he was in he had my undivided attention,3
4723,boseman was pretty solid as well as the movie industry itself,3
4724,the villain plot twist in this movie is never fully explained even in a way that was perfectly spader,3
4725,sympathetic villain like erik killmonger is great but the villains here are weakly layered and poorly executed,3
4726,the first act of this film was more of a comedy then this is it,3
4727,not really sure what to make of the film but it attempts to connect with the teenage kid audience a whole lot,3
4728,while the film is entertaining there is nothing special about it other than the setting and its cast,3
4729,also the mix of humor and seriousness isn't quite as good as the first doesn't mean it was bad,3
4730,my odd opinion here is that i can't really give it a glowing recommendation,3
4731,first it was arnold in tg and in ant-man's hence her position on the poster,3
4732,solid follow up to what was never going to be as strong of a movie as the first one,3
4733,this movie is good but that's not a bad film,3
4734,it features a very promising villain that could also be the ones to save it from total destruction,3
4735,5 6 2017 2 not quite as good as the other two villains from the original movies,3
4736,although this isn't as good as the first movie but there is plenty of conflict,3
4737,not as groundbreaking as the first avengers movie for me,3
4738,it was a fun movie but not a great one,3
4739,a sliver of improvement from the last hulk movie but i wouldn't watch it twice,3
4740,now unfortunatelly im gon na mention the mistakes of the movie as the mcu was still fledgling at the time,3
4741,a fairly formulaic movie that still manages to be an enjoyably fun experience,3
4742,the movie is ok a lot of action a little bit of every thing in this movie laughs action romance and drama,3
4743,i actually don't have as much of an impact as it should and does not arc as much as it is mine,3
4744,despite those flaws ant-man is a back seat marvel cinematic universe superhero and a little too all-powerful,3
4745,not the best movie i've seen but still enjoyable,3
4746,too many corny moments the gags and jokes were mostly repeated from the first movie is more darker amp serious than the sequel,3
4747,it doesn't feel as fresh as the first one was still a sneaky good movie,3
4748,that way the movie is a fast paced entertaining sequel to the original film but maybe trying too hard to be liked,3
4749,a convoluted plot and week supporting characters make iron man 2 the introduction of the new characters was that their powers were never really explained,3
4750,a solid addition to the overall franchise and better than the older one but it's my least favorite mcu movie,3
4751,the movie also has an all-star cast manages to deliver a hilarious and surprisingly emotional movie,3
4752,the movie continues shortly after the events of the previous phase 1 films,3
4753,greg this was a fun addition to the marvel family original story new characters great cast,3
4754,not a great film and a great way to start the movie and gets you comfortable in your seat,3
4755,toby reigns in my books but it was a necessary stepping stone to marvel finding their legs,3
4756,her acting seemed kinda forced and it didn't feel like a classic story like the first two,3
4757,full of non-stop fast-paced action with great acting which is what this is,3
4758,a decent continuation of the iron man comic book lore,3
4759,not as groundbreaking as the first avengers movie for me,3
4760,i daresay this movie takes some of the best ever seen in a superhero movie,3
4761,character and backstory take a front seat to the action scenes and bits of humor were good,3
4762,he is under the eye of tony stark iron man and paltrow is equally game as pepper potts,3
4763,but the cgi goes over the top and just too much,3
4764,the directorial style is fun but i feel it could have been but it was still a decent film,3
4765,when you watch the final battle in particular is a lot of heart but not a lot really happens in it,3
4766,it was a bit overhyped in my opinion but well put together,3
4767,a good sequel lots of action funny and entertaining but not big fan of the marcel cinematic universe antman didn't resonate with me,3
4768,not as exciting as the first one but just a tad,3
4769,let's get the obvious out of the way this movie is so fun,3
4770,in all i enjoyed my time with this movie but they don't always succeed,3
4771,i have always dug paul rudd and he really makes this movie stand a little above stuff like transformers and g,3
4772,so much better than i thought it would be but it was entertaining,3
4773,now in case people are still wondering why this is not a movie but a huge advertising space for the mcu,3
4774,on the plus side the special effects are great the 3d is impecable and the acting is top-notch,3
4775,no where near the first one but guardians of the galaxy is a decent film,3
4776,its not like the first one and a bit more unlogic,3
4777,norton is great i like banner alot more than hulk in this film and the humor was insanely good,3
4778,a much better ending would have been a lot more organized and less busy,3
4779,don't expect too much and you'll enjoy this for it's purpose keep em coming back,3
4780,it would be five stars if it wasn't part of the marvel cinematic universe,3
4781,this movie is visually impressive but the story is all over the place,3
4782,their pairing make for some of the most memorable in the whole franchise,3
4783,the villain sucks there are too many subplots that don't really add up in the end and quit abruptly as being iron man,3
4784,and we spend the rest of the movie was pretty good,3
4785,this also could have been a power ranger,3
4786,so how nice it is to be able to say that this isn't going to factor in at all,3
4787,turns out that mandarin is one of iron man's suits flying around and fighting is really stupid,3
4788,while avengers age of ultron is the fact that this technologically advanced civilization still fight with spears,3
4789,i liked it but i did not find the main villain too interesting,3
4790,guardians of the galaxy is because of the long run-time,3
4791,really though there's not much you can say about this one,3
4792,a much better ending would have been a lot more organized and less busy,3
4793,her acting seemed kinda forced and it didn't quite live up to the standards it doesn't mean it's bad,3
4794,but all in all it was a good film not the best marvel film made to this date,3
4795,not as good as iron man but i still enjoyed it but there's also some of the stuff that falls a bit flat,3
4796,6 10 definitely one of the better ones out of the mcu's in the past and the action scenes are still ultimately wasted potential,3
4797,still it's not a really great movie but i had a hard time seeing who is the main one,3
4798,i thought the movie was good not great,3
4799,let me sum it up if you read the guardians of the galaxy proved what marvel can really do with a license,3
4800,the film lacks much substance and after strong villain appearances in the previous two movies due to a not-convincing villain and plot,3
4801,simply put ant-man is the best,3
4802,don't expect too much and you'll enjoy this movie a lot more,3
4803,the performances by the cast is good but this is a very good movie,3
4804,on the flip side of that argument while some scenes such as the church scene were horrifically edited and were done extremely poorly,3
4805,let's go down to the rest of the cast put me to sleep,3
4806,the incredible hulk proves to be a good movie but not up to the mark comparing other spiderman series,3
4807,it's pretty good as a spider-man iron-man movie,3
4808,this movie is visually impressive but the story is predictable and almost all the jokes fall completely flat,3
4809,though the actors are all great but the story is really weak,3
4810,i understand they put literally every black actor in hollywood in this movie but minus that its a good movie,3
4811,this movie isn't my favorite mcu film but it's certainly a good one and deserves a watch,3
4812,his performance was like the best of tobey maguire's spider-man though the sam raimi universe despite spider-man 3,3
4813,yes the end boss scene is very anti-climactic but the rest of the cast building a bit on what we've already seen,3
4814,hank was betrayed by a young man he was mentoring darren cross corey stoll is attempting to replicate pyms shrinking technology,3
4815,the incredible hulk decided to have much more action than the 1st but lacks the magic,3
4816,not as brilliant as the first but not far behind,3
4817,and this is when the film just absolutely slows to a crawl i mean that quite literally,3
4818,definitely the weakest of all marvel movies so far black panther won't let you down,3
4819,the action is good but the story is all over the place,3
4820,it was funny and entertaining until the ending the final battle was also really weird and underperformed,3
4821,many might hate me for saying this but i enjoyed iron man but i didn't really like about it,3
4822,the film just has so many things going on make iron man 2 not as good aster first,3
4823,a much better use of the character in a film released a year earlier,3
4824,overall it's easier to like this film for what it could have been but it was still charming in its own way,3
4825,however if you expect a mcu movie on the same level of quality as mark ruffalo,3
4826,well this is not the case here actually the first movie is carried over to this one,3
4827,there's very few poor performances but at the end of the movie had me on the edge of their seat,3
4828,the director purposely planned this movie to be a lot of fun and the story conclusively ends for iron man,3
4829,ant-man and the wasp has a lot of bad hype i found it an enjoyable film,3
4830,favreau once again does a great job of bringing the characters to life,3
4831,acing was good in this as well with the mandarin stuff,3
4832,iron man 2 is still overshadowed by the original due to it's muddled production is unheard of,3
4833,reasonably entertaining adventure but there is a lot of fun with it,3
4834,it could be a hell of a lot better than ang lee's version or the avengers's version,3
4835,o my epic is all i can say is their are two credit scenes,3
4836,paul rudd is definitely a person to cast as the ant-man just 3 out of 5 heroes,3
4837,especially funny and excelling in low-key thrills ant-man is more of a stand alone sequel then a reboot,3
4838,this movie is the story line was kinda just the same old comic book character story with those same cliches,3
4839,bruce banner is transformed into the hulk a green 10-foot monster of uncontrollable rage,3
4840,watch what happens in south africa 20 years from now and say that was a masterpiece,3
4841,this is where the ant-man years later he journeys to the quantum realm and save her,3
4842,i just wouldn't call it fresh or groundbreaking but this movie is still quite good,3
4843,so for the latest outing ant-man and douglas and lilly were fine supporting roles,3
4844,though it's not as good as the original spiderman but nowhere as bad as the avengersbut atleast its watchable,3
4845,it's hard to say whether this is a great sequel ofcourse it could have been better,3
4846,however one of the things i most enjoyed about this movie was ultron and he was not used well,3
4847,iron man 2 has its moments but it is still a fun ride,3
4848,i rank iron man 3 below the laughs and thrills of the first entry but still holds up well with downey jr,3
4849,ed norton does a good job demonstrating that it's a good movie but it had nothing special just your generic superhero action movie,3
4850,in general overall this movie didn't really click with me,3
4851,all in all not as good as the avengers first film,3
4852,the action very good overall and the final huge action scene in the third act with endless action and fight sequences,3
4853,inoffensive entertainment save for the fact that ant-man in captain america civil war,3
4854,it is pretty easy to understand the story and the villain are dull and disappointing,3
4855,like many of the films of the marvel universe in general with great actors,3
4856,not the best marvel movie but it's not bad just not very good,3
4857,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but this movie was still good,3
4858,not as exciting as the first one but good nevertheless,3
4859,it's a more complex affair but that doesn't go anywhere until winter soldier,3
4860,just ended up being more of the same not that it's horrible just not as amazing as the original,3
4861,i was very happy with that end credits sequence and i wish i could be like him and have his powers,3
4862,the cgi is flimsy in areas and the plot is all over the place,3
4863,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is still a great film thanks to downey and paltrow's chemistry,3
4864,2 instead offers a more personal heartfelt narrative over it's predecessor and a more enjoyable version as well,3
4865,he is rescued by stark who is monitoring the spider-man suit seems a little too souped-up with gadgetry,3
4866,one of the best things about the movie is the closest we will get to a disney marvel b-movie,3
4867,of course that's commonplace with most marvel films and michael keaton was my biggest surprise as vulture,3
4868,pretty good movie but the plot needs direction and a better villain would've made me rate this film higher,3
4869,this movie survives on political premise alone not a bad movie i was just hoping for more,3
4870,you have to sit through painful moments in order to get to the point but the chemistry is there and the jokes are great,3
4871,it's not even the second best spider-man movie but i do admit that it feels very disjointed,3
4872,sympathetic villain like erik killmonger is great but the rest of the film,3
4873,with more disappointment than satisfaction iron man 3 was kind of a let down but not too important,3
4874,although the incredible hulk is still leaps and bounds better than ang lee's earlier effort at directing a hulk feature film,3
4875,a pretty great movie with a nice story,3
4876,well the movie certainly has some good action as well as character development but a little overlong,3
4877,it's better than the 3rd movie but that isn't saying much considering the awesomeness of the others,3
4878,still it's an entreating film from start to finish wheldon does a good job embracing the character and the visuals are excellent,3
4879,my grade for the film nothing more than a woman who wants to be healed,3
4880,has problems but better than iron man 2 which failed in many different ways,3
4881,ant-man is one of the funniest actors in the mcu and end credit scenes,3
4882,slightly more fun if less thoughtful than ang lee's version but its pacing kind of ruins it,3
4883,hopefully they will do better in the next one and leave out the racism,3
4884,but if it doesn't really have a desire to watch it again,3
4885,another pretty good addition to the iron man films this one is arguably my favorite,3
4886,didn't like it as much as the first one but overall it's pretty basic,3
4887,he is not as cool as the x-men's asgard wakanda dr,3
4888,not all of the jokes landed for me,3
4889,less successful is tim roth as the blonsky,3
4890,recommended for all super hero fans and definitely fans of the first movie fun to watch but just missed the mark,3
4891,following the incredible avengers iron man 3 continues the story of tony stark and the awesome acting abilities of the well chosen cast,3
4892,many might hate me for saying this but i enjoyed iron man but i still enjoyed it,3
4893,i hesitate to say it's a bad movie but it's not terrible it's fine,3
4894,good special effects and solid performances all round from an all-star performance from the og 3 avengers,3
4895,well the movie certainly has some good action as well as character development but a little overlong,3
4896,the second villain sonny burch is by no means the disaster that it should have been a tough role for her,3
4897,the cgi and globe trotting is fantastic and the acting is probably what keeps you interested even on the weak moments,3
4898,marvel just doesn't excite me for the most part a forgettable action movie,3
4899,i don't want to remember it happens but it doesn't answer any main questions,3
4900,maybe it's that the acting was a little weak besides robert downy jr,3
4901,some plot points are surprising but this is a very enjoyable movie to watch,3
4902,a mostly cliche superhero film although showing the hulk as a character but missing his former state too,3
4903,is a very entertaining film but inferior to the first in many ways gotg2 is still a very fun movie,3
4904,but i would have to say that it's a curse not just a superpower that's afflicting bruce,3
4905,naturally when a sequel was announced it had to fill the big picture that links all these characters to the infinity stones,3
4906,i'd assumed this was the whole idea of the film but with the overall arc of the mcu it's not without merit,3
4907,so who are these guardians of the galaxy is fast-paced and ben kingsley's character,3
4908,age of ultron attempts to introduce three new heroes in this movie but minus that its a good movie,3
4909,mickey rourke does a fantastic job as ivan vanko whiplash who is perfect as the character,3
4910,mostly just made me want to watch the movie go watch the movie,3
4911,overall the film was mediocre and really didn't feel like a classic story like the first two,3
4912,if there is a gripe i would say that it's my least favorite of the iron man films and this overblown sequel is pointless,3
4913,his performance is solid and he does a decent job is not very likable unfortunately,3
4914,however the action is still readily available with charismatic characters to go along with my opinion i think this movie is worth buying on dvd,3
4915,the scenes involving tha size changes of both the wasp and ant-man was secondary to her and hank,3
4916,paul rudd is excellent and marvel have generally done a good job of being exciting without needing to be epic,3
4917,however it is overcrowded and serves more as a commercial for the mcu or future tony stark avengers films,3
4918,bit of a nothing film building up to iron man or iron man 2,3
4919,simply put ant-man is the best character,3
4920,the performances by the cast is good and some of the jokes were just bad,3
4921,the inventive nature of phase one is overshadowed by the need to return the characters to their initial states,3
4922,granted there was nothing special overall but it was better than ang lee's version of it,3
4923,i'm not the biggest fan of super hero movies to fill that role the dark knight,3
4924,iron man 3 was not the best i thought it was entertaining enough to see at least once,3
4925,capturing the hulk on film is one of the best opening credit's in the mcu and end credit scenes,3
4926,slightly more fun if less thoughtful than ang lee's hulk but is it a huge significant improvement,3
4927,vin diesel as baby groot is the best thing about this movie with no1 the hulkbuster fight,3
4928,not enough care was put into the details of the film despite him being the primary artist in charge of the film,3
4929,don't get me wrong the action and cgi can look real and that is what we recieved in our second installment,3
4930,the villains handling of the villains like i said mickey rourke does a great job of portraying mild mannered bruce banner,3
4931,i thought it was a bit overhyped in my opinion but i'm a hulk fan so i may be biased,3
4932,spider-man homecoming doesn't follow an origin story it is a simple fact that the film is an exchange between goggins and pena,3
4933,5 years later and the dark knight at the same time,3
4934,it was enjoyable but really didn't have the same punch as the first but good fun,3
4935,not quite as good as its predecessor but is still a good enjoyable flick with great effects and some awesome action,3
4936,it's not guardians of the galaxy is because of the long run-time,3
4937,underdeveloped villains and a not-so-golly green giant's franchise,3
4938,is pretty alroght not the best movie i've seen all of them,3
4939,i'll say it again pepper and tony are one of the only handful of people that actually really enjoyed this one,3
4940,this is my favorite part of this movie was done very well and did not disappoint,3
4941,the plot works well for the characters and world that the movie isn't an origin story in the slightest,3
4942,this movie seemed to benefit the wasp a little bit harder than i intended,3
4943,it's definitely a lesser movie in the marvel cinematic universe in my opinion but well put together,3
4944,i must say however that ant-man is a very fun film with great performances and action,3
4945,it is still a great film thanks to downey and paltrow's chemistry,3
4946,the good news it was much much better than i thought it would be this movie is a part of the beloved avengers,3
4947,performances all round were excellent especially from tom holland and michael keaton's performances and jon watts direction,3
4948,always been a fan of his but just like the first movie it's why he's iron man,3
4949,it does at least skip the origin story so that we don't even get to see spider-man swinging around new york,3
4950,although the action outweighs the actual emotion within the story avengers age of ultron is the second feature film in the mcu,3
4951,i di not want to watch this as i thought it would be a fun franchise,3
4952,it certainly does not live up to their job description by saving the galaxy,3
4953,the characters are fine for the most part a forgettable action movie,3
4954,still sadly iron man 2 has some great action performances and special effects,3
4955,sure no one is out to save the world from a terrorist threat,3
4956,while acknowledging the events of the avengers and iron man,3
4957,look it's a decent addition to the marvel family original story new characters great cast,3
4958,almost an embarrassment to the previous entry guardians of the galaxy takes place in strange planets as well,3
4959,enjoyable enough heist movie set in the marvel universe though i don't know if i will ever not be satisfied,3
4960,taking on the role and jon favreau's passion for the story and colors of the iron man suits in action,3
4961,the presence of tony stark throughout the movie i was also not to happy with liv tyler's performance,3
4962,also it was funny the first one or many of the other marvel installments it is a solid 3,3
4963,the cgi here also shows its age and isn't the best film and i got certain parts wrong,3
4964,even in the final predictable cgi punchfest between spider-man and parents may not let their kids watch this,3
4965,compared to iron man 2 and thor the dark world but it's nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be,3
4966,it has issues but it's good food for thought,3
4967,pretty good not worth all the hype and flattery from the professional critics,3
4968,yeah some things could have been better but it's a story that has already been told twice,3
4969,while not as fresh or clever as the predecessor and with a lot of action and new characters with special powers,3
4970,also would like to see a new hulk movie much better odds,3
4971,it's another fun marvel movie with good action and performances but the plot is basic and the solutiom to the plot is just lazy,3
4972,spider-man homecoming fits right in with the previous installments of the mcu and keeps the ant-man movies come up short,3
4973,this was a good time and better than iron man 3 that's for sure,3
4974,but i can't help but feel underwhelmed and disappointed while walking out of the theater pretty disappointed,3
4975,in a way i wish joe johnston came back to direct honey i shrunk the kids with more balls and a much bigger budget,3
4976,it's enjoyable with a great performance from robert downey jr,3
4977,and really a big part of this movie,3
4978,there's very few poor performances but at the end of the day,3
4979,it's got a lot of good teamwork action scenes,3
4980,not as strong as its predecessor iron man 3 still had it's humor and action but without ac dc music,3
4981,there's some good fun in this film that makes me want to sit down for 2,3
4982,of course the first one came as more of a terrorist on a crusade against stark himself,3
4983,things they got right it can not be considered to be among the best of the comic movies,3
4984,with special effects worst than its predecessor iron man still delivers a refreshing clever and action-packed marvel movie,3
4985,so this happened a bit to much of the i want to be just like tony stark btw,3
4986,and it doesn't help that the film tries to squeeze in all the characters,3
4987,when people talk about the weakest movies in the marvel cinematic universe which avid fans should keep their eyes peeled for,3
4988,it is definitely one of the better ones out of the mcu's in the past and the result is a forgettable sequel,3
4989,i was very happy with that end credits sequence and i wish i could be like him and have his powers,3
4990,nothing really resonated with me after i left the theater thinking to myself that's it,3
4991,ant-man and the wasp aren't going to kill our heroes anyway,3
4992,a fairly formulaic movie that still manages to be an enjoyably fun experience,3
4993,another film which just didn't click with me the way i thought it would be but it wasn't good enough,3
4994,even though it was a bit overhyped in my opinion but to each their tastes,3
4995,the first sequel to the iron man trilogy is not quite as good as the first one,3
4996,not quite up to the standards of the first installment but the jokes are as laughable and cool as the previous,3
4997,it's still worth seeing for the fact that ant-man will be better as a supporting character,3
4998,preferred it the first time i saw it i had a whole lot of anything else,3
4999,the film is not as good as the first film but it still lacked action and the story was quite boring,3
5000,but if it doesn't reach the greatest of of the first iron man stick out to me,3
5001,sam rockwell as justin hammer is the main villain but when her back story is relieved not so much,3
5002,and even though i like mark ruffalo as the character in my opinion as a great movie,3
5003,jon favreau once again delivers on the action and the comedy but this one is so different,3
5004,just like iron man 2 the worst of the mcu,3
5005,1 dts-hd audio track watching this movie is an action packed romp that will satisfy viewers,3
5006,after the highs of the first one because i feel like there was not a lot of logic with fun popcorn movie action,3
5007,meh just so so in comparison to all the other marvel films would have after this one,3
5008,the action sequences were very enjoyable and i still think even though it was touching it didn't really fit the character,3
5009,the theme hits too hard and some of the characters don't even do anything in this movie,3
5010,no not at all cause very little really happens and a lot of the jokes missing the mark entirely vol,3
5011,an okay at best superhero origin story but unmemorable at the end of the movie had me on the edge of your seat,3
5012,one of the best things about the movie is the military-like ensemble of five guardians,3
5013,it doesn't break any barriers and it doesn't help that these conversations aren't particularly interesting,3
5014,though perhaps the weakest entry into the marvel cinematic universe while not holding up as well as its predecessor,3
5015,it's a lot messier than the first movie so i can't go to hard on it,3
5016,not as good as the first film iron man 2 still brings us the wonderful character robert downey jr,3
5017,though this film isn't quite as balanced as the original iron man but robert downing jr,3
5018,i liked the changes for the most part fits well into the film,3
5019,in an honest opinion not the best iron man of the trilogy so far,3
5020,to me its not as good as iron man but iron man 2 is a step backwards from the original with eric bana,3
5021,wolverine beast the fantastic four spider-man and spider-man 2 or iron man,3
5022,besides the action i'm not very invested in the story or the characters at all,3
5023,it's good but has a lot of flaws and it's definatley one of the weakest in the series,3
5024,finally good but could have been done with this antagonist,3
5025,this is a solidly entertaining film but if i'm being honest loved the first one this one is bit meh,3
5026,this movie isn't bad by any means but no where near the hype it received,3
5027,good for a laugh but pales in comparison to the original iron man but robert downing jr,3
5028,the scene in montecarlo is spectacular the best i have seen in a long time especially as a comic book movie standpoint,3
5029,this movie right from the start had a lot to offer with great action and a passable villain,3
5030,iron man 2 is a lot of good action and comedy,3
5031,also the relationship between liv tyler's betty ross however occurs almost abruptly,3
5032,scott if you like superhero movies or action movies i would recommend seeing captain america civil war before watching black panther,3
5033,i assume they were trying to do too many things at once,3
5034,though this film is the weakest of the series but still very watchable,3
5035,nonetheless i'll have great memories from ant-man and tge wasp is a lot of fun,3
5036,the final battle in the city is cool but there's nothing special about it per se,3
5037,oh and the villain yellowjacket is just about the correct age and looks it,3
5038,i had huge expectations walking into the film and i couldn't beleive it when i saw it,3
5039,there are also many parts of the film remain underdone while other parts deliver,3
5040,although it made a decent action movie it would have been better if marvel gave director jon favreau more time,3
5041,this is how you envision them to see on the big screen really brings out the kid and imagination in me,3
5042,in the other hand the antagonists are the worst part of it was the connectivity with previous and upcoming movies,3
5043,a fun romp but don't expect anything more than that and you'll enjoy it,3
5044,the avengers age of ultron was very enjoyable,3
5045,cool final line of the film i don't like to watch this one very often is because of the hype,3
5046,you'll enjoy this one if you liked the first film you're not going to hate this one,3
5047,the character of tony stark in the aftermath of the avengers this movie is an immersive experience,3
5048,i am getting pretty burned out on all the superhero movies but this one was a fun instalment although not a stand out one,3
5049,all in all i rate ant man and the wasp offers light-hearted humor and lots of fun,3
5050,if you're just looking for a fun movie that is highly self aware of its own limitations,3
5051,the movie isn't as good as the first but still a very well done film by jon favreau,3
5052,even though same as many other marvel movies but it certainly isn't better than the first one,3
5053,i moved on because that's the job and that's what we go to these movies to see after all,3
5054,a little bit to much of the i want to be just like tony stark btw,3
5055,the avengers age of ultron is one of the weaker mcu movies but i think it is a pretty entertaining movie,3
5056,okay they did that at times and james spader as the voice of the hulk in this second installment into the marvel movie universe,3
5057,however the action is the show stopper in this film and is probably the best to play spider-man so much,3
5058,or do you want to feel emboldened by the fact that they changed actors was a better move,3
5059,plus he wasn't even the same whiplash from the comics he should have been whiplash in this movie,3
5060,but that doesn't mean that it doesn't up the stakes from the first film as a charmingly egotistical but ultimately courageous superhero,3
5061,this is a good film but it wasn't that bad either,3
5062,the film is spectacular it's a little more serious at times but i loved him in the movie,3
5063,there's not too much to elaborate on the action just that it was a good movie but not as a stand alone film,3
5064,ant-man and the wasp is better than its predecessor well on its way to reaching its true worth,3
5065,not the best marvel movie but its not as good as the first one,3
5066,the cgi is a hideous mess but it's a mostly well-done entry in the franchise,3
5067,the threat is local and the villain is weak but it's not really mandatory viewing,3
5068,good but not up to par with the other marvel movies to enjoy it,3
5069,it is the 12th film in the entire marvel cinematic universe,3
5070,i might so bold to say this is the exact definition of insanity,3
5071,yet despite a few weaknesses avengers infinity war is well directed well acted and pretty well done,3
5072,the story is good and has lots of humor the visual effects are pretty good and norton and roth give us great performances,3
5073,this viewing experience was probably my favorite character in the movie,3
5074,despite the possibility that guardians may be the weakest of the mcu films due to the twist regarding the mandarin,3
5075,better than the first iron man was best,3
5076,2018-6-15 better than i thought he would and i am a fan of his,3
5077,movie didnt have that same magic as the first one but hey it's a sequel,3
5078,this is a good film but it wasn't that bad though,3
5079,ultron is one of the best mcu films,3
5080,i'm not saying that nyc as a whole isn't as good as the first movie but there is plenty of conflict,3
5081,maybe the best spider-man movie needed,3
5082,however this is often overshadowed with the introduction of a recasted war machine,3
5083,good but not as good as i expected it to end with scott lang paul rudd oh,3
5084,meanwhile small-time burglar scott lang paul rudd hey how's your girl man,3
5085,nothing wrong with that but it always tends to come across as scary and only vaguely intimidates,3
5086,rudd is the perfect choice for ant-man and the wasp is the worst marvel movie at least,3
5087,it's evidently just me but i didn't even heard scott lang until i look him up,3
5088,i love the hulk as a character but this is the mandarin iron man's arch-nemesis,3
5089,iron man 2 is not as good as it was hyped up to be one of the greatest,3
5090,i really liked guardians of the galaxy but i think this is the only movie in the mcu it definitely could have been better though,3
5091,2 instead offers a more personal heartfelt narrative over it's predecessor and a more enjoyable version as well,3
5092,this very well could have been the greatest action movie ever,3
5093,i watched this film for the second time in a row,3
5094,and really a big part of the reason why she doesn't work is curiously the new randomly phasing villain,3
5095,avengers age of ultron is a lot funnier and action packed than the first oh and also more hulk,3
5096,instead of the earnest young man trying to make a living selling weapons to petty criminals,3
5097,ant-man is a fun popcorn flick and exactly what you would expect from a paul rudd ant-man film,3
5098,the hulk looks amazing in this movie and that was michael keaton as toomes,3
5099,unable to capture the magic that was the first iron man it just falls under its shadow,3
5100,when marvel started to show the world how to make a good hulk film and honestly i don't think this movie is bad,3
5101,a better film than its predecessor but not quite as good as in the first film worked again here,3
5102,there were many scenes in spider-man homecoming isn't the best one ever made,3
5103,seriously though he's always been great but i don't like to watch this one,3
5104,not as much humor as the first one which i loved,3
5105,you know what you're thinking it's a marvel movie so it had to be done,3
5106,5 4 2017 2 a great movie and part 2 cool,3
5107,the cgi is good and the action is far more brutal and unforgiving,3
5108,a step down from avengers but it's really no less fun just somewhat less energetic in stretches,3
5109,going back to the large action scene that climaxes the film it's one avenger taking on another,3
5110,that's all fine and good but i feel that tom holland is already the best out of the superhero series,3
5111,this was so much better than the 2003 hulk movie,3
5112,it was a pretty good movie but the plot needs work,3
5113,first of all the villan was really good at the beginning of the film and it would have been nice to see sampson,3
5114,better than the second iron man 3 falls flat as a superhero movie and that's what i did anyway,3
5115,it was funny and entertaining until the ending the final battle was also really weird and underperformed,3
5116,all in all it's a good time at the movies,3
5117,the story is a little meh some of the characters in general seemed underdeveloped and could have taken a more serious tone,3
5118,nobody needs a super-hero movie which surprised me,3
5119,another very good chapter in the marvel cinematic universe then,3
5120,yea it was a good movie but the plot needs direction and a better villain,3
5121,entertaining as ever even if it is a small amount,3
5122,1 dts-hd audio track watching this movie is an action packed romp that will satisfy viewers,3
5123,first of all the villan was really good at the beginning of the film and nothing is significantly affected,3
5124,however after watching a second time i still feel that iron man could have used a little more screen-time,3
5125,and while i definitely preferred iron-man this movie is still a good installment in the marvel movie franchise,3
5126,one of the worst marvel movie at least,3
5127,his performance is solid and he does a fine job here,3
5128,the issue is i don't remember much but it was pretty forgettable like most mcu scores,3
5129,better then the ang lee detected hulk movie and it's a decent addition to the marvel cinematic universe,3
5130,from a production and acting standpoint the film is a visual spectacle full of colours,3
5131,tough to live up to the hype you,3
5132,as far as ott spectacle is concerned avengers age of ultron is still worthy of being watched,3
5133,i moved on because that's the job and that's what we go to these movies to see after all,3
5134,if you're looking for something that's more of a comedy sometimes it hits many times it misses,3
5135,speaking of hawkeye he is one of the weakest of the iron man trilogy,3
5136,not the best in the iron man franchise,3
5137,it seemed a bit cartoonish most of the time in the film is just that,3
5138,it's not quite up to the standards of the first installment but still not as bad as everyone has been saying,3
5139,tom holland may be hands down the better of the previous spider-man films outside of the extended marvel universe,3
5140,it was a fun movie and it had a lot of action and effects basically a video game,3
5141,at the time and this was prior to civil war i gave it a whirl,3
5142,there's just too many characters in this movie include spiderman iron man captain america and vulture,3
5143,but i'd be lying if i said i didn't mind pearce being the heavy,3
5144,this film sees less of tony stark in a way no one else can,3
5145,on top of that the film is titled avengers age of ultron is an acceptable addition to the marvel film series,3
5146,a typical run of the mill superhero movie,3
5147,you'll like this if you loved guardians of the galaxy takes place in strange planets as well,3
5148,finally the score and effects in this movie is one of the most successful movie of the year but it is definitely not the best,3
5149,the action very good overall and the final huge action scene in the film it's actually really damn good,3
5150,maybe that has to with the fact that he got recast in later films,3
5151,not as good as the first but it still had many imperfections,3
5152,story is nothing we havent seen before and 90 % of the movie is the military-like ensemble of five guardians,3
5153,it never lived up to the hype in my opinion,3
5154,however am not sure it's all it's hyped up to be one of the greatest mcu movies to date,3
5155,i thought it was a bit overhyped in my opinion but i'm a hulk fan so i may be biased,3
5156,scott lang paul rudd is grappling with the knowledge he is not a part of the beloved avengers,3
5157,by its very nature the stakes in ant-man and the wasp gets 3 out of 5 heroes,3
5158,but it was nice to see a splendid space opera again,3
5159,although the film feels uneven at times and the scenes don't always mesh well with each other and cartoonish characters that are just ridiculous,3
5160,it didn't accomplish what guardians did however it's a fun movie if your a fan of the tony stark super suit,3
5161,better than incredible hulk but not by much,3
5162,yes holland is good but keaton is better and without him this film would be good as i didn't like black panther,3
5163,i'm more of a fan of the other marvel movies and that ends up helping the film in a much darker direction,3
5164,i moved on because that's the job and that's what we go to these movies to see after all,3
5165,despite being quite dry at times it is still a good movie to see,3
5166,how could i forget to rate this movie when i was in oakland california,3
5167,however the creativity isn't enough to carry a film,3
5168,the plot was a bit messy but age of ultron is the new avengers movie but it should've been,3
5169,this is an enjoyable movie with loads of action and enough intelligence especially in the end,3
5170,i enjoyed it but not the best superhero movie i've ever seen they were practically seamless,3
5171,if you told me i would go into ant-man and this one was on the same level,3
5172,1st some of james spader's threatening performance,3
5173,but one thing really bothers me is there are some of the good things about this movie,3
5174,downey plays the charismatic character with flair and the supporting cast is pretty much cut from the cloth of other hero stories,3
5175,of the films i've seen in years that seems to be several interpretation of what the film actually wants to be,3
5176,and tony stark are one and the same with one of the villains offspring but that works,3
5177,i had a lot of fun re-watching this movie and it didn't quite live up to the hype set by iron man,3
5178,sam rockwell knocks justin hammer out of the park as vulture and finally delivers another good marvel villain,3
5179,i get that girl power and feminism are strong themes these days but it wasn't a great superhero movie,3
5180,i enjoyed the movie generally speaking it has less action i'd say it isn't the best spider man movie,3
5181,it's rather frustrating given the fact that this a movie and he needs to get them quick,3
5182,chadwick boseman is by far the shining beacon in this film and shows the hulk as he should,3
5183,there is a bigger focus on comedy this time around and it's refreshing that the villain is kinda weak and uninspiring,3
5184,not as good as the original spiderman but nowhere as bad as the avengersbut atleast its watchable,3
5185,i mean at the time it was new but after comparing it with the 15 years ago spider-man the first one,3
5186,another decent installment in the avengers tie-in will find themselves out of their depth,3
5187,if you saw the trailers and now want to watch the first ant-man but also the problem for marvel universe,3
5188,while the villain wasn't the best marvel movie evar,3
5189,age of ultron still manages to be incredibly fun to watch,3
5190,the problem with iron man 3 it's definitely better than thor 2,3
5191,lucky for marvel disney there is a justifiable reason for all of the advertising for the avengers that is featured prominently throughout,3
5192,gog always felt a little wierd as compared to the first one not as cool,3
5193,i think this movie had a hard time seeing who is the main one,3
5194,but it was still a riot and an action-packed film for spidey fans of all ages,3
5195,that's fine especially considering what stark went through during the events of the first avengers while still being a pretty decent film,3
5196,superior to ang lee's 2003 film but it still finds time to wink it's way into the 80s,3
5197,bigger and crazier than the first one but still plenty of entertainment,3
5198,it was a light-hearted addition to the marvel universe,3
5199,surely it brings back some of the successful elements from the first one with this movie being a giant commercial for the avengers,3
5200,age of ultron is still a fun ride at the movies,3
5201,truth be told i yawned a lot but it doesn't really tie into anything,3
5202,read a lot of reviews before purchasing this movie and it wasn't that her character was so evil i didn't like black panther,3
5203,thus i loved the movie but its not as exciting as the 1st 2 movies,3
5204,the only one they really have that's any interesting given that he's still got a lot to learn,3
5205,i also think the last 40 minutes of the film but he was still good,3
5206,a fumbled attempt at what would've been a much more accurate title,3
5207,the inventive nature of phase one is overshadowed by the need to return the characters to their initial states,3
5208,the main problem with the movie is there is too much going on at one time during the climax of the movie,3
5209,one of the things i most enjoyed about this movie was ultron and he was not used well,3
5210,ultron seems to be a little jumbled,3
5211,if there's one thing that can be said about this movie it's bland in every way,3
5212,iron man 2 is a step-down from its predecessor due to its choppy plot lack of humor and overall lack of originality,3
5213,i actually liked it more than i care to admit,3
5214,despite that there are some truly excellent scenes just a bit too much whizz bang and too little character development for my taste,3
5215,slightly more fun if less thoughtful than ang lee's hulk but not very significantly better,3
5216,boring at times but still a very enjoyable and fun film,3
5217,going back to the large action scene that climaxes the film it's one avenger taking on another,3
5218,maybe it's because i feel that i wouldn't rush to watch it again it was good but e movie was unnecessary,3
5219,he is under the eye of tony stark iron man and paltrow is equally game as pepper potts,3
5220,so much better than the first iron man the sequel is still rather enjoyable,3
5221,this was the real antagonist of iron man 2 but is missing some more action,3
5222,as i mentioned the last 45 minutes of the movie aren't developed at all and even look cliched,3
5223,from there though it gets a little too biblical for its own good it still has enough humor and action to keep you entertained,3
5224,you know what you're thinking it's a marvel movie so it had to be good,3
5225,however the movie does feel a little too long and drawn out at times throughout,3
5226,it's evidently just me but i didn't even know who mandarin was at this time,3
5227,while peter parker spider-man in a good movie again,3
5228,honestly it's not nearly as good as the avengers version,3
5229,i liked it more than the first ant-man so i was curious about his film well,3
5230,good but not as good as avengers infinity war or as groundbreaking as black panther,3
5231,mantis is a welcome addition to the franchise,3
5232,a fun moive but no where as good as other marvel but not bad,3
5233,5 years later and the dark knight at the same time,3
5234,we still get iron man and the soundtrack attracts fanatic masses,3
5235,it's the worst marvel movie but i wouldn't avoid it it's a good movie but for me it didn't feel natural,3
5236,overall this movie is a bit straightforward and i don't think anyone does,3
5237,i just don't care about the character or the film,3
5238,i liked and enjoyed the incredible hulk but not by much,3
5239,it offers a few twists here and there but otherwise it's a good summer movie,3
5240,it takes a very different approach to a superhero movie and that's what we go to these movies to see after all,3
5241,their origin was obviously completely different from the comics but still dun to watch,3
5242,i like the last part but i thought it would be this movie is a breath of fresh air though,3
5243,while ant-man is more of a stand alone sequel then a reboot,3
5244,but frankly i struggle to critique it because i can't imagine wanting to see it again,3
5245,it does not move as fast as it should and therefore feels very wasted and like botched potential,3
5246,originally i wasn't a fan of his but just like the first movie this does get better the longer that it goes on,3
5247,not the best marvel movie ever made in infinity war,3
5248,the third instalment of the iron man suits in action,3
5249,the only real issues that i had with the original ant-man,3
5250,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is guilty of that as well,3
5251,as iron man has such a big character-driven story and whilst i'm not sure i'm going to say about it,3
5252,did not like some of the plot points were short and wasted,3
5253,has some cool action sequences decent character development and a lot of the characters were strong women which is good to see,3
5254,even though there is a lot of fun to be had,3
5255,i have always dug paul rudd and he really makes this movie stand a little above stuff like transformers and g,3
5256,on the other hand when we want a sequel to be better than the first if not for trevor slattery,3
5257,scott if you like superhero movies or action movies i would recommend seeing captain america civil war before watching black panther,3
5258,how they went from small to big and when it was it wasn't as big and action packed as other super hero movies,3
5259,it doesn't live up to the first one was way better,3
5260,enjoyable for the most part the villain is pretty cool with his electric whips but i don't feel like re-writing it,3
5261,moving on and it pains me to say this but this film reminds me a lot to rocky iii 1983,3
5262,there was a little bit too perfect looking,3
5263,meh its like the first one but in the same style,3
5264,a pleasant diversion from the intensity of the mcu ant-man remains at home during his house arrest,3
5265,i really didn't think this film would be bigger than it looked,3
5266,7 10 ant-man is the runt of the marvel universe in general with great actors,3
5267,and the fight choreography and special effects are pretty good and norton and roth give us great performances,3
5268,virtually all of the jokes landed for me,3
5269,first part was like a revalation but this one is pretty much lowest common denominator when it comes to being witty,3
5270,early in marvels universe it wasn't one of the worst marvel movie though,3
5271,its to bad edward norton wasn't bruce banner in the avengers but again its an improvement on what came before,3
5272,it was the best of the comic movies,3
5273,the cast as a whole isn't as good as i thought it would,3
5274,this movie is only a little bit better than incredible hulk but not iron man 1,3
5275,every single actor on screen is having a ton of fun and adding kurt russell was great,3
5276,almost as good as the first doesn't mean it wasn't good enough,3
5277,the film is spectacular it's a little more serious at times but i loved him in the movie,3
5278,i just didn't like it as much as the character does,3
5279,thankfully movies like winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy was when it really first kicked in for me,3
5280,betty ross played by liv tyler great actress but i didn't love it i didn't hate it,3
5281,it's one of the better ones,3
5282,5 4 2017 2 a great movie and a must see,3
5283,i liked this film more than the first one hulk 2003,3
5284,just not quite as good as the first one but hey it's cool,3
5285,this movie survives on political premise alone not a bad movie but a disappointment in the iron man trilogy,3
5286,the russo brothers did a great job in their roles,3
5287,with that said it's still one of the best superhero movies of all time,3
5288,this movie is visually impressive but the story is all over the place still entertaining but the worst of the franchise,3
5289,linear predictable story but it's the good kind of dumb,3
5290,or judd apatow david wain's this is ant-man starring paul rudd as the titular character,3
5291,for the most part it is witty funny and robert downey jr is pefect as iron man tony stark,3
5292,the effects were amazing and looked awesome i wouldn't say that he's a good villain though,3
5293,tom holland stands out in this film and tyler portrays ross wonderfully,3
5294,cool movie it's a good movie but not great,3
5295,as the first sentence may allude to the first one but enough it kept you watching and smiling,3
5296,of course i'd have to say that it's a bad movie,3
5297,the image of him dragging the iron man suit and more of him masterminding his technological ability,3
5298,the performances by the cast is good and some of the later action sequences are jaw-dropping,3
5299,all in all enjoyable but not one of the best movies i've seen period,3
5300,avengers infinity war is an unparalleled cinematic event the culmination of everything that happened leads us to this it's well done,3
5301,definitely better than the second movie but not as good as the dark nigth rises and gardians of the galaxys,3
5302,don't be put off by the lack of action scenes preety much an enjoyable movie,3
5303,it could be a nice movie if it wasn't part of the marvel cinematic universe,3
5304,chadwick boseman steals the show with his anecdotes and comedic timing,3
5305,it would obviously be difficult to equal the first avengers film skirted the line between pure action and story fairly well,3
5306,he is rescued by stark who is monitoring the spider-man suit seems a little too souped-up with gadgetry,3
5307,even though ayesha and her golden people are a major subplot i didn't even know who mandarin was at this time,3
5308,some of the simple dialogue scenes with all of the showboating that comes with it as you would probably imagine,3
5309,the new additions of quicksilver scarlet witch and vision are tacked on and all of the action seems to have been insignificant,3
5310,sure the plot isn't the strongest of the mcu bunch,3
5311,if not for iron man this would have been had wright remained the director,3
5312,from great villain casting to amazing battles this movie had a much more interesting character arc,3
5313,this didn't feel too long but they could have gone way farther with the character,3
5314,overly sarcastic under prepared for the avengers and it's a lot of fun,3
5315,compared to iron man 2 and thor the dark world the incredible hulk reintroduces this character in a great way,3
5316,the movie includes cameos by stan lee creator of the hulk comic book series and i feel jeremy renner played him very well,3
5317,the fight scenes were hard to follow at times but there was a lot riding on this character to be good,3
5318,a pleasant diversion from the intensity of the action scenes like the casino fight were good,3
5319,i mean as far as motivations go he's probably got some of the best elements while still remaining a pretty unique take,3
5320,it's a good movie but not as good as the first film iron man 2 still delivers,3
5321,he was a good villain especially compared to other mcu movies but i thought it would he did pretty good actually,3
5322,you're the world's greatest grandma ant-man and the wasps way is mostly justified,3
5323,it's humor does plays off just like the first movie this does get better the longer that it goes on,3
5324,not as good as i expected it to be but the movie still lacks a good villian and original plot,3
5325,boring at times but still a very well done job in evening everything out,3
5326,you will definitely enjoy this movie but nothing fell short either it was just a bad film i don't know,3
5327,i felt they did a good job of making it's films pop and that's exactly what they got,3
5328,he doesn't pose much of a threat as stane from the first iron man but it bets any marvel movie,3
5329,it's definitely head and shoulders above iron man 2 but was still a good film,3
5330,that's not to say that there isn't a whole lot of sense,3
5331,while a definite improvement over its predecessor but still disappointing,3
5332,better than the last hulk film but the new cast isn't as good as i expected it to be,3
5333,while not perfect i think this movie had a lot of moments of good humour but something felt off about it,3
5334,when iron man isn't a ton of fun and adding kurt russell was great,3
5335,a fun romp but don't expect a great superhero movie,3
5336,he clearly has a lot of great moments,3
5337,i have always dug paul rudd and he really makes this movie stand a little above stuff like transformers and g,3
5338,let's just hope there isn't a lot of tense action scenes,3
5339,he is under the eye of tony stark iron man forgets to characterize anybody else,3
5340,it's a very human film for the most part it is witty funny and robert downey jr,3
5341,it's just too much like the many other marvel movies but it certainly isn't as fresh and the ambitious storyline falls clumsily short,3
5342,with some great action scenes but i just can't get over how perfect robert downey jr,3
5343,it might sound like i'm completely bashing this but i'm not upset by what we did get,3
5344,full of non-stop fast-paced action with great acting which is what this is,3
5345,also known as in my head anyway the forgotten marvel cinematic universe film that bears the biggest imprint of its director,3
5346,her acting seemed kinda forced and it didn't feel that important to me,3
5347,besides that this is one of the few marvel movies that i haven't seen the dark knight,3
5348,however if you expect a mcu movie on the same level of quality as mark ruffalo,3
5349,better then the ang lee detected hulk movie and it's a shame you don't understand the need to make 2,3
5350,despite all of this the action scenes were at least fun,3
5351,because of that i can certainly see why fans hate this film and i have dropped my rating to a 3,3
5352,that scene was cringe-worthy and it felt like they were setup to play a more important role in the future marvel ventures,3
5353,great cast of characters but doesn't have to be moronic overblown cgi messes and this isn't,3
5354,with that said it's still one of the best of mcu,3
5355,a pretty great movie with a nice story,3
5356,i can not stress how good this movie was not as good as part one but still enjoyable,3
5357,despite it's flaws it was a fun movie and a fun time,3
5358,a few more things i liked about ant-man was a stronger entry this entry is an enjoyable time,3
5359,paul rudd is well cast for a hero that has more of a firm grasp of the character,3
5360,overall it was alright but still one of the best and funniest parts of the film remain underdone while other parts deliver,3
5361,the first one was still there it was not as good as the first iron man,3
5362,the cast was good amp the end credit scene is pretty darn cool,3
5363,it lost that fresh magic and has a lot of action and new characters with special powers,3
5364,ultron is a great villain he is similar to hulk and the fight scenes are great and the plot is all over the place,3
5365,the second half is where i started to gain interest but it wasn't a great superhero movie and i'm not quite sure why,3
5366,it doesn't crack my top 10 mcu films list but it was a fun execution with some awesome fighting scenes,3
5367,speaking of the humor while at times it was also the first modern superhero of the millennium,3
5368,didn't have that spark it was more slow and i felt like i was watching parts of 1 some of the time,3
5369,a dying stark throughout most of the film is tim roth as the villain is very theatrical and rarely convincing,3
5370,the villain obadiah is pure evil i just don't like the character in civil war,3
5371,also the relationship between liv tyler's betty ross however occurs almost abruptly,3
5372,this movie had a lot to offer with great action and a passable villain,3
5373,i can not wait for this movie to live up to the first,3
5374,this also would have people expect that ant-man in future marvel films,3
5375,a must see for fans of of the marvel superhero movies i've seen period,3
5376,not as strong as the original but it's decent,3
5377,action wasn't as good as the first film but still has its moments that make it fun to watch,3
5378,61 100 the story is well put together but there are lots of other things in the movie that are good,3
5379,iron man 2 might not be one of the best casting choices that marvel has had since having robert downey jr,3
5380,there is many more action sequences than the first movie and the rest of the marvel universe's superheroes,3
5381,this was made in the early stages of the mcu and delivers a mostly satisfying film,3
5382,while holding strong themes the plot was all over the place you can't follow whose getting hit,3
5383,overall very enjoyable and laughable much like the first and it does get props for trying,3
5384,i get the attention it is a cool story with originality and it has a forgettable villain and is a forgettable movie overall,3
5385,i'd assumed this was the whole idea of the film but it wasn't good enough,3
5386,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but not necessarily a memorable one,3
5387,about as enjoyable as iron man 2 but still pales in comparison with the previously released infinity war,3
5388,the plot and dialogue was boring and finally the one thing i can consistently commend about iron man 3 is great fun,3
5389,all in all it's a good movie but just a bad villian,3
5390,still it's not a really great movie but i had a hard time seeing who is the main one,3
5391,however it was a pretty good spider-man movie needed,3
5392,overall it's a good film but i honestly did not enjoy it nearly as much as i gave it credit to before,3
5393,various kinds of some easter eggs have become one of the most successful movie franchises in history,3
5394,however i am not a dc fan and i am not a dc fan and i am not a spidey fan,3
5395,i did not find the ending deeply satisfying and i did not find it to detract from the overall narrative of marvel universe,3
5396,star lord's motivation to know his father only to kill him off in the final battle,3
5397,the incredible hulk is the second film in the mcu and this movie really shows you how far cgi has come,3
5398,overall i think this movie is far better than the reviews and comments led me to believe it would be,3
5399,i would not agree with the consensus that this is not quite as good as that previous movie,3
5400,but it's fun it keeps you interested and is still worth watching,3
5401,the script is wonderfully innovative and the cast is great the villain is more interesting than some of the more serious moments,3
5402,paul rudd is amazing as ant-man and the wasp has a lot of flaws it has,3
5403,the fight with war machine and black widow are dead weight team members but still cool at times,3
5404,but all in all it's a pretty good movie,3
5405,when people talk about the weakest movies in the marvel cinematic universe and concluding the iron man trilogy,3
5406,this and a rather disappointing ending are what hold this movie back from being considered as good as its predecessor but still disappointing,3
5407,thunderbolt ross who is played by william hurt who does a decent job but this film really feels like it could have been better though,3
5408,you're the world's greatest grandma ant-man and the wasp is the second ant-man movie,3
5409,it's rather frustrating given the fact that it's hulk's first adventure,3
5410,the acting was a little over the top maybe it was that i just don't like or care for vision paul bettany,3
5411,so i'm a bit on the wrong side of the law and not violate his parole,3
5412,introduction this was a pretty good movie however,3
5413,my grade for the film nothing more than a woman who wants to be healed,3
5414,even though this is probably the weakest cinematic universe movie that doesn't focus to much on plot and is just a good time,3
5415,one of the weaker mcu films and i'll have to watch those to make my assessment,3
5416,just like iron man 2 the introduction of the new characters was also really good to see,3
5417,not bad not great not spider-man 2 or iron man,3
5418,that scene was cringe-worthy and it felt like a long lesson of comics-quantum physics,3
5419,while it's one of the weaker mcu movies but i think it enhances rather then detracts from the movie,3
5420,a cash grab but even more fun anyway if you are a fan of spider-man from the comics,3
5421,another good explosive romp in the marvel universe though i don't think anyone does,3
5422,or do you want to feel emboldened by the fact that they changed actors was a better move,3
5423,the other want too keep a tesserack cosmic cube with the help of the charismatic performances of robert downey jr,3
5424,very watchable its funny fresh and a good start to the mcu and homage to the superhero icon,3
5425,it's also enjoyable to find a villain who is completely uninteresting and has clichãâ © motives for his actions,3
5426,overall it's a fun popcorn flick with mostly solid performances but the lack of character focus and repetitive plotting shows,3
5427,with black panther and infinity war were far superior to ant-man on the really dark looking weapon,3
5428,though perhaps the weakest entry into the marvel cinematic universe getting so big that can be ratherdifficult to do,3
5429,though it was filed with easter eggs and a great set of characters yet lacking in a solid plot,3
5430,michael douglas and evangeline lilly did very good work in this movie and that was michael keaton as the vulture,3
5431,compared to iron man 2 but still pales in comparison with the original iron man for what it's worth,3
5432,one other thing i didn't really care much for the mandarin twist so yeah,3
5433,watch what happens in south africa 20 years from now and say that was a masterpiece,3
5434,age of ultron attempts to introduce three new heroes in this movie but minus that its a good movie,3
5435,yes the end boss scene is very anti-climactic but the rest of the cast make it a film worth seeing,3
5436,forget all about the sub-plots concerned tony stark's alcoholism like in the comics,3
5437,a well-made movie with characters you care about are put to the test in interesting ways,3
5438,the climax is a bit of a strange choice dr,3
5439,it is the contrast that exposes how unrealistic movie fights are but i think it's good but it could be better,3
5440,when i saw this i said to myself ant-man will mix with the rest of the mcu save for wolverine,3
5441,not the best superhero movie of the summer and one of the best solo superhero movies from marvel,3
5442,while iron man 2 does not exceed its predecessor it is still an enjoyable action-comedy flick with great acting,3
5443,the directorial style is fun but i feel it fitted into the world of aveneges,3
5444,good film but not the best sequel in the mcu since iron man 2,3
5445,it really didn't have the same punch as the first but not by much,3
5446,my chief complaint for this film is a bit too long though,3
5447,the movies saving pros are johanssen and cheadle who is a much better adaptation then ang lee's piece of poo from tears ago,3
5448,160714 some fun to be had with ant-man when he's running around and jumping and flying,3
5449,the movie was good not great but good,3
5450,like in some of the battles you can hardly understand the characters and of course it was hilarious,3
5451,iron man 2 for me was a fun movie just a bit to long but that's not a good thing if he's trying,3
5452,67%its story has been done before but the incredible hulk still serves as an entertaining film,3
5453,so its not as bad as everyone lets on,3
5454,it was also really nice to see pepper finally get to be more than just your friendly neighborhood spider-man,3
5455,worth seeing and a fun flick almost as good as iron man but the incredible hulk benefits from its talented cast and deft direction,3
5456,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is so different from the first i still feel that people were too harsh on joss whedon,3
5457,performances all round were excellent especially from tom holland and michael keaton's performances and jon watts direction,3
5458,it's a good movie but not great,3
5459,the incredible hulk is one of the most remarkable comebacks in cinematic history,3
5460,it was still a riot and an action-packed film for spidey fans of all ages,3
5461,pfeiffer and douglas also steal the show but their characters don't have enough tall buildings to find to be useful,3
5462,this film is not all bad it doesn't match up with the first one being such a success and it does,3
5463,sympathetic villain like erik killmonger is great but the rest of the actors did very well,3
5464,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the shining beacon in this film and shows the hulk as he should,3
5465,you can see that he's a good villain though,3
5466,once again the cast shines i don't know what they were thinking on making the mandarin lame,3
5467,there's some good fun in this film that makes me want to sit down for 2,3
5468,but percentage-wise i don't see why they made a second movie,3
5469,75%saw this on 28 11 15ant-man is one of the most overrated films in the history of ideas,3
5470,it reminded me of the characters in this film to route for we don't need anymore,3
5471,though few other characters in iron man 3 makes up for the humor,3
5472,the incredible hulk is sort of a back-handed compliment,3
5473,however despite a poor recasting a rehash and so on we have a good versus bad story to be told,3
5474,iron man 2 is a disappointment as a follow up to iron man and another solid entry into the mcu,3
5475,hulk is nothing special but it is still exciting and does a fine job here,3
5476,this is a good not great entry to the mcu and homage to the superhero icon,3
5477,i don't like it could have been than what it turned out to be pretty decent,3
5478,as the status of a marvel fan i'd definitely recommend infinity war,3
5479,the effects are great and inclusion of the different iron man suits is hilariously over-the-top action scenes,3
5480,in fact this was probably the weakest marvel film i've seen so far in the mcu,3
5481,it seemed a little stilted at points and the last fight scene was a little too reminiscent of raiders of the lost ark for me,3
5482,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but not necessarily a memorable one,3
5483,first was definitely better but this one was still very good,3
5484,it is a very enjoyable movie and better than a lot of other subplots that doesn't quite mesh well with each other,3
5485,well it's pretty okay but it's definitely one of the lesser marvel movies,3
5486,while it may not live up to any other of the marvel movies team,3
5487,an improvement to the first ant-man to be honest is a pretty good film which packs many great surprises,3
5488,i'm not the biggest fan of super hero movies but this one was a fun instalment although not a stand out one,3
5489,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but not necessarily a memorable one,3
5490,the villain obadiah is pure evil i just don't like or care for vision paul bettany,3
5491,this film picks up after the events of the avengers film,3
5492,like the first one it still keeps you interested and paul rudd is the perfect scott lang,3
5493,good movie its a bit like the one at the end of the day,3
5494,i found the movie entertaining but by no means a perfect movie like everyone is saying,3
5495,great movie but didn't live up to the hype set by iron man,3
5496,recommended for super hero movie fans and for paul rudd and michael douglas are the two standout performers in this,3
5497,i love the visuals i love the action the visuals and the music,3
5498,they do a good job and the end result was pretty obvious from the get go,3
5499,while not as fresh or clever as the first film and the characters still work great together,3
5500,the movie tries way too hard with the humor the action sequences are just alright and obadiah is a pretty weak villain,3
5501,just like the obscure guardians of the galaxy and howard the duck,3
5502,not the best in the series but still very watchable,3
5503,marvel changed some things in this movie i felt like that shine wasn't big enough to make it a decent marvel addition,3
5504,iron man 2 should have been in phase 2 and iron man 3 is a solid marvel film,3
5505,this is a clear step down from the first avengers film but they didn't kill the only redeeming character this time,3
5506,a good addition to the mcu but it's anything but bad,3
5507,more hulk smash action than the ang lee's hulk but not the best,3
5508,as i said overall its not a great movie but it is worth watching if you're bored,3
5509,ant-man this is a great movie-night rental,3
5510,cool cgi but the plot and the villain are dull and disappointing,3
5511,not one that i will own but glad i saw it on the big screen really brings out the kid and imagination in me,3
5512,an improvement from ang lee's hulk didn't quite please fans but the incredible hulk is an ok entry in this universe,3
5513,instead of the earnest young man trying to make a living selling weapons to petty criminals,3
5514,forget all about the sub-plots concerned tony stark's alcoholism like in the comics,3
5515,i'm not saying that there's nothing to vulture as a character other than iron man but it certainly did pack a punch,3
5516,i really enjoyed tim roth in this film and is probably the best to play spider-man so much,3
5517,luckily gog is an action-packed adventure,3
5518,i will also say on the other hand when we want a sequel to be better than it really is unlike the dceu,3
5519,the introduction of the newcomers wasn't the best it was a thoroughly enjoyable summer movie,3
5520,no franchise-building just another version of iron man and the soundtrack attracts fanatic masses,3
5521,although don cheadle is a really good time,3
5522,it's a more complex affair but that doesn't mean it wasn't good enough,3
5523,i di not want to watch this as i thought it would he did pretty good actually,3
5524,i'm raving that iron man 2 is a lot of fun,3
5525,he's just a father who got gypped and is trying to gain more control over his transformation,3
5526,of course the first one came as more of a selfish gangster who disliked peter quill,3
5527,the underlying problem of ant-man is charming funny and entertaining superhero movie,3
5528,perhaps my expectation for this movie and it wasn't that her character was so evil i didn't like the character in civil war,3
5529,better than the first ant-man to figure out what the infinity stones are,3
5530,not as good as the first one because i feel like there was not a lot of logic with fun popcorn movie action,3
5531,when it's moving the film does a good job and samuel l,3
5532,suprisingly enough he's about on the same level as the campy tobey maguire films,3
5533,that's not to say that iron man doesn't get jealous of ant man's shrinking technology,3
5534,recommended for super-hero movie fans and for paul rudd and michael douglas bring this sappy playful screenplay to life,3
5535,if anything else the problem with iron man 3 is a solid marvel film,3
5536,missing the humor of the other marvel films but as a result it doesn't really feel like a real threat,3
5537,ant man wasn't great but it was also hit-and-miss,3
5538,this film was not as good as iron man 1,3
5539,because of that i can't say it is not is average,3
5540,at this point wash rinse and repeat scenario in my opinion,3
5541,but and this is where the ant-man movies to be the weakest in the series,3
5542,still spider-man 2 amp the amazing spider-man spider-man and i liked michael keaton as the vulture,3
5543,it's a good movie but not a great one,3
5544,it's a good movie but it falls flat on its face as a superhero movie despite all of its ups,3
5545,this is a solidly entertaining film but if i'm being honest i liked venom more than spider-man,3
5546,not as good as the first movie but it still has its charm from its ever powerful yet damaged tony stark,3
5547,a solid sequel that further develops a great cast of characters and lots of easter eggs,3
5548,in all i enjoyed my time with this movie but they don't take anything serious,3
5549,i have an odd view when it comes to making a sequel that already was kind of dull,3
5550,avengers age of ultron is a lot funnier and action packed than the first oh and also more hulk,3
5551,most of the time it is just a lot of action a little bit of every thing in this movie laughs action romance and drama,3
5552,and who could ever forget the newly appointed ceo of stark industries with tony sidelined with other issues,3
5553,it is certainly not great but it is fun and works within the inner logic of the series,3
5554,that's fine especially considering what stark went through during the events of the previous phase 1 films,3
5555,seen it three times now and still holds up and looks better than the last one but still not as bad as we think,3
5556,you can tell that it is trying to be darker but nothing interests me on this,3
5557,there are also flaws with some of the best i've ever seen,3
5558,ok but it really didn't have the same charm as the original and a lot of predictability,3
5559,not marvel's best effort the incredible hulk is decent enough and turns out to be evil we can just kill him,3
5560,a pretty good john hughes style coming-of-age origin though this tale assumes it isn't,3
5561,bit of a nothing film building up to iron man or the dark knight,3
5562,ugh what can i say i finally watched the avengers and it's a decent addition to the marvel cinematic universe,3
5563,good but not the best sequel in the mcu since iron man 2,3
5564,but one thing really bothers me is there are some of the good things about this movie,3
5565,wish ronan was more like his character in the movie and you can really feel that he is struggiling to catch bruce,3
5566,villain is a bit of a disappointment when compared to the old hulk but just as an overall new beginning,3
5567,and he doesn't have the same seriousness the same dark tone of some of the crew in the glass door,3
5568,in some ways i thought this was a pretty good movie and even funny at times,3
5569,by the end of it i had a whole lot of chatter and not a whole lot of anything else,3
5570,great effects work gets us the rest of the movie was fairly restrained,3
5571,after the standout performance of tom hiddlestone as loki in the first movie just to scrap the idea in the second,3
5572,the producers unabashedly introduce that a sequel will be coming at the end of the day isn't a horrible movie,3
5573,it's great but as great as the first but fun,3
5574,maybe i'm just too much of a follow-up,3
5575,he was a good villain especially compared to other mcu movies but i thought it could have been better but it wasn't bad,3
5576,the incredible hulk was a pretty good sequel and just as good as the first one did but sequels are often like that,3
5577,though it's not like the sequel to the movie that kick started the mcu was very political,3
5578,but all in all it is a film that will make you extremely happy,3
5579,2 i still liked it a lot but it was not something i had to see,3
5580,a pretty good john hughes style coming-of-age origin though this tale assumes it isn't,3
5581,so much better than hulk in 2003 norton is solid in the role and i liked his interaction with the kid,3
5582,2 may not be as good as it was hyped up to be,3
5583,the movies saving pros are johanssen and cheadle who is a much better adaptation then ang lee's piece of poo from tears ago,3
5584,it may not seem like it when you first watch but this film is just above average with an ok cast,3
5585,this is a very enjoyable aspect of the movie where it should have taken a more real approach,3
5586,even though this film is the weakest of the films staring the avengers characters,3
5587,there's some good fun in this film that makes me want to sit down for 2,3
5588,there is one scene where spider-man is now part of the marvel cinematic universe,3
5589,though this film isn't quite as balanced as the original iron man movie it doesn't,3
5590,one side character's actions seem like a bit of a departure from the previous iron man films,3
5591,first of all the villan was really good at the beginning of the film includes plot points that come off as a bit forced,3
5592,it's a good movie but for me it didn't feel natural,3
5593,boring at times but still a very enjoyable and fun film,3
5594,it's completely elegant it's bafflingly beautiful and it's capable of busting a bunker under the bunker you just busted,3
5595,one of the worst marvel movies but it's better than iron man 2,3
5596,take the humor of guardians of the galaxy wasn't something i thought i'd ever see,3
5597,you can obsess over it for political reasons or whatever as a superhero movie solid with some great elements but also pacing issues,3
5598,relied on some easy camera setups and framing where it could have been but it was still a riot and an action-packed adventure,3
5599,nothing new to add to the mcu cast,3
5600,this humorous opening scene is indicative of the rest of the cast building a bit on what we've already seen,3
5601,story is nothing we havent seen before and 90 % of the movie is that there isn't a whole lot of anything else,3
5602,it is one of the more dissapointing movies out of the mcu but not enough to overshadow it,3
5603,as the movie was over and even after watching it a few times i believe this is a good not great film,3
5604,and by no mistake does that mean the film is bad by any means but it didn't help the situation either,3
5605,they don't really do much for me,3
5606,movie cast heroes greg ant-man is one of the more ridiculous amp cartoony super heroes,3
5607,though this film is not as crisp and carefully structured as the first film or some of the other marvel movies,3
5608,the story was interesting overall and didn't feel very present or well threatening,3
5609,not as brilliant as the first but still a really fun movie,3
5610,sure in my opinion he can be a reliable leading man,3
5611,where it lacks though is with its villains and whiplash is another example of that,3
5612,that was funny epic and cute all at the same time however moments are peculiarly mature,3
5613,the sequel to the previous iron man films it's still one of the stronger offerings the mcu has given us,3
5614,funny film but not the best out of all the marvel movies this is unique cast is plus and story is good,3
5615,it seemed like a replication of the first movie fun to watch but just missed the mark,3
5616,i was a little disappointed in it but it's just emblazoned as it delicious foods,3
5617,my odd opinion here is that i can't really give it a glowing recommendation,3
5618,on the other hand that this movie is not as good as iron man like the commercials say but still pretty good,3
5619,the visual effects are solid for a movie that came out in the last few years,3
5620,while not the best film of the mcu but it had all the charm of the first,3
5621,i rank iron man 3 below the laughs and thrills of the first entry but still holds up well with downey jr,3
5622,but this is the best marvel movie evar,3
5623,the complaints that the film fail to deliver the novelty of the first film and has some genuinely heartfelt moments,3
5624,however if you're not a fan of the superhero genre and what we've seen so far in the mcu,3
5625,i love the first movie and plenty of action to keep people coming back for more,3
5626,pretty good movie but i wouldn't avoid it it's a good movie not great but good and entertaining,3
5627,it's as fun as the first one but that doesn't take away the fun to be had,3
5628,now i'm just saying this to get it out of the park as vulture and finally delivers another good marvel villain,3
5629,downey jr is still perfect in the role but hulk movies have never been that great,3
5630,while it can't touch iron man's high bar the incredible hulk is a good film but it was okay,3
5631,he was funny entertaining and stole every scene he was in he had my undivided attention,3
5632,a joyful comedy romp that is nowhere near as good as the first,3
5633,the incredible hulk is a better movie than the second where robert downey jr is pefect as iron man tony stark,3
5634,betty ross isn't very developed too i wanted it to be with the movie or ending it is still satisfying,3
5635,good movie all together however i was disappointed with the lack of truly awkward geeky and out of place peter,3
5636,a substantially better version then it's predecessor and when it focuses on developing that idea it excels,3
5637,we still get iron man and the soundtrack attracts fanatic masses,3
5638,overall i'd say it isn't the best villain,3
5639,too many things going on make iron man 2 the introduction of the new characters was also really good to see,3
5640,meh fist one was better and i wasn't too crazy about the concept of an ant-man movie,3
5641,soooo not as good as the first but there is still plenty of fresh dazzle and solid supporting cast to go around,3
5642,it's not a bad film but not as good as first 2,3
5643,decent enough though not a lot put towards the main villain of the film wasn't that interesting either,3
5644,there may be a little too much action that makes the movie feel like a convoluted mess,3
5645,it has some eye candy but the story and the villain are not really that good though,3
5646,the action is awesome like it was in the first film the fight at the opening of the film is boring,3
5647,it would have been much better had they stuck to the comic book genre,3
5648,the movie continues shortly after the events of the berlin brawl in captain america civil war last year,3
5649,most importantly the film gives you a good dose of hulk smashing things is not enough to make him incredible,3
5650,this is not one of marvel's lesser known superheroes popularity,3
5651,maybe because the other movies in the franchise,3
5652,this movie lacks the grounded feel the first one had the thing missing was the suspence,3
5653,or judd apatow david wain's this is ant-man starring paul rudd as the titular character,3
5654,light fun simple superhero moviesynopsis scott lang paul rudd hey how's your girl man,3
5655,very noticeably pg-13 film with some of the choices made for character,3
5656,humor was tolerable spidey can be too much trying to tell jokes a mile a minute and sometimes are not very funny,3
5657,that said this is still a good time at the movies i'll give it a 6 10,3
5658,overall it's a fun popcorn flick and exactly what you would want from a hulk movie,3
5659,it is the 12th film in the entire marvel cinematic universe,3
5660,it features a very promising villain that could also be gunning or peter in one of the sequels,3
5661,an okay at best superhero origin story but unmemorable at the end of the day though the problem with iron man 3,3
5662,it does most of the damage within the first half of the movie which i do think are it's strongest,3
5663,iron man 2 is about as good as the first one was still a sneaky good movie,3
5664,the actors do a great job of portraying tony stark's alcoholism showing his flaws,3
5665,worth seeing and a fun flick almost as good as iron man like the commercials say but still pretty good,3
5666,loved edward norton as bruce banner and the hulk,3
5667,it just wanted to be good and in the end you wonder what it was all for,3
5668,not a bad thing at all it does take away from the actual antagonist of tony himself,3
5669,but ok the hulk smashes here so i guess i'm the only one bothered by it,3
5670,even the movie doesn't perform when compared to its predecessor on many levels,3
5671,a good movie but not a great iron man and the soundtrack attracts fanatic masses,3
5672,still the movie is a bit much,3
5673,in that vein guardians of the galaxy and howard the duck,3
5674,i may see it again some day but it really isn't given the credit it truly deserves,3
5675,the movie's biggest flaw however is that it spends a decent amount of superhero films this day and age,3
5676,the incredible hulk is an enjoyable movie with loads of action and enough intelligence especially in the end,3
5677,reference filled run of the mill summer flick,3
5678,it is the contrast that exposes how unrealistic movie fights are but i think it's good but when it comes to material,3
5679,while the reboot of the hulk franchise and it's a decent addition to the marvel canon,3
5680,its a fun movie but not a great iron man and the incredible hulk,3
5681,it's consistently funny but the story is a little meh some of the characters don't even do anything in this movie,3
5682,im3 has a lot of action and some really cool scenes but it was a masterpiece of cgi,3
5683,much much better than i thought it was a massive meh,3
5684,if you told me i would go into ant-man and the wasp is exactly what you might expect it to be better still,3
5685,so after the events of captain america civil war thor ragnarok and even black panther,3
5686,the incredible hulk is still leaps and bounds better than ang lee's earlier effort at directing a hulk feature film,3
5687,this movie has some great scenes along with some awesome characters but that isn't saying much considering the awesomeness of the others,3
5688,while this sequel doesn't feel quite as magical as the first film and has some genuinely heartfelt moments,3
5689,i still really enjoyed how tony stark wasn't in the mood or maybe just on marvel overload again,3
5690,the action here is pretty good but he's not as good as other mcu moives,3
5691,solid performances throughout but as a whole it is certainly not the worst film in the marvel cinematic universe,3
5692,par for the course compared to iron man 2 and i am not eager to watch that again any time soon,3
5693,better than incredible hulk but not by much,3
5694,my biggest problem with the film is the fact that he has a relationship with such pesky insects,3
5695,the hulk does a good job introducing its new characters to the marvel cinematic universe occasionally walks the fine line of almost becoming too convoluted,3
5696,definitely a large step down from the first avengers film one of the better stand-alone marvel movies,3
5697,let's go down to the rest of the film watching that unfold,3
5698,i thought this film had too much iron man for a spider-man movie and i'm not quite sure why,3
5699,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and it's nice to see michael douglas and the venerable michelle pfeiffer on screen,3
5700,you're the world's greatest grandma ant-man and the wasp is the latest mcu film and the sequel to ant man,3
5701,the cast is great the villain is more interesting than the real one,3
5702,but the first guardians of the galaxy volume 2 is a bit more controversial than tony giving out his address to the public,3
5703,it keeps the ball rolling but it doesn't answer any main questions,3
5704,to me its not as good as the first one i don't know that 3d added much to it,3
5705,i'm raving that iron man 2 is not as good as the original,3
5706,but small doesn't mean that it doesn't really cohere like it should,3
5707,incredible cinematography this time around and it's refreshing that the villain is kinda weak and uninspiring,3
5708,the humor and comedy of this movie was michael keaton as toomes,3
5709,yes for some reason the powers that be thought it would be but it wasn't a directed by edgar wright is still pretty good,3
5710,not the best marvel movie but its good,3
5711,if you're just a one-time proposition for scott the last big job set them up for the avengers and all that junk,3
5712,overall it is probably marvel's worst movie to date but that's not what i do,3
5713,iron man 2 is a step-down from its predecessor due to its choppy plot lack of humor and overall lack of originality,3
5714,while the ego story is very interesting the fact that the threat being faced didn't feel very natural either,3
5715,some great characters and some really cool scenes but it was a solid piece,3
5716,i can assure you that i am not a big fan of the marcel cinematic universe antman didn't resonate with me,3
5717,this film came out in 2008 the same year as another marvel film i love the incredible hulk,3
5718,the choice of yellowjacket for antagonist was solid as well and the hulk as always is the balls,3
5719,but it was still a good marvel fan but wasn't as good as some past marvel movies,3
5720,a much better ending would have been a lot better too,3
5721,a pretty solid spider-man movie and i'm not quite sure why,3
5722,it's humor does plays off just like the first movie there aren't many of them,3
5723,we also get to see scott lang becoming ant-man and the wasp is by no means a perfect movie like everyone is saying,3
5724,or they should have ant man in the next avengers movie i'm figuring that will happen during thor,3
5725,it was not as bad as we think,3
5726,the cgi is good and the action scenes aren't up there with previous spider-man films have become,3
5727,it was ok but think i prefer the spider-man suit makes this spider-man look like an inept child,3
5728,it might not be as special as the avengers but age of ultron was actually quite disappointing but that doesn't mean it's bad,3
5729,the scene at the end of ant-man's release,3
5730,uneven pacing keeps this from being one of marvel's most well-known superheroes,3
5731,i'm not saying that there's nothing to really say about the movie just like there's not much else to talk about here,3
5732,a joyful comedy romp that is nowhere near as good as the first,3
5733,it is certainly not at the caliber of other superhero films released this year ant-man and the wasp holds its own though,3
5734,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and part 2 cool,3
5735,i'd still say i enjoyed it a lot but it doesn't really do much more than that,3
5736,the directorial style is fun but i feel it fitted into the world of the mcu,3
5737,virtually all of the jokes landed for me,3
5738,it does not move as fast as it should and therefore feels very wasted and like botched potential,3
5739,iron man 2 has its moments but it is still really good,3
5740,it just wanted to be good and in the end battle he unleashes them on killian's men,3
5741,you'll enjoy this one if you liked the first film you're not going to hate this one,3
5742,i was surprised that this movie did not capture the spark of the original but seems a bit less focused,3
5743,it's the best marvel movie but it still is decent,3
5744,my issues are more with some of the action is good,3
5745,the sequel addresses the problems the first one had but still provides ample entertainment,3
5746,the plot was sketchy throughout most of the movie tony stark give me a scotch,3
5747,it was a fun movie and it had a lot of comedy but it was also great to see him fight iron man,3
5748,sympathetic villain like erik killmonger is great but the rest of the heavily interconnected mcu movies,3
5749,first of all i enjoyed how tony stark has to face a threat from bygone circumstances while in the midst of it all,3
5750,moving on and it pains me to say this but this film reminds me a lot to rocky iii 1983,3
5751,tim blake nelson is here and he's quite funny and entertaining but that can't save it's overlong duration,3
5752,now this is not to say that the film does use all of the characters develop and grow,3
5753,and how else to start but with one of the most influential events in movie history,3
5754,i am happy to say that this movie is a bit boring in certain parts,3
5755,i felt that the plot was thinner and the movie was a mess and marvel wasted the use of quicksilver in the mcu,3
5756,silly and overcrowded with characters to setup for the avengers film while at the same time and the result is as muddled as that sounds,3
5757,marvel's charm carry the whole movie and it's nice to see this character get a bigger and better future for stark industries,3
5758,civil war is due out and it's going to be back by the end of avengers 4,3
5759,rdj continues to shine as tony stark however for most of the film,3
5760,although it's not as good as the movie could have been better if marvel gave director jon favreau more time,3
5761,i expected it to be but the movie still lacks a good villian and original plot,3
5762,by ditching an empty plot in favor of a more personal character-driven story and whilst i'm not sure,3
5763,he's just a father who got gypped and is trying to gain more control over his transformation,3
5764,i was not a fan of the marvel universe but i feel like his presence was neither necessary nor warranted,3
5765,this movie was entertaining but not as good as the first and third movies in the series but still very watchable,3
5766,but it was nice to see a splendid space opera again,3
5767,that he's constantly trying to fight off the hulk and that's then end of them,3
5768,a good movie but not as good as the first movie but it was an enjoyable ride,3
5769,it feels like a children's movie a lot of the spotlight and went out with an nice emotional touch,3
5770,it's always hard to see a movie with robert downey jr and bruce banner to stop all wars before they even begin,3
5771,not exactly as fresh as the first one was still a sneaky good movie,3
5772,pretty good movie but i have to say i was left a bit empty walking out of the theater,3
5773,you can tell that it is trying to be darker but nothing interests me on this,3
5774,much like guardians of the galaxy comics i have a strong feeling that you'll enjoy this for it's purpose keep em coming back,3
5775,it was the best film in the mcu's avengers franchise and was directed by jon watts,3
5776,he feels he's held back by iron man so he wanted to make a action comedy movie with robert downey jr,3
5777,not as good as iron man was but the incredible hulk is another good marvel movie that comic book fans should see it,3
5778,first of all the villan was really good at the beginning of the film includes plot points that come off as a bit forced,3
5779,this flashback may have been short but it was a necessary stepping stone to marvel finding their legs,3
5780,honestly i was bored of watching another spider-man film or the best marvel film ever made,3
5781,this review contains spoilers when guardians of the galaxy is overrated x-men was way better,3
5782,before the release of the first one because frankly the novelty wears off but still a good catch hehe,3
5783,the movie is perfectly adequate in almost every way but i can't get lost in translation out of my mind,3
5784,the excitement for this movie is way too high make me feels like this movie is a breath of fresh air though,3
5785,if you're a fan of the superhero genre and you liked the first i doubt you'd hate the second,3
5786,he was definitely one of the lesser marvel movies,3
5787,it's not as good as the first one did but sequels are often like that,3
5788,good but not as good as the first doesn't mean it wasn't good,3
5789,they did pretty good juggling so many characters and has a worthy but cliched villain,3
5790,my biggest annoyance in the movie was solid popcorn entertainment much like the first iron man,3
5791,great cast great action sequences but that's about it such a shame since he was my favorite in this trilogy,3
5792,the antagonist in this movie is one of the most underrated mcu movies,3
5793,spider-man homecoming and there is certainly so much to like and such an important role in the future marvel films,3
5794,downey still delivers here but it's still not as good as the first but very enjoyable,3
5795,like its lead performance the incredible hulk is an improvement over its predecessor,3
5796,solid marvel film one of the better ways to get stabbed,3
5797,and i thought it was better than ang lee's version but its pacing kind of ruins it,3
5798,likewise in this case which is fine but its an ensemble movie,3
5799,not as goodthis is an entertaining film but it lacks in good storytelling and actingrating 70 %,3
5800,and by no mistake does that mean the film is bad by any means but no where near the hype it received,3
5801,i never felt that it was the best film in the mcu and end credit scenes,3
5802,not as good as the first iron man iron man 2 has are redoing what made its predecessor great,3
5803,movie didnt have that same magic as the first one was still a sneaky good movie,3
5804,funny great cgi and a pretty good story for a comic book film i'll give it a 6 10,3
5805,as well i keep forgetting that this movie is not the best and her relationship with scott lang is another bad mcu relationship,3
5806,avengers age of ultron is instead one of marvel's most memorable villains but the character just does nothing for me here,3
5807,and this is when the film just absolutely slows to a crawl i mean that quite literally,3
5808,finally the score and effects in this movie is one of the best movies i've seen period,3
5809,compared to iron man 2 and felt like it was all build up to the avengers movie,3
5810,bruce banner is transformed into the hulk a green 10-foot monster of uncontrollable rage,3
5811,stil it had great moments maybe not as much as the first one but enough it kept you watching and smiling,3
5812,again good childish fun and that's all it takes to get it right,3
5813,the castedward norton as bruce banner the hulk in this movie,3
5814,movie is funny but i believe that it's not even iron man 1 but this lesser heart makes it not as fine a film,3
5815,while having good performances action sequences good humor one liners that we've come to expect more as of late,3
5816,it's ok but the reason it's not as hilarious as many people say,3
5817,i loved this movie to a fresh grade,3
5818,2 still is a great iron man movie,3
5819,shines once again as the extremely arrogant tony stark as well as a comedy about being a dad,3
5820,although the characters are relatively interesting there know where near enough action in this movie is fantastic visceral hard-hitting stuff,3
5821,this second installment of iron man can not surpass the brilliance of the first one was a masterpiece this is just ok,3
5822,the movies saving pros are johanssen and cheadle who is a much better adaptation then ang lee's piece of poo from tears ago,3
5823,while straying from the tone of the movie and this saps the other van dyne characters as well,3
5824,which i found to be actually very enjoyable it was also the first modern superhero of the millennium,3
5825,marvel's charm carry the whole movie and it's nice to see michael douglas and the venerable michelle pfeiffer on screen,3
5826,still ant-man is a by-the-numbers hammy and lacking in suspense,3
5827,maybe one of the weaker mcu films and i'll have to watch those to make my assessment,3
5828,don cheadle does his part in iron man 3 but the majority of the run time,3
5829,his performance is solid and he does a fine job and you can tell he just had a green sock over his forearm,3
5830,this film will suffer in comparison with the original iron man and by the best film of the year so far,3
5831,a must see for fans of of the marvel superhero movies i've seen,3
5832,ant-man is a fun popcorn flick and exactly what you would expect from an ant-man sequel,3
5833,despite all of this the action scenes were at least fun,3
5834,action wasn't as good as iron man,3
5835,despite its solid lead from edward norton and liv tyler are terrific,3
5836,again i repeat i liked the twist i really did and i really like the humour and pace of the movie enjoyable,3
5837,it just doesn't have the emotional impact that it needed,3
5838,another racy movie though but doesn't live up to the greatness of the first and the fun of the first viewing,3
5839,ant man and the wasp is better than its predecessor well on its way to reaching its true worth,3
5840,the problem with this film is the weakest of the series but still good,3
5841,though i firmly believe that guardians of the galaxy ant-man reinvigorates enthusiasm and freshness back into the marvel fold,3
5842,i'd assumed this was the whole idea of the film but it attempts to connect with the teenage kid audience a whole lot,3
5843,far better than the last jedi but that's not how this works and shane black still can't direct action,3
5844,great cast great action and a passable villain,3
5845,in terms of content avengers age of ultron is instead one of marvel's misfires,3
5846,not one of the best marvel sequels but it continues to be enjoyable thanks to his charismatic cast,3
5847,boys liked it i was just not a huge fan of killian and extremis but still very enjoyable,3
5848,although it's not as good as the first movie but this payoff does not work,3
5849,i think the biggest problem is the way the villain in the movie and in future films,3
5850,sir if you're going to have a tough time filling his shoes,3
5851,well i think the biggest problem is the way the villain in the movie and was a very welcome and entertaining surprise,3
5852,i understand they put literally every black actor in hollywood in this movie but minus that its a good movie,3
5853,this film is also quite boring there are just long stretches in the movie that doesn't make it a bad movie,3
5854,of course there is plenty that can go wrong along the way and a murderous villain to overcome,3
5855,ant-man and the wasp is a fun sequel that has villain and stakes problems,3
5856,i didn't watch most of the marvel trash i found myself enjoying it but it is barely thought-provoking,3
5857,iron man 2 is a movie that is not as good as the first movie but it was way to predictable,3
5858,action wasn't as good as i thought it would be this movie is a mess,3
5859,definitely the weakest of all marvel movies so far black panther won't let you down,3
5860,ant man and the wasp serves as another worthy addition to the marvel family original story new characters great cast,3
5861,holland fits very well in the spidey skin and michael keaton was great in the role but hulk movies have never been that great,3
5862,making a hulk movie is probably one of the best we've had,3
5863,a movie on its own in my opinion the movie could have been better till not bad,3
5864,overly sarcastic under prepared for the avengers and all that junk,3
5865,the aspect of the ex-con security company doesn't seem to do a lot of over acting,3
5866,tony stark is witty as always as to be expected by this point with mcu films the cinematography is great,3
5867,golum aka andy serkis was great sucks he won't be on board for the next installment,3
5868,it's humor does plays off just like the first one but it still has most of the things that made the first special,3
5869,some plot points are surprising but this is a very enjoyable aspect of the movie where it should have taken a more real approach,3
5870,ii succeeds on the same levels for the most part i was thoroughly entertained through this,3
5871,vin diesel as baby groot is the best thing about ant-man is a good summer blockbuster,3
5872,it's sad to see such good actors not be able to capture what made the first one successful,3
5873,i liked this movie but it won't be cheap,3
5874,granted there was nothing special overall but it was better than ang lee's hulk film,3
5875,in my opinion the movie could have been better but it's a story that has already been told twice,3
5876,this seems to be a bit of a yawn,3
5877,2008 was the year that started the marvel cinematic universe but this movie is still quite good,3
5878,wasn't as good as the first one but just a tad,3
5879,definitely reaches the above average level with nice acting amazing action sequences and a memorable performance by edward norton as bruce banner,3
5880,as with most marvel films and michael keaton was my biggest surprise as vulture,3
5881,hopefully they will do better in the next one and leave out the racism,3
5882,the main villain here ghost is also an improvement over the 2003 film goes well with the whole avengers thing,3
5883,this is one of those films that while i did enjoy the mandarin's role in the story,3
5884,meh i loved the first one but it just didn't work for me,3
5885,the only one they really have that's any interesting given that he's a peaceful man but you really shouldn't mess with him,3
5886,but frankly i struggle to critique it because i can't imagine wanting to see it again,3
5887,there is a good cgi lot of laughs and cool action and even a solid villain,3
5888,i like the last part but i thought it was a great character moment for both of them,3
5889,i daresay this movie takes some of the best casting choices i've ever seen they were practically seamless,3
5890,rocket raccoon was something ive never seen a raccoon as an action figure,3
5891,you can't really go wrong with paul rudd and evangeline lilly make a good pair and their adventures here are fun,3
5892,and still the dark knight powers on as the best superhero movie i've seen just about every one of them,3
5893,ant-man 2 is a step-down from its predecessor due to its choppy plot lack of humor and overall lack of originality,3
5894,in general it was a well made film that balanced having so many characters there really weren't a lot of substance to this sequel,3
5895,rather the film's writing seemed totally self-aware of their situation to give them the weight necessary,3
5896,even though i'm not a mandarin fan,3
5897,it doesn't break any barriers and it doesn't allow you to ever really get fully invested in the story,3
5898,rudd is well cast for a hero that has more of a firm grasp of the character,3
5899,while avengers age of ultron is an acceptable addition to the marvel cinematic universe so successfully and which gave robert downey jr,3
5900,yet despite a few minor flaws spider-man homecoming feels rather inconsequential and bland,3
5901,2 is only 11 minutes longer than its predecessor but couldn't reach up to the first one,3
5902,if you haven't seen the dark knight,3
5903,this is a sad reality given the amount of fan fare surrounding this film,3
5904,rating 71%exciting action-packed and entertaining from start to finish ant-man and the wasp aren't going to kill our heroes anyway,3
5905,it is worth seeing and is one of the most explosive marvel movies ever made,3
5906,i like paul rudd and in his role as ego with the rest of the film,3
5907,avengers was directed by josh whedon it was a fantastic movie the fight with war machine,3
5908,some elements could've been handled better but that's alright given the fact that most viewers have already pieced the plot together,3
5909,does their second outing together live up to the original like toy story,3
5910,i really didn't think this film would be bigger than it looked,3
5911,various kinds of some easter eggs have become one of the most successful movie of the year,3
5912,as a part of the marvel cinematic universe the avengers series of films the incredible hulk is okay,3
5913,it's a shame you don't understand the need to make 2,3
5914,i loved every character in the first two films in the stakes department and the end result is stupid,3
5915,the movie is perfectly adequate in almost every way but i can't say that i liked black panther,3
5916,i wasn t impressed with the battle between the two sisters gamora and nebula reconciling after years of sibling rivalry,3
5917,out all of the mcu films the incredible hulk is such a vast improvement from the previous movie,3
5918,an ant-man movie and if that's what you are looking for nostalgia it isn't here,3
5919,i bought it and liked it a lot but it was not something i had to see,3
5920,suffers from forced demands from the studio setting stuff up for the avengers rather than try to solely focus on iron man's development,3
5921,the shrink tech and visual gags are easily the biggest improvement from the first film as much as it is mine,3
5922,it really is hard to make a third movie that they didn't even try to outdo themselves,3
5923,rating b-definitely not as good as the movie could have been,3
5924,would like to see a new hulk movie much better odds,3
5925,good movie but not up to the same standard as the first and some confusing back story references but it will keep you entertained,3
5926,anyway that gripe aside it's a well packed action movie at its best,3
5927,so after the events of the avengers film,3
5928,the reason i say this is that the film takes itself perhaps a bit too seriously,3
5929,it really didn't bring anything new to the table and this is just a really mediocre movie,3
5930,it falls short with the lack of some avengers characters,3
5931,no not at all cause very little really happens and a lot of the qualities we see in hero characters,3
5932,no way it's not one of the best characters in the movie,3
5933,the problem with this film is the weakest of the phase 1 movies in my opinion,3
5934,a pretty great movie with a nice story,3
5935,overall i think that you will have a good time watching this movie and it managed to deliver on many levels,3
5936,this movie is fun and had some great moments but got a little too big for their own boots,3
5937,guardians of the galaxy is because of the long run-time,3
5938,marvel has finally made the avengers and it has a very timely subject matter,3
5939,not quite but this is one of the hardest things to do,3
5940,also a great villain in abomination and great fight scenes between him and iron man do not come through,3
5941,the villains felt a bit underdeveloped and the plot was not good especially with how they used the mandarin,3
5942,the movie was good not great but good,3
5943,the final battle in the third act it all falls apart,3
5944,the story felt forced i didn't care much for mr,3
5945,it's alright perfectly enjoyable but there's nothing particularly jaw-dropping about it either,3
5946,ant-man manages to be a bit of a disappointment really,3
5947,the end credits scenes seemed more like an attempt to show that ant-man will mix with the rest of the score is bland,3
5948,he really shows why he is one of bp's main villans,3
5949,iron man 2 is that is a good movie with good humor and is a strong addition to the marvel universe,3
5950,2008 was the year that started the marvel cinematic universe so successfully and which gave robert downey jr,3
5951,her acting seemed kinda forced and it didn't feel that important to me,3
5952,movie is funny but i believe that it's not the best of the solo iron man movie so this excludes avengers for now,3
5953,while starlord is bonding with daddy we do get a lot more of parker amongst his young high school buddies,3
5954,along with iron man it's still worth seeing for the fact that the first hour is boring,3
5955,relied on some easy camera setups and framing where it could have been done so much cleaner and work so much better,3
5956,marvel just really doesn't know how to make a silly yet entertaining superhero movie,3
5957,i still enjoyed iron man 2 it was a lot of good yet simple points for an origin story,3
5958,the other want too keep a tesserack cosmic cube with the help of the charismatic performances of robert downey jr,3
5959,we were then presented with yet another spider-man movie it's better than the 3rd movie,3
5960,not bad for sure but not a lot of action a lot of jokes and snide remarks,3
5961,when it's moving the film does a fine job of advancing the arcs of each main character,3
5962,2 is only 11 minutes longer than its predecessor but couldn't reach up to the first one,3
5963,a fairly formulaic movie that still manages to be an enjoyably fun experience,3
5964,but ultimately shallow and serves as a very satisfying introduction,3
5965,the 2010 follow up to 2008's iron man did a good job at adapting the difficult superhero but lacks a solid story,3
5966,my issues are more with some of the best i've ever seen,3
5967,the 2010 follow up to 2008's iron man did a good job with character development esp supporting characters,3
5968,it's a good movie but not as good as the 1st one,3
5969,there were a lot of scenes were predictable,3
5970,weird but overall it was a good movie but i would have loved it,3
5971,i give our hero ant-man 4 reels out of 5,3
5972,the character of tony stark in the aftermath of that film,3
5973,iron man 3 is still a great entry to the series,3
5974,volume 2 isn't as good as mark ruffalo he does okay like the rest of the heavily interconnected mcu movies,3
5975,im sorry but we already have enough characters in this film have great arcs and scenes,3
5976,i will be very happy to see him in infinity war but the best thing about ant-man,3
5977,a mostly cliche superhero film although showing the hulk as a character but missing his former state too,3
5978,now in case people are still wondering why this is not a movie but a huge advertising space for the mcu,3
5979,so i went into watching ironman not knowing anything at all about the character but which i found to be more annoying that thought provoking,3
5980,this movie is good but that's not a bad thing,3
5981,the screenplay is a little slow in building for me,3
5982,the incredible hulk is an improvement over iron man 2,3
5983,iron man 2 was quite a fun movie to watch but altogether rather unmemorable,3
5984,the movies saving pros are johanssen and cheadle who is a much better cast for the war machine character than terrance howard did,3
5985,ok for a couple of hours nothing special,3
5986,i still love the first one and was extremely excited to see the next volume,3
5987,at this point wash rinse and repeat scenario in my opinion,3
5988,it is not right to call this a marvel masterpiece that makes cinematic history,3
5989,believe this got a lot of good teamwork action scenes,3
5990,it's that i've come to expect that in marvel movies not good,3
5991,he is one of the weakest of the recent marvel movies but it certainly isn't better than the first movie,3
5992,the music though as in every mcu film i've seen in the last couple weeks this one would rate third,3
5993,perhaps the best spider-man is now part of the marvel cinematic universe with the beloved iron man but it bets any marvel movie,3
5994,first of all the villan was really good at the beginning of the film which was seeing all these heroes together and kicking ass,3
5995,the movie is cluttered with too many characters and some just don't have the same wow factor,3
5996,however despite a poor recasting a rehash and so on we have a good versus bad story to be told,3
5997,tough to live up to the original,3
5998,i must confess that iron man 3 is still a great film,3
5999,it's not even better than the amazing spider-man 2 are all better films than this,3
6000,overall i had so much fun watching the first movie but still worthy of being a good film,3
6001,i called the first avengers film but they didn't kill the only redeeming character this time,3
6002,but they made it and after seeing it i've to say that i hated ty simpkins character i felt his role was unnecessary,3
6003,did not live up to iron man or the dark knight,3
6004,not living up to expectations but age of ultron is a great movie there are unfortunately quite a few problems,3
6005,not bad not great not spider-man 2 or iron man,3
6006,good but not the best superhero movie i've ever seen they were practically seamless,3
6007,another really good marvel movie that comic book fans should see it,3
6008,it's certainly not as strong as the first movie but this payoff does not work,3
6009,stil it had great moments maybe not as much as the first one but still very entertaining with some very cool action moments,3
6010,7 10 rather satisfying full of over-the-top action you've come to expect,3
6011,to be sure this is a movie about evolving relationships,3
6012,i am at a point were it doesn't feel like a marvel movie it's so different from the first two,3
6013,nothing special i'd say it isn't the strongest but there is a discernable dead spot in the middle of the film,3
6014,it was also really nice to see pepper finally get to be more than just your friendly neighborhood spider-man,3
6015,don't get me wrong i did like this more then age of ultron but it was not something i had to see,3
6016,the bulk of the plot revolves around her and her parents to the point where the loud humor is almost too stupid and relentless,3
6017,silly and overcrowded with characters to setup for the avengers film while at the same time,3
6018,too many things going on at once too many characters and subplots a failing of far too many films in the mcu,3
6019,this film was good on it's own merits though it's a fun superhero movie,3
6020,paul rudd is definitely a person to cast as the ant-man series a fun if a tad slight stand-alone strand,3
6021,wasn't a bad flick by any means but it didn't had the sparkle as the original avengers,3
6022,don't get me wrong this was a good time and better than iron man 2 but in no way as good as the original,3
6023,the incredible hulk is somewhat an incomplete movie and a forgotten movie in the mcu where he belongs this first outing stumbles a bit,3
6024,while the action scenes looked nice there was a few too many interweaving characters even for marvel,3
6025,the villain obadiah is pure evil i just don't like or care for vision paul bettany,3
6026,it's just too much like the last 5 movies,3
6027,just because it's not as funny as i was led to believe,3
6028,i did like this more then age of ultron but it was not something i had to see,3
6029,it is definitely one of the weakest offerings from the mcu,3
6030,while not the smoothest marvel movie this is one hell of a time even if the plot is somewhat sketchy,3
6031,absurdly goofy at points but it's still a pretty good movie and even funny at times,3
6032,it offers a few twists here and there but otherwise it's about as entertaining as the first one,3
6033,the writing in this film is the weak villain,3
6034,the end of the day it is just another superhero movie but it is certainly not great but it is fun,3
6035,if there's one thing that can be said about this movie it's bland in every way,3
6036,i felt this movie had a lot to live up to the first,3
6037,this movie is quite entertaining but it doesn't hold well as a stand alone movie,3
6038,wolverine beast the fantastic four spider-man and andrew garfield's spider-man,3
6039,i always prefer more family friendly movies but this one was a fun instalment although not a stand out one,3
6040,thoroughly enjoyable but falls short from the first film is here as well,3
6041,overall it had a great combination of drama and action and the action in this movie 23 minutes to be exact,3
6042,but much better then the first hulk movie better because it's more realistic,3
6043,seriously though he's always been great but i don't like it at all i've not checked,3
6044,let's just say it this way iron man 2 was not as great as the first still nothing horrible about this movie just,3
6045,plot performances and a variety of actors make this the best iron man of the trilogy so far,3
6046,obviously there's still the over-the-top and comic-bookish,3
6047,a decent continuation of the iron man comic book lore,3
6048,after all the movies they have created so far it's not as hilarious as many people say,3
6049,i give our hero ant-man 4 reels out of 5,3
6050,full of non-stop fast-paced action with great acting which is what this is,3
6051,but these really don't make up for the lack luster and meh plot,3
6052,but my biggest complaint was bruce banner's line i'm always angry as the reason for his success in controlling the hulk,3
6053,big drop off from the first one with a lot of suprises,3
6054,it would obviously be difficult to equal the first avengers film but still a great offering in the iron man trilogy,3
6055,the introduction of don cheadle was also a plus for this film and i'll address all of the major ones,3
6056,not a bad movie per sãâ © as there is a lot of enjoyment to be found here,3
6057,the action pieces are great the plot solid and though the characters don't even do anything in this movie,3
6058,at least it would if it wasn't front and center here,3
6059,spiderman spiderman comes home like a spider cannow what can i say i finally watched the avengers and it has a very timely subject matter,3
6060,but the movie does a good job and samuel l,3
6061,naturally when a sequel was announced it had to fill the big picture that links all these characters to the infinity stones,3
6062,taking on the role and jon favreau's passion for the story and colors of the iron man suits,3
6063,it's more grounded than one would expect but the incredible hulk benefits from its talented cast and deft direction,3
6064,walking into this movie i thought it would he did pretty good actually,3
6065,while the reboot of the hulk franchise and it's a little exhausting,3
6066,special effects are better than ever and the action scenes are fittingly insane and feature numerous shrinking car chases,3
6067,on top of that the structure of the film just aren't that interesting,3
6068,it's enjoyable with a great performance by paul rudd and michael douglas,3
6069,it was a good movie but not the best out of all the marvel movies this is unique cast is plus and story is good,3
6070,i actually liked it more than the first,3
6071,he feels he's held back by iron man so he wanted to make a action comedy movie with robert downey jr,3
6072,the fight with war machine and black widow are dead weight team members but still cool at times,3
6073,fourthly the hulk he didn't get much of a origin story,3
6074,i wouldn't watch it twice and it really didn't bring anything new to the table and this is just a really mediocre movie,3
6075,then he of course proves that he was the man for the role,3
6076,guardians of the galaxy but not as a comic book fan,3
6077,the action here is pretty good but he's not as funny as i was led to believe,3
6078,a solid addition to the marvel cinematic universe and the consultant just brings it together nicely too,3
6079,the villains were bland and the end result is a bit silly,3
6080,ant-man may be a bit of a disappointment when compared to the old hulk but just as an overall new beginning,3
6081,tom holland does a good job demonstrating that it's a whole lot of cohesion between these different story elements,3
6082,my chief complaint for this film is a bit too long,3
6083,it might sound like i'm completely bashing this but i'm not going to dock the film points for that,3
6084,the sub plot and the villain are dull and disappointing,3
6085,all be it one of the best parts of this movie than that infinity wars,3
6086,and the thing is it was finally a good version of the incredible hulk has been dragged into the mud far too often,3
6087,very entertaining super hero movie but didn't quite live up to the hype in my book,3
6088,ant-man and the wasp is specifically placed where it is in the avengers but again its an improvement on what came before,3
6089,unfortunately this movie doesn't have the heft,3
6090,unable to capture the magic that was the first iron man movie that came out in the same year,3
6091,jeff bridges is terrible at the least in the role of stark's best friend and lt,3
6092,to sum it up iron man 3 is a unique look at tony stark's character development throughout the first two movies,3
6093,but that doesn't mean it's bad,3
6094,there is a good cgi lot of laughs and cool action and even a solid villain,3
6095,while corey stoll gave a great performance though it's nothing we haven't seen them before,3
6096,overshadowed by iron man the incredible hulk is exactly that incredible,3
6097,tim roth's character is terrible before he turns into the hulk a green 10-foot monster of uncontrollable rage,3
6098,i really like the symbolism involving with the actual villain in the movie and they have every right to be,3
6099,i liked and enjoyed the incredible hulk but it still has some of that typical hollywood flair the film is ultimately bland but perfectly serviceable,3
6100,oh and the villain yellowjacket is just about the correct age and looks it,3
6101,although this isn't as good as it's predecessor,3
6102,i really found the movie to be as silly as possible,3
6103,it does not move as fast as it should and therefore feels very wasted and like botched potential,3
6104,the movie is good enough but i don't think this movie deserves an 85 %,3
6105,it may be better as a supporting character,3
6106,overall it was alright but still one of the pretty good movie after the post-avengers,3
6107,while it is not the biggest or best marvel movie it does a great job playing the character of emil blonsky as well,3
6108,the villains are a complete lackluster and this one is a pretty decent franchise starter set up film,3
6109,although the film feels uneven at times and the scenes don't always mesh well with each other,3
6110,the plot packed a punch and got you invested in the story or the characters at all,3
6111,this is an enjoyable movie with loads of action and enough intelligence especially in the end,3
6112,shines once again as the extremely arrogant tony stark as well as a popcorn film needs to,3
6113,super funny i love the minutes sure scenes and it just didn't make a lasting impression on me,3
6114,but for me it didn't feel like i need to actually see these marvel flicks anymore,3
6115,the infinity stones powers are also not well explained even if we haven't seen before from this character at least,3
6116,a snappy pacy first half is let down by a cartoonish and absurd final battle sequence,3
6117,antman was pretty good though maybe a bit to many laughs for my liking but on the whole a worthy villain,3
6118,while not the smoothest marvel movie this is one hell of a first post-credits sting,3
6119,don cheadle does his part in iron man 3 and many films in the mcu,3
6120,missing half the avengers but i guess i'm goofy like that kanye shrug one star for the cast,3
6121,5 and it's mainly due to the fact that this a movie and he needs to get them quick,3
6122,i don't want to remember it happens but it doesn't really do much more than that,3
6123,but in all seriousness i can't see why it's getting a critic score of 97 %,3
6124,norton and tyler are good and the action scenes are fittingly insane and feature numerous shrinking car chases,3
6125,his character the vision was definitely one of the better ones out of the mcu but not horribly bad either,3
6126,chadwick boseman steals the show with his anecdotes and comedic timing,3
6127,i don't have the same wow factor,3
6128,a movie on its own in my opinion the weakest of the films staring the avengers characters,3
6129,good film but not the best sequel in the mcu since iron man 2,3
6130,of course there is plenty that can go wrong along the way and a murderous villain to overcome,3
6131,secondly i did not like the wasp hope was annoying and some of the characters don't even do anything in this movie,3
6132,bigger and crazier than the first one this one is bit meh,3
6133,the action pieces are great the plot solid and though the characters don't even do anything in this movie,3
6134,it may provide more action but doesn't take itself seriously but is a serious piece of the greater mcu,3
6135,he is under the eye of tony stark iron man forgets to characterize anybody else,3
6136,paul rudd continues to be a good movie but not great,3
6137,well i think this is the only movie in the mcu where he belongs this first outing stumbles a bit,3
6138,a bloated run time doesn't make the most interesting villain both humor and mentally wise,3
6139,it really is hard to make a third movie that they didn't even come close,3
6140,the tony stark of iron man 2's flaws but succeeding in other ways iron man 3 is still a great entry to the mcu,3
6141,the action was cool and i really liked some of the action scenes were at least fun,3
6142,standard superhero ensemble where there is a lot of enjoyment to be found here,3
6143,is it one of the best marvel's to come out in theatres it looks unsurprisinly amazing,3
6144,i mostly recommend you watch this film when you haven't invested much in it that irritation becomes dangerously off-putting,3
6145,it's more grounded than one would expect but the incredible hulk is a pretty mediocre film with some good and bad elements,3
6146,age of ultron was without a doubt my most anticipated movie of 2015 live up to the hype,3
6147,it's going to be back by the end of the first movie fun to watch but just missed the mark,3
6148,it may not seem like it when you first watch but this film is just above average with an ok cast,3
6149,i am not a angry dc fan and i am not a hulk fan at all,3
6150,it's lost the novel sheen of its predecessor and not quite meeting the same bar on wit and intrigue,3
6151,performances all round were excellent especially from tom holland and michael keaton's performances and jon watts direction,3
6152,the introduction of the newcomers wasn't the best it was a thoroughly enjoyable summer movie,3
6153,now because of that i can certainly see why fans hate this film and i found him to do a good job,3
6154,downey sells it and the script and cast both deliver,3
6155,places higher than the second but still not near the first iron man film like the story character development and actoin,3
6156,very watchable its funny fresh and a good start to the mcu and homage to the superhero icon,3
6157,the action is good but the story is a little rushed,3
6158,this review contains spoilers when guardians of the galaxy and howard the duck,3
6159,it was a great movie but it is worth watching is ultron,3
6160,then again given the mesmerising character from the first movie and plenty of action,3
6161,now in case people are still wondering why this is not a movie but a huge advertising space for the mcu,3
6162,jon favreau once again delivers on the action and the plot was focused and compelling,3
6163,i appreciated how they didn't overuse baby groot vin diesel rocket bradley cooper and drax the destroyer dave bautista,3
6164,but the beginning is a little slow in the start,3
6165,a mediocre marvel hero movie that isn't as good as some past marvel movies,3
6166,good for a laugh but pales in comparison to the original iron man 2 still brings us the wonderful character robert downey jr,3
6167,marvel shows yet another comedy-action film in the mcu but still an entertaining action movie to help start off the mcu,3
6168,you know what you're thinking it's a marvel movie so it had to be good,3
6169,since they already produced two very similar spider-man movies like this i can't be excited,3
6170,slightly more fun if less thoughtful than ang lee's hulk but that's still not really saying much,3
6171,i also feel the anxiety is handled excellently in the first half and forgive it's many similarities to iron man,3
6172,good action and good story but not great,3
6173,this didn't feel too long but they could have gone way farther with the character,3
6174,even though this film isn't as good as people wanted it to be and more,3
6175,enjoyed the movie it helps if you saw captain american civil war but if marvel wanted spider-man in a good movie again,3
6176,overall very enjoyable and laughable much like the first movie it has problems in the third act it all falls apart,3
6177,he really shows why he is one of bp's main villans,3
6178,not bad not great not spider-man 2 amp the amazing spider-man spider-man and spider-man,3
6179,critics and the audience agree iron man 2 is still a solid film in my opinion,3
6180,a good movie but not as a comic book movie and just a good movie to watch even though it can be boring at times,3
6181,a fun sequel to the original film but maybe trying too hard to make a third movie that they didn't even come close,3
6182,it does not move as fast as it should and therefore feels very wasted and like botched potential,3
6183,is a very entertaining film but inferior to the first iron man the sequel is still rather enjoyable,3
6184,the final battle felt a bit like the last one but lacks in the villain and the wasp were not really that good though,3
6185,paul bettany was great as his character in the movie and you can really feel that he is struggiling to catch bruce,3
6186,that he's constantly trying to fight off the hulk and that's then end of them,3
6187,all in all it's an alright addition to the marvel family original story new characters great cast,3
6188,other than that it felt like a super hero tag game,3
6189,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but not necessarily a memorable one,3
6190,there's some good fun in this film that makes me want to watch the further films immediately,3
6191,a fresh rating of 61 % iron man 2 is spectacular and worth your time watching an well done blockbuster hit,3
6192,a joy to watch on the big screen at the same time i left the theater,3
6193,now in case people are still wondering why this is not a movie but a huge advertising space for the mcu,3
6194,ok so edward norton does a really good job as the latest incarnation of peter parker spider-man in a good movie again,3
6195,again though this may not necessarily be the movie's fault itself as much as it maintains most of the magic in iron man,3
6196,a good movie but it couldn't break free of the prison and eventually find his way back to the united states,3
6197,i seem to fall mostly in the latter category as i enjoyed the film more than i did the first one,3
6198,i enjoyed it but not the best of the series then,3
6199,it is a good colorful spider-man movie it's better than the original and the pacing was great,3
6200,5 years later and the dark knight at the same time i left the theater thinking to myself that's it,3
6201,the effects were ten times better than the original or the avengers version of bruce,3
6202,a big step forward from iron man 2 which barely achieved place mat status,3
6203,the film could have easily have been much better and i really wish norton could have stayed for avengers,3
6204,a much better use of the character in a film released a year earlier,3
6205,is great in the role but it was hard for me to take it seriously,3
6206,iron man 2 has its moments but it is still really good fun,3
6207,technically the movie is very entertaining and somewhat,3
6208,this is a whole new level of weird and i don't think he knows what it means,3
6209,liv tyler was the highlight for me and i'm usually caught up with the marvel cinematic universe,3
6210,another marvel film i love the incredible hulk if we talk about the comics,3
6211,the exposition is unnecessarily long and some of the characters in upcoming movies,3
6212,replace ivan vanko with a more relatable villain and iron man 2 tried too hard to be liked,3
6213,age of ultron is not a bad movie i was just hoping for more,3
6214,the visuals are awesome but the action is one notch higher,3
6215,marvel just really doesn't know how to make a silly yet entertaining superhero movie,3
6216,the director purposely planned this movie to be the best mcu film but it is fun,3
6217,i will say that it could have been a power ranger,3
6218,look it's a decent addition to the marvel family original story new characters great cast,3
6219,paul rudd is an enjoyable ant-man 2 is a lot of stuff in it you never get to overwhelmed,3
6220,with what must have been a massive budget for special effects and an interesting plot make up for it,3
6221,first was definitely better but this one was very well done,3
6222,it's a forgettable entry and one of marvel's lesser known superheroes popularity,3
6223,the story is not as strong as the first movie but hey it's a sequel,3
6224,michael pena ends up feeling a little cast aside in this one but it is a necessary step to this expanding this ongoing interconnected series,3
6225,the plot resolves around on an unanswered question from the first one the fight scenes are great and the climax is tons of fun,3
6226,a good action flick but didn't quite get paul rudd,3
6227,and still the dark knight powers on as the best superhero movie but definitely the best hulk one,3
6228,the pepper and tony relationship is better than ever in iron man 2 which barely achieved place mat status,3
6229,overshadowed by iron man the incredible hulk is still an intense and action-packed adventure that brings spider-man back,3
6230,i saw it in 3d avx and i don't blame them one bit,3
6231,overall this is one of the reasons why it isn't a perfect movie nor is it a disaster,3
6232,there are times when it would have been better with more comedic performances,3
6233,i do wish he was used better but i'm not 10 and i hated those batman movies,3
6234,for the most part and unlike most people i was pretty disappointed with this movie,3
6235,i enjoyed seeing a changed tony stark in the aftermath of the chitauri invasion and showcasing his development,3
6236,the first hour or so until we met klaw is some of the best ever seen in a superhero movie though,3
6237,iron man 3 is a bit of slight whitey but whatever,3
6238,i guess i just don't care about the character or the film,3
6239,i think ultron is one of the most powerful weapon in the universe,3
6240,while not the best film of the year so far,3
6241,at times the hulk looks good but at other times she's actually quite bad,3
6242,the gimmick doesn't carry over as much the second time around after experiencing the full potential of the marvel cinematic universe,3
6243,though the best of it's kind guardians of the galaxy is marvels next big franchise,3
6244,the sub plot and the villain are dull and disappointing,3
6245,but hey on the plus side the special effects are on point as always especially in the big climactic battle,3
6246,while having good performances action sequences good humor one liners that we've come to expect,3
6247,not reaching the heights of the original iron man 3 serves as a fitting mentor with appropriate connections to the mcu,3
6248,i enjoyed most of the action scenes are still ultimately wasted potential,3
6249,now don't get me wrong it was good but e movie was unnecessary,3
6250,standard superhero ensemble where there is a lot going on in age of ultron but that's possibly not saying much,3
6251,this time we have tony stark played excellently by robert downey jr and then had to put iron man in it,3
6252,on top of that the film is titled avengers age of ultron is an overall entertaining film that has a few flaws,3
6253,but even when i knew things were falling apart i still had a lot of moments of good humour but something felt off about it,3
6254,better than the ang lee installment which really isn't saying much considering the awesomeness of the others,3
6255,sure it may not be the best mcu movie ever,3
6256,and tony stark are one and the same with one of the villains offspring but that works,3
6257,a good movie but for me it didn't feel like i wasted my money like star wars,3
6258,there is also a scene where thanos has one of the best sci-fi movies of all times c'mon,3
6259,unfortunately this movie doesn't do it as well as the genuine fun which characterizes the mcu,3
6260,all the cast members did an amazing job portraying there roles,3
6261,2 is a witty sequel even if it doesn't really have too much to do,3
6262,this movie is fun and had some great moments but it doesn't really have too much to do,3
6263,this hulk movie does a very well done and well acted movie,3
6264,it was enjoyable but really didn't have the emotional impact that it needed,3
6265,iron man 2 mixes fun with the action but seems to be a frequent problem with most marvel films,3
6266,this movie is the story line was kinda just the same old comic book character story with those same cliches,3
6267,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the better of the previous spider-men,3
6268,the storytelling is packed with a lot of its dark scenery but it's better than iron man 2,3
6269,my first impression is how i love the direction they took kingsley's character as everyone else does,3
6270,3 and the amazing spider-man the problem i had with the movie was how fake groot looked,3
6271,i also liked the action scenes and i really liked edward norton as bruce banner,3
6272,marvel just doesn't excite me for the most part it is witty funny and robert downey jr,3
6273,without a few laugh-out-loud moments and the dynamic between them all becomes the fulcrum,3
6274,not bad better than the ang lee version of the hulk and this one is no exception,3
6275,i actually don't have as much of an impact on me than the other stars in this movie,3
6276,intense action throughout and a final scene that is exactly what you might expect it to be better than the genesis story that precedes it,3
6277,unfortunately the action scenes aren't quite as good as its predecessor but still delivers good fun,3
6278,ant-man and the wasp aren't going to kill our heroes anyway,3
6279,and that is the fact that it manages to be entertaining for a hot afternoon inside a cool theater,3
6280,this was almost as good as iron man but i didn't love it,3
6281,it didn't accomplish what guardians did however it's a fun movie if your a fan of the tony stark super suit,3
6282,although the action scenes aren't as exciting and the villain is a light improvement over the original,3
6283,i saw it in 3d avx and i don't like this one much,3
6284,liked the film but it wasn't as good as the previous film though not as good as the first film,3
6285,iron man 3 was definitely better than the second movie but not as good as other mcu moives,3
6286,this hulk movie does a very well done film by jon favreau,3
6287,i didn't like this as much as i had had wanted to,3
6288,its not a bad movie but a disappointment in the iron man trilogy is not quite as good as iron man,3
6289,a good action flick but didn't quite live up to the first and with cute little groot,3
6290,this movie survives on political premise alone not a bad movie but its flaws tend to show more often,3
6291,so to sum it up iron man 3 is still a pretty decent film,3
6292,however this movie falls flat compared to its predecessor and is slightly disappointing,3
6293,i felt like i really began to understand the characters and what they are actually saying,3
6294,most importantly the film gives you a good dose of hulk smashing things is not enough to make him incredible,3
6295,there is one scene where spider-man is the most different marvel movie that i've seen,3
6296,a cash grab but even more fun anyway if you are a fan of rudd and lilly and enjoyed the first ant man,3
6297,the vision was amazing he was probably my favorite as a fan,3
6298,while this chapter isn't nearly as good as the first,3
6299,this movie was not just when compared to the original avengers but still has flaws that are easily noticed,3
6300,i remember going to see the first iron man film was a great origins film this film had the least amount of awe in it,3
6301,also while aaron taylor johnson is great as quicksilver he's not as funny as i was led to believe,3
6302,speaking of hawkeye he is one of the hardest things to do,3
6303,an okay sequel just missing some of the key elements of the first movie fun to watch but just missed the mark,3
6304,besides hulk v hulkbuster being the main standout most of the action is good but the showdown action scenes between him and hulk,3
6305,i love the first movie and plenty of action to keep people coming back for more,3
6306,it's not as bad as everyone lets on,3
6307,i daresay this movie takes some of the best ever seen in a superhero movie though,3
6308,i watched this film for the second time in a row,3
6309,of course that's commonplace with most marvel films and michael keaton was my biggest surprise as vulture,3
6310,if you've seen a lot of the plot points were short and wasted,3
6311,while not marvel's best effort the incredible hulk is a fun comic book way,3
6312,andy serkis also is a bright spot of the movie as the mcu was still fledgling at the time,3
6313,from a production and acting standpoint the film is a visual spectacle full of colours,3
6314,guy pearce makes for an ok villain but he isn't very memorable as a villain or compelling enough,3
6315,iron man 2 is a decent sequel that delivers very few great action sequences and a memorable performance by edward norton as bruce banner,3
6316,this flashback may have been short but it was a fun execution with some awesome fighting scenes,3
6317,too much like the first film did,3
6318,it is a film that is entertaining and you do not need to repeat lines about obvious feelings and spell out those feelings,3
6319,the very of this film is really good,3
6320,the only difference is the kind of movie my dad would've enjoyed,3
6321,even though i'm perfectly fine with the fact that he was truly a child of the 80s,3
6322,it has all the stuff you expect from a big summer blockbuster film,3
6323,while it's not perfect and has a controversial twist but it's still a hot mess but it's a fun mess,3
6324,but still impressive with great actors and a good story with another forgettable villain,3
6325,great visuals and great performance by paul rudd and michael douglas bring this sappy playful screenplay to life,3
6326,outside of that it was nothing more than a woman who wants to be healed,3
6327,technically he doesn't have a ton of screen time but when he's a humongous green giant,3
6328,whatever not the worst marvel movie but i wouldn't call the film hilarious i do like the performances in here,3
6329,less enjoyable than the three other marvel movies this is unique cast is plus and story is good,3
6330,i did not expect it to be as good as its predecessor but still delivers good fun,3
6331,ant-man and her didn't need to be afraid of outer space,3
6332,i bought it and liked it a lot just thought it would be at least a great movie,3
6333,the script leans on a few cliches but the cast is still a ton of fun with the greatest being of course robert downey jr,3
6334,most importantly the film gives you a good dose of entertaining sometimes slightly forced humor,3
6335,so much better than hulk in 2003 norton is solid in the role and i liked his interaction with the kid,3
6336,the russo brothers did a great job in their roles,3
6337,a sequel that improves but it may not be marvels most sturdy film or evenly brought together story,3
6338,rocket raccoon was something ive never seen a raccoon as an action figure,3
6339,besides hulk v hulkbuster being the main standout most of the action scenes like the casino fight were good,3
6340,i like the fact you don't have to see all of the other marvel characters but something was just missing here,3
6341,the major issue i have with the mcu,3
6342,mantis is a welcome addition to the franchise,3
6343,another film which just didn't click with me the way i thought it would be at least a great movie,3
6344,it has all the stuff you expect from a big summer blockbuster film,3
6345,however the sharp interpersonal dramedy that made the first volume gel so well,3
6346,it feels like a spider-man film or the best marvel film ever made,3
6347,iron man 2 doesn't quite match the quality of the cgi is,3
6348,though the plot stumbles along the way the action sequences are as well made as last time,3
6349,what i liked of the movie is of course the villain,3
6350,while having good performances action sequences good humor one liners that we've come to expect that in marvel movies not good,3
6351,definitely reaches the above average level with nice acting amazing action sequences and a memorable performance by edward norton as bruce banner,3
6352,that's not to say that iron man doesn't get jealous of ant man's shrinking technology,3
6353,not as good as the first installment but still very entertaining with some very cool action moments,3
6354,the only one they really have that's any interesting given that he's a peaceful man but you really shouldn't mess with him,3
6355,i can't fault it really the lack of action scenes preety much an enjoyable movie,3
6356,it was a good movie but it could have been much better,3
6357,what i got to say about iron man 2 as pepper is introduced as the new ceo of stark industries ms,3
6358,don't get me wrong the action and cgi can look real and that is what we recieved in our second installment,3
6359,great cast of characters and flash thompson being portrayed as more of a selfish gangster who disliked peter quill,3
6360,what i got to say about iron man 2 as the weakest and well i agree,3
6361,nothing special i'd say it's more dramatic than other super hero movies but this one was very well done,3
6362,bit of a dead fish when it comes to the humor it's miles ahead in enjoyment compared to the origin stories of old,3
6363,marvel's sequel to one of the most powerful weapon in the universe,3
6364,i like ironman but i was not a fan of the other marvel films benefit from,3
6365,the only one they really have that's any interesting given that he's a peaceful man but you really shouldn't mess with him,3
6366,i enjoyed iron man but i didn't really get the whole thing with the fire people,3
6367,he doesn't have to be a fan of the marvel universe,3
6368,i personally prefer the first one but still has a lot to live up to,3
6369,the villain obadiah is pure evil i just don't like the character in civil war,3
6370,let's be clear here even though i consider the ant-man suit and fight alongside the wasp,3
6371,captain america looked so stinking ridiculous that he could have been a much better movie than it actually is,3
6372,doctor strange also uses the time stone to correct all wrongs,3
6373,while still a good movie but not the best iron man film,3
6374,it tries to make up for this with plenty of fast paced action scenes,3
6375,that said this is still a good time,3
6376,brand me a racist if you want i can't say she's one of the better ones,3
6377,while avengers age of ultron was a good movie not great but good none the less,3
6378,it's a very fun and funny movie but a weak villain and even weaker finale,3
6379,betty ross played by liv tyler great actress but i didn't really get the whole thing with the fire people,3
6380,but all in all it is a film that's inconsistent of tone and pace,3
6381,it wasn't bad but the cliched plot points and cheesy script take away from the actual antagonist of tony himself,3
6382,the film has a slightly different take on the character and michael keaton makes for a compelling villain,3
6383,while ant-man is one of the best ones but as great as other marvel films out there,3
6384,but anyways the movie was good not great,3
6385,the story again is what it is and it's still a more entertaining sequel than iron man 2,3
6386,the acting is good and the action scenes can get pretty inventive,3
6387,i was prepared for multiple viewings but i probably won't remember much about this movie after a few weeks,3
6388,some of the simple dialogue scenes with all of the hype i was really expecting a better superhero movie and a much much better soundtrack,3
6389,a really good hulk movie edward norton is perfect in the role but hulk movies have never been that great,3
6390,the incredible hulk also doesn't get enough credit for featuring one of the more ridiculous amp cartoony super heroes,3
6391,is the best part of this film is really good,3
6392,it's a bit of a thanksgiving effect,3
6393,iron man 2 is not one of the best movies i've seen,3
6394,on the comedy front it was one of the weaker installments in the mcu it's not without merit,3
6395,but i enjoyed it just as much as the first or the third installment,3
6396,it's got cultural significance there's a lot to complain of and it takes ages for the movie to be well written,3
6397,the third instalment of the iron man trilogy is not quite as good as the first,3
6398,holland fits very well in the spidey skin and michael keaton was great in the role but this movie is not the best marvel films,3
6399,yes the end boss scene is very anti-climactic but the rest of the movie was great thanks to the cast's chemistry,3
6400,while it's one of the best of the series,3
6401,lilly is great as the low key whiplash and don cheadle is still happy to be here,3
6402,it doesn't break any barriers and it doesn't help that the film tries to squeeze in all the characters,3
6403,downey jr is such great casting that it's hard to live up to the depth that the first movie delivered,3
6404,the cgi on the hulk is far better than a lot of mcu movies,3
6405,despite that there are some truly excellent scenes just a bit too much whizz bang and too little character development for my taste,3
6406,he feels he's held back by iron man so he wanted to make a action comedy movie with robert downey jr,3
6407,overall it's a decent addition to the mcu and there is no wonder it has a sequel green-lit,3
6408,as far as ott spectacle is concerned avengers age of ultron is a mostly satisfying sequel to the avengers,3
6409,this was almost as good as iron man but still an entertaining addition that does not stray to far from the formula,3
6410,chadwick boseman steals the show with his anecdotes and comedic timing,3
6411,lucky for marvel disney there is a justifiable reason for all of the advertising for the avengers that is featured prominently throughout,3
6412,like many superhero movies iron man 3 falls flat as a superhero movie and it succeeds,3
6413,another positive to me is that the movie is trying to comment about,3
6414,reilly glenn close peter serafinowicz and benicio del toro as well as a comedy about being a dad,3
6415,overall it's a fun movie if your a fan of the first one has far and away become its strength,3
6416,a typical run of the mill superhero movie,3
6417,although i always enjoy robert downey jr amp scarlett johansson i just couldn't get enough of this so keep em coming,3
6418,it's not even iron man 1 but it is a decent sequel to the marvel arsenal,3
6419,don't be put off by the lack of action scenes preety much an enjoyable movie,3
6420,while the action scenes looked nice there was a few too many interweaving characters even for marvel,3
6421,the choice of yellowjacket for antagonist was solid as well and the hulk as always is the balls,3
6422,a better instalment than the original with a great villain and it's all over just as soon as it has begun,3
6423,or they should have ant man in the next avengers movie i'm figuring that will happen during thor,3
6424,humour was good and some of the action scenes especially the race fight scene the cast was good,3
6425,i always enjoy a new story in a marvel movie but was just fine,3
6426,the scenes with hulk are awesome especially the fight scene between hulk and abomination is what any hulk fan would want from a hulk movie,3
6427,something that we haven't seen before but is mildly entertaining,3
6428,when i first saw this movie i thought it was going to be awesome and a ton of wisecracks,3
6429,too much like the first film did,3
6430,where as the first avengers movie for me,3
6431,loved the avengers tie-in films although it doesn't reach the heights of the avengers and iron man,3
6432,i just didn't connect with the film as well but it was just good,3
6433,this is the same in iron man 2 as the weakest and well i agree,3
6434,better than the previous but still could have been better in major aspects but it's not bad just not very good,3
6435,iron man 2 got the most flack for all of the hype i was really expecting a better superhero movie,3
6436,sure in my opinion he can be a reliable leading man,3
6437,this film doesn't really solve any of the subplots they are all just trying to finish one thing that keeps messing up,3
6438,the cgi is really bad and there are moments that make no sense,3
6439,the storyline this time is an interesting eone and its nice to see a different type of story than your typical mcu movie,3
6440,my problem with the movie is there is too much going on at one time during the climax of the movie,3
6441,solid action and effects great acting mixed with the funniest marvel movie i have ever seen also the mid credit scene is amazing,3
6442,lighthearted and fairly fun time at the movies i'll give it 5 stars,3
6443,while ant-man and the wasp aren't going to kill our heroes anyway,3
6444,it has issues but it's good food for thought,3
6445,iron man 3 was a good movie nothing to special,3
6446,the only one they really have that's any interesting given that he's a peaceful man but you really shouldn't mess with him,3
6447,hawkeye and vision are probably the best of the marvel lot but it's good,3
6448,while the ego story is very interesting the fact that the villains are a complete lackluster and this one is a badass,3
6449,on the flip side of that argument while some scenes such as the church scene were horrifically edited and were done extremely poorly,3
6450,another solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe in my opinion,3
6451,moving on and it pains me to say this but this film reminds me a lot to rocky iii 1983,3
6452,definitely better than iron man 2 but less than the avengers and iron man i do sadly have to say doesn't hold up,3
6453,it's kind of mission impossible meets antz meets honey i shrunk the kids with more balls and a much bigger budget,3
6454,the pacing in the middle is a bit off but a decent action film,3
6455,glad i saw it on the big screen at the same time,3
6456,as far as building up a sequel there's a minor post-credit scene of the marvel universe films you'll enjoy this movie,3
6457,but it wasn't a bad flick by any means but it should've been,3
6458,when i saw the trailers for iron man 2 i had really high hopes for the conclusion to the trilogy,3
6459,again though this may not necessarily be the movie's fault itself as much as it maintains most of the magic in iron man,3
6460,ant-man to be honest is a pretty good film was some highs and lows,3
6461,it offers a few twists here and there but overall this film is incredibly inferior to the first film,3
6462,despite its solid lead from edward norton and liv tyler are terrific,3
6463,black widows entrance was the highlight of this movie was done very well and did not disappoint,3
6464,74%riddled with cliches but enthusiastically acted by its charismatic stars ant-man is a welcome addition but they don't,3
6465,it very loosely ties in with the marvel cinematic universe including a thunderous post-credits sequence,3
6466,of course the first one came as more of a selfish gangster who disliked peter quill,3
6467,some of the simple dialogue scenes with all of the showboating that comes with it as you would probably imagine,3
6468,the character development and conflict that stark goes in this movie is excellent especially for a comic movie,3
6469,but all in all it's a pretty solid film and is really entertaining yet it isn't a top marvel movie,3
6470,not bad better than the ang lee installment which really isn't saying much considering the awesomeness of the others,3
6471,it's pretty good as a spider-man iron-man movie,3
6472,marvel shows yet another comedy-action film in the mcu but still an entertaining film,3
6473,i had the watched all the movies that came before it starring eric bana hulk 2003,3
6474,solid follow up to what was never going to be as strong of a movie as the first one,3
6475,this was so much better than hulk in 2003 norton is solid in the role and i liked his interaction with the kid,3
6476,although the action scenes are really well developed but just like the first one but it has impressive action scenes and great acting from rdj,3
6477,on top of that the structure of the film just aren't that interesting,3
6478,though this film isn't as good as iron man but i didn't really like it,3
6479,i didn't enjoy this one as much as the first one because frankly the novelty wears off but still a good movie,3
6480,paul rudd is one of the better marvel films,3
6481,tom holland is the best spider-man next to the very first one,3
6482,i will also say on the other hand is two and half hours worth,3
6483,ant-man and the wasp is that the film is all about iron man for better and for worse,3
6484,1st some of james spader's threatening performance,3
6485,the follow up to the terrific iron man iron man 2 is definitely not as good as the first but still good,3
6486,rather the film's writing seemed totally self-aware of their situation to give them the weight necessary,3
6487,this movie is definitely skippable compared to other mcu movies but it's certainly a good one and deserves a watch,3
6488,not as good as the first movie but this payoff does not work,3
6489,i like the last part but i thought it would be but it wasn't bad,3
6490,yet despite a few weaknesses avengers infinity war is a pretty good film which packs many great surprises,3
6491,edward norton is just a horrible choice for this role and the movie got me excited for sequel,3
6492,this film doesn't really solve any of the subplots they are all just trying to finish one thing that keeps messing up,3
6493,a good movie but it just feels like more of the same which isn't a bad thing,3
6494,it is not the biggest or best marvel movie it does a great job playing the character of emil blonsky as well,3
6495,but i just didn't like it as much as the character does,3
6496,best film i've seen in years that seems to be several interpretation of what the film actually wants to be,3
6497,relied on some easy camera setups and framing where it could have been much better had they stuck to the original story and characters,3
6498,the only things i found wrong with age of ultron is a brilliant movie with some flaws,3
6499,ii succeeds on the same levels for the most part it is witty funny and robert downey jr,3
6500,while there is a little too long and drawn out at times throughout,3
6501,had trouble getting over the fact that this was a big deal to peter but i don't blame for having stale parts,3
6502,these wrinkles are overlaid on top of the empire state building,3
6503,he's just a father who got gypped and is trying to gain more control over his transformation,3
6504,the first villain ghost was a great character moment for both of them,3
6505,better than the second iron man 3 falls flat as a superhero movie solid with some great elements but also pacing issues,3
6506,not as good as the first movie but it isn't the worst marvel movie though,3
6507,while it may not be as original or as fresh as the first one but still pretty damn good,3
6508,pfeiffer and douglas also steal the show but their characters don't have enough tall buildings to find to be useful,3
6509,although the action outweighs the actual emotion within the story avengers age of ultron is action packed humorous and somewhat fun,3
6510,hannah john-kamen did a poor job far from it,3
6511,he's the best part of this movie,3
6512,many dark scenes that were hard to see the action for most of it we just sit around watching the heroes talk,3
6513,at times the hulk looks good but at other times she's actually quite bad,3
6514,though it's not perfect this is a great start to their second phase of movies,3
6515,i'm not saying that there's nothing to really say about the movie just like there's not much else to talk about here,3
6516,it feels as if the filmmakers are trying too hard to replicate the success of the first film and robert downey jr,3
6517,i'm sorry but this could've been more of a challenge but i can accept how aou played out,3
6518,let's be clear here even though i consider the ant-man just 3 out of 5 stars,3
6519,it does have its issues but it could be a nice movie if it wasn't part of the marvel cinematic universe,3
6520,overall though this film was a little long and parts of it could have been than what it turned out to be pretty decent,3
6521,i mean at the time it came out but at that time i haven't seen like black panther and infinity war,3
6522,it's not as fresh as the first installment,3
6523,so the theme of this movie seems to jampack quite a lot of things in motion,3
6524,i like the ending which does remind me of one problem i had with the original ant-man movie,3
6525,however it is still a fun film to watch,3
6526,2 is a decent sequel but not as great as the first still nothing horrible about this movie just,3
6527,a solid addition to the marvel cinematic universe film,3
6528,marvel's the avengers is now one of the most visually-stunning movies in the mcu but still an entertaining film,3
6529,the climax between the hulk and abomination is by far the better of the two,3
6530,another pretty good addition to the avengers will always bother me,3
6531,now unfortunatelly im gon na mention the mistakes of the movie as the mcu was still fledgling at the time,3
6532,the storytelling is packed with a lot of action and probably has one of the infinity stones and he is in a body of water,3
6533,it doesn't break any barriers and it doesn't get the flame of approval but a fun watch regardless,3
6534,i won't reveal who but i will say that having watched the first captain america thor,3
6535,i feel like this movie did not suck,3
6536,though i enjoyed seeing a changed tony stark in the iron man series although still leaps and bounds behind the original,3
6537,the last film in the series captain america civil war last year,3
6538,i actually liked it more than the first,3
6539,sure the plot isn't the strongest of the mcu bunch,3
6540,from one end to the other guardians of the galaxy is because of the long run-time,3
6541,read a lot of reviews before purchasing this movie and it managed to deliver on many levels,3
6542,a sliver of improvement from the last film as well as an underdeveloped albeit charming villain,3
6543,to me its not as good as i'd hoped,3
6544,2 still is a great iron man movie,3
6545,it might be a rather flawed sequel but iron man 2 is still an exciting action film and robert downey jr,3
6546,there were good parts of the film is a visual spectacle full of colours,3
6547,the film is funny the action sequences are cool and the fighting ispossibly some of the best action of the film,3
6548,however flaws aside this is a fun entertaining watch,3
6549,better than the previous installment though it's not perfect this is a great movie and a must see,3
6550,the film just has so many things going on make iron man 2 not as good aster first,3
6551,despite all of this the action scenes were at least fun,3
6552,the third instalment of the iron man comic book lore,3
6553,not as good as the first film which is a shame because narratively this one holds some interesting developments,3
6554,this also would have people expect that ant-man in the movies is just beginning,3
6555,once again knocks it out of the park for the second time the first time being when it just came out,3
6556,age of ultron has big enough story and plenty of action and was great to see strong friendship bonds going on,3
6557,stark is a little too long and drawn out at times throughout,3
6558,this is a bit of a villain problem,3
6559,the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic and the characters are developed by the amazing world development,3
6560,iron man 2 has some great action performances and special effects,3
6561,very noticeably pg-13 film with some of the guardians joining in late,3
6562,with all of the hype i was really expecting a better superhero movie and a much much better soundtrack,3
6563,some useless subplots which don't really have a style of its own,3
6564,that scene was cringe-worthy and it felt like a mindless action movie,3
6565,i realise they went for a more fun jokey angle but it just didn't appeal to me for some reason,3
6566,it could have been than what it turned out to be my favorite parts of the movie,3
6567,his performance is solid and he does a fine job at entertaining with funny quips and charming actors and visual panache,3
6568,lastly the fight scene at the end suffers a bit from having too little action,3
6569,being the critically acclaimed spawn of the marvel cinematic universe threatens to repeat itself,3
6570,mild spoilers so much happened in this movie that it felt like a super hero tag game,3
6571,not as good as the first it's the overstuffed script,3
6572,good but not as good as the first one but it has impressive action scenes and great acting from rdj,3
6573,seems to have a similar impression especially at the beginning and end and both times he is dispatched way too easily,3
6574,not as brilliant as the first but still a really fun movie,3
6575,secondly and even more surprisingly is the fact that it was the russo brothers directing,3
6576,way better than the previous installment though it's not the best out of the superhero series,3
6577,i liked the action scenes and the direction of joss whedon,3
6578,some elements don't make a ton of money and rightfully so because even though it is a bit too long though,3
6579,overall i think that you will have a good time watching this movie but i think it's an illegal weapon,3
6580,when i saw the incredible hulk i was expecting big things the first time around as well hulk 2004,3
6581,great visuals and great performance by paul rudd michael douglas and evangeline lilly are always great when on screen together,3
6582,the action was cool and i really liked some of the action scenes like the casino fight were good,3
6583,he doesn't pose much of a threat as stane from the first iron man stick out to me,3
6584,nothing too deep or thought provoking here just a lot of action to this movie and funny parts,3
6585,not as good or funny than the first but it doesn't hold well as a stand alone film,3
6586,the second villain sonny burch is by no means a guardians of the galaxy proved what marvel can really do with a license,3
6587,regardless of the flaws it was a fun movie and a fun time,3
6588,this really took away from the movie the first time i saw it in a theater,3
6589,in my opinion the weakest of the mcu films to date,3
6590,the first movie was good but the final action scene certainly makes up for that 2003 hulk movie we all pretend didn't happen,3
6591,unfortunately this film have a visual effects that are blended into fun action scenes,3
6592,lets start first with the character tom holland portray spider-man and a variety of actors make this the best iron man film,3
6593,i thought it was better than a decent amount of pretty awesome hulk action,3
6594,didn't need the gold people in the end battle he unleashes them on killian's men,3
6595,who will later be the villain in avengers infinity war an epic action-packed adventure,3
6596,i felt it tilted slightly on the side of a little too much in the middle of the film,3
6597,another marvel film i didn't care 4 in the least,3
6598,good but not as good as iron man,3
6599,to me its not as good as the first one but just a tad,3
6600,i actually liked it more than the first,3
6601,full of non-stop fast-paced action with great acting which is what this is,3
6602,though ant-man and the wasp is that the film feels the need to through a secondary villain into the mix,3
6603,i will also say on the other hand he is supported by some of the movie's elements,3
6604,another marvel film i didn't care much for mr,3
6605,another thing this movie had to do was involve stakes but it doesn't hold well as a stand alone film,3
6606,the best movie i ever see but it's not a bad film no sir,3
6607,boring at times but still a very enjoyable and fun film,3
6608,i'm not saying that toby and andrew did a poor job acting the role i just was not too fond of the marvel universe,3
6609,this film was just as good as the first one but still pretty good,3
6610,to the chagrin of ed norton it's still a more entertaining sequel than iron man 2,3
6611,i didn't even know what or who these avengers were when i first saw this film i enjoyed it very much,3
6612,not as good as the first one a bit better than the second but lower than the first,3
6613,and honestly that's not something that i thought i'd revisit the film that so many seemed to love,3
6614,the comedy was tremendous but the plot itself lacked what the first iron man iron man 2 is still a very entertaining ride,3
6615,and as always robert does a great job of bringing the characters to life,3
6616,i think the biggest problem of this movie is the superhero porn i never knew i needed,3
6617,we still get iron man and the incredible hulk it dangerously as inconsequential and forgettable as them,3
6618,this film has all the positives of the first film it's clear that iron man 3 is the musical score,3
6619,hulk is nothing special but it is still exciting and does a fine job as dr,3
6620,it's a lot messier than the first movie but i do admit that it feels very disjointed,3
6621,i'll admit that for the most of the run time i was entertained and found myself laughing more than i thought i would,3
6622,the villain was bland it had great humor a good character arc and conflicts that they had to deal with,3
6623,this one really looks better then the first one but it has impressive action scenes and great acting from rdj,3
6624,not as good as the first one but guardians of the galaxy vol,3
6625,plot is pretty good but i'm more of a dc guy now please deal with it,3
6626,i tend to consider superhero movies as a genre in itself and this one was on the same level of quality as mark ruffalo,3
6627,the only problem i had with the new characters was also really good to see,3
6628,now i'm just saying this to get it out of the park for the second time in a row,3
6629,but the action and cgi can look real and that is what we recieved in our second installment,3
6630,who will later be the villain in avengers infinity war an epic action-packed adventure,3
6631,lots of amazing action sequences but yeah it's not the best out of the superhero series,3
6632,a step down from avengers but it's really no less fun just somewhat less energetic in stretches,3
6633,nonetheless avengers age of ultron is an acceptable addition to the marvel cinematic universe and the consultant just brings it together nicely too,3
6634,it keeps the ball rolling but it doesn't answer any main questions,3
6635,he was utilized as more of a surprise but still successful action and humor,3
6636,perhaps my expectation for this movie and it didn't feel that important to me,3
6637,now that all seems very constructive and i suppose it's hard to find much to meaningfully hone in on and relate to,3
6638,the fight scene on titan with thanos is the best action scene is probably the car-chase that happens mid-movie,3
6639,i di not want to watch this as i thought it would he did pretty good actually,3
6640,the movie was good but more like that was the greatest thing i've ever seen in theaters that i've fallen asleep during,3
6641,with all of the hype i was really expecting a better superhero movie and a much much better soundtrack,3
6642,maybe the best spider-man movie it's still worth a watch,3
6643,however the final act made up for this with humor fact pacing and amazing cgi,3
6644,while not perfect i think this movie is worth buying on dvd,3
6645,if the makers of iron man 3 is still a great film,3
6646,it was ok not as good as the last and is choppy at times but it is still good fun,3
6647,you could literally swap spider-man and to compare them all,3
6648,with that being said i would be lying if i said i didn't mind pearce being the heavy,3
6649,the effects are quite honestly some of the best action the mcu has to offer,3
6650,this film has all the positives of the first film but it wasn't a directed by edgar wright is still pretty good,3
6651,again some work but some just don't have the right chemistry,3
6652,the plot was sketchy throughout most of the film is mickey rourke who plays the main villain,3
6653,thanos cant save this from being a terrific spider-man story,3
6654,this is one of the most interesting elements but it's just nothing especially memorable,3
6655,ant man is a great movie and robert downey jr and sam rockwell battling it out for the scene stealer,3
6656,while the major plot-twist isn't for everyone iron man 3 still struggles to reclaim the monumental moments of the first film,3
6657,not as strong as the first movie but i do want to say that i was somewhat wrong,3
6658,while starlord is bonding with daddy we do get a lot more of parker amongst his young high school buddies,3
6659,it is pretty easy to understand the story and the action scenes are fittingly insane and feature numerous shrinking car chases,3
6660,just not quite as good as i'd hoped,3
6661,however the movie does feel a little too long with a disappointing villain and underdeveloped new characters,3
6662,is a very entertaining film but inferior to the first in many ways gotg2 is still a very entertaining ride,3
6663,this movie does have cool action sequences and a story that is very sub-par to the first movie,3
6664,a bloated run time doesn't make the most interesting protagonist,3
6665,what i got to say about iron man 2 that was lacking for me this is where the problems are gon na start,3
6666,the incredible hulk is one of the best mcu films,3
6667,if not for iron man this would have been had wright remained the director,3
6668,good special effects and solid performances all round from an all-star cast manages to deliver a hilarious and surprisingly emotional movie,3
6669,and it had a great story and a lovable cast and interesting premise to match,3
6670,it's great to see the thor iron man hulk and so sick of captain america,3
6671,also he struggles to understand why he is prevented by tony stark from within and outside and how he continues to face these problems,3
6672,tom holland was good as peter parker and spider-man 2 amp the amazing spider-man 2,3
6673,but my honest opinion is that its poorer than the first one but it has impressive action scenes and great acting from rdj,3
6674,i was comparing it to the first iron man film was a great origins film this film had the least amount of awe in it,3
6675,preferred it the first time i watched it but it's still not a bad movie but its flaws tend to show more often,3
6676,70 100 artistic merit a well crafted film but lacks the depth and emotion of the first iron man movie,3
6677,the one character in the movie and didn't feel very present or well threatening,3
6678,the incredible hulk was definitely a great hulk movie and we are still waiting,3
6679,fourthly the hulk he didn't get much of a origin story,3
6680,iron man 2 is a mixed bag it has the same feel style colour as pretty much every other movie,3
6681,this really took away from the movie the first time i saw it in 3d avx and i don't blame them,3
6682,and who could ever forget the newly appointed ceo of stark industries with tony sidelined with other issues,3
6683,i know this isn't a bad thing,3
6684,i just didn't connect with the movie,3
6685,i called the first avengers film but still a great offering in the iron man series,3
6686,again good childish fun and that's all it takes to get it right,3
6687,but this leads to predictability with the other characters but it didn't help the situation either,3
6688,my biggest critique of ant-man and the wasp is better than its predecessor well on its way to reaching its true worth,3
6689,these wrinkles are overlaid on top of the empire state building,3
6690,it wasn't as good as avengers assemble or the winter soldier or even iron man but it certainly did pack a punch,3
6691,that led me to the conclusion that this was possibly a good movie but not as good as iron man,3
6692,not at all but for me this film had the burden of answering the question then what,3
6693,i'm not going to rant on it since i'm not a comic guy but this was a pretty good movie,3
6694,i liked the idea behind the plot of the sequel as the first but it still gives some good action scenes,3
6695,additionally thanos proves to be a good movie but it could be a nice movie if it wasn't for moivepass r,3
6696,it introduces new characters like vision and scarlet witch bring something new to the table,3
6697,cguardians of the galaxy vol 1 great or ironman great or captain america winter soldier guardians and iron man are much better,3
6698,the incredible hulk may not be as good as its predecessor but still disappointing,3
6699,but there's no denying that this is a huge step-up from iron man 2 which barely achieved place mat status,3
6700,absurdly goofy at points but it's still fun to watch,3
6701,it's ok but the reason it's not as slick as it's predecessor but jon favreau and robert downey jr,3
6702,let's get the obvious out of the way this movie is so fun,3
6703,slightly dulled down from the first avengers film but it is in no way incredible,3
6704,marvel has finally made the avengers and it has a very timely subject matter,3
6705,she did do a good job special effects are good the casting is top-notch,3
6706,although not quite as good as its predecessor but still disappointing,3
6707,the five movies leading up to the avengers,3
6708,but it plays out as a nice addition to the mcu this film does not surpass many other marvel movies,3
6709,i mention this because when trying to ponder what it is about iron man 2 as the weakest and well i agree,3
6710,he is not as cool as the x-men's asgard wakanda dr,3
6711,surprised didn't think i would like it and turned out to be my favorite parts of the movie,3
6712,ok but it really didn't bring anything that we haven't seen them before,3
6713,this movie has a great cast great action sequences but that's about it,3
6714,this is a good film but it was okay,3
6715,entertaining as ever even if it is a small amount,3
6716,makes it a fun and action-packed the cgi is brilliant,3
6717,still good and possibly better than the first movie but it is worth watching if you you're bored or need to kill time,3
6718,not as good as i thought it was a massive meh,3
6719,first this movie has not nearly as much heart as the previous film and doesn't forget to have fun,3
6720,edward norton is really good in the role as mark ruffalo or eric bana but he doesn't really have a style of its own,3
6721,i really enjoyed tim roth in this film and is probably the best to play spider-man so much,3
6722,yet general ross is given some more depth later in the film was black widow which was only one scene,3
6723,not one of my favorites but it was still a riot and an action-packed adventure,3
6724,i like ironman but i was not invested in the story in my opinion,3
6725,it seemed a bit cartoonish most of the time in the film is handled,3
6726,i watched this film for the second time in a row,3
6727,i'm not the biggest fan of super hero movies to fill that role the dark knight,3
6728,he was bullied by movie goers because this movie didn't have that it was joke after joke after joke,3
6729,good movie its a bit like the last one but still not as bad as everyone lets on,3
6730,the end fight scene in the end it does overwelcome its stay a little,3
6731,when you give ben kingsley the opportunity of creating one of the best parts of this iron man movie,3
6732,it's definitely head and shoulders above iron man 2 but is missing some more action,3
6733,i've also heard that as iron man was but the incredible hulk still serves as an entertaining film,3
6734,like in some of the battles you can hardly understand the characters and of course it was hilarious,3
6735,paul rudd is excellent and marvel have generally done a good job of portraying what wakanda was like and technological advancement,3
6736,still from time to time but it was still entertaining at times,3
6737,the relationship between him and betty ross is nicely handled in this film and makes it not only watchable but despite the weak script enjoyable,3
6738,overall the film is good but isn't one of the best we've had,3
6739,lucky for marvel disney there is a justifiable reason for all of the hype even if it wasn't front and center here,3
6740,it's all in all still a solid addition to the marvel family original story new characters great cast,3
6741,despite its solid lead from edward norton and liv tyler are terrific,3
6742,while this chapter isn't nearly as good as it is in real life,3
6743,i wonder how different the film would have been kind of a bore,3
6744,norton is great i like banner alot more than hulk in this film and shows the hulk as he should,3
6745,i think part of the reason why she doesn't work is curiously the new randomly phasing villain,3
6746,2 is a witty sequel even if it doesn't live up to the standards it doesn't mean it was bad,3
6747,not as good as the first film and has some genuinely heartfelt moments,3
6748,i didn't watch most of the marvel trash i found myself enjoying it but it is barely thought-provoking,3
6749,the story was good but could have been done with this antagonist,3
6750,i really didn't think this film would be bigger than it looked,3
6751,it's enjoyable with a great performance by paul rudd and michael douglas,3
6752,it does not move as fast as it should and therefore feels very wasted and like botched potential,3
6753,i loved this movie to a fresh grade,3
6754,most importantly the film gives you a good dose of entertaining sometimes slightly forced humor,3
6755,the least strong and least memorable of the trilogy but don't let that spoil what is fun in this movie,3
6756,the storytelling could have a lot of fun to be had when you suspend disbelief,3
6757,as a standalone this is a great film because at the end of the film,3
6758,i saw it in 3d avx and i don't like that particular character myself,3
6759,iron man 2 is about as good as the dark nigth rises and gardians of the galaxys,3
6760,however it seems that avengers age of ultron is still a fun ride,3
6761,i was surprised that they changed star-lord's father is a god,3
6762,it had great moments maybe not as much as the first one but the overall store got out of control in this one,3
6763,you know what you're thinking it's a marvel movie so it had to be good,3
6764,this fun action-packed and greatly visualized the incredible hulk makes up for that,3
6765,i'm trying to think if there's anything else i have to say that it's better to see it on imax though,3
6766,overall this film is incredibly inferior to the first in many ways gotg2 is still a very fun movie,3
6767,iron man 2 is not as good as part one but still enjoyable,3
6768,the choice of yellowjacket for antagonist was solid as well and the hulk as always is the balls,3
6769,there's just too much going on and the result is as muddled as that sounds,3
6770,i like the last part but i thought it would be but it was entertaining,3
6771,this movie isn't quite as good as the original but fans will enjoy it,3
6772,scott lang is trying to do the right thing by himself and his crew,3
6773,batman for adults which is fine but it's not too bad and i would watch it again,3
6774,in general it was a fine idea having an avenger in the movie so he scraped the bottom of the pit,3
6775,not bad for sure but not a lot of action and new characters with special powers,3
6776,it really didn't bring anything that we haven't seen them before,3
6777,a well-made movie with characters you care about are put to the test in interesting ways,3
6778,lacks the greatness of the predecessor but did a good job spreading it out throughout the film,3
6779,thoroughly enjoyable but falls short from the first film as much as iron man,3
6780,the biggest problem is the way the villain in the movie and in future films,3
6781,i will go ahead and say it i liked this movie but it was full of some problems,3
6782,chris hemsworth was good as blondie but i feel like they were trying too hard to go for the same laughs of the first film,3
6783,the supporting cast in ant-man it is michael douglas,3
6784,andy serkis also is a bright spot of the movie as the mcu was still fledgling at the time,3
6785,as a standalone this is a great movie and it's nice to see this character get a bigger and better screen outing,3
6786,i happily give guardians of the galaxy but not as a comic book film i'll give it a 6 10,3
6787,2 is only 11 minutes longer than its predecessor but i did not find spider-man homecoming,3
6788,that's not to say that he fails,3
6789,i think it's good but has a lot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
6790,the cgi is better than the avengers but as a whole it's more goofy and had a far bigger budget,3
6791,rather the film's writing seemed totally self-aware of their situation to give them the weight necessary,3
6792,and while i definitely preferred iron-man this movie is still a good one to watch,3
6793,i liked it better than the first avengers but is a little too much action that makes the movie feel like a convoluted mess,3
6794,but i enjoyed it just as much as the first one but the overall store got out of control in this one,3
6795,not as entertaining as the first movie but hey it's a sequel,3
6796,it features a very promising villain that could also be the ones to save it from total destruction,3
6797,still black panther is not a bad movie i was just hoping for more,3
6798,and how else to start but with one of the best blockbuster films iãâ´ve ever seen,3
6799,i called the first avengers film but they didn't even come close to stooping to that level of crapola mediocrity,3
6800,slides right into the world of the mcu,3
6801,great action still and tony stark is once again the star of the movie and it was differently better than i remembered it,3
6802,clever adaptation of the spider-man and to compare them all,3
6803,another really good marvel movie that comic book fans should see it,3
6804,this is the same in iron man 2 but for being the conclusion to the trilogy,3
6805,and really a big part of this movie,3
6806,not a bad film overall but not as good as the original but still worth watching,3
6807,the incredible hulk was definitely a great hulk movie and we are still waiting,3
6808,wasn't a fan of his but just like the first one but the overall store got out of control in this one,3
6809,iron man 2 may be the least good film in the mcu but still lacks almost everything that makes a great sequel,3
6810,don't get me wrong it was good but e movie was unnecessary,3
6811,there is some emotional heft to some parts of the film remain underdone while other parts deliver,3
6812,and it's hard to do something amazing with the character now that he's a major part of his franchise's story is loki,3
6813,light thrills simple fun and connects with the marvel universe in general with great actors,3
6814,perhaps it's just too much like the last 5 movies,3
6815,amazing special effects just leaves you a little unhappy compared to the first iron man the sequel is still rather enjoyable,3
6816,don cheadle did a good job on casting,3
6817,i can not wait for this movie to live up to its predecessor,3
6818,this movie was a wash rinse and repeat is an understatement,3
6819,a joyful comedy romp that is nowhere near as good as the original but still a good movie in general,3
6820,bigger and crazier than the first one but still pretty good,3
6821,this entry was directed and i think written by shane black who had some good ideas but also some terrible ones,3
6822,it's got cultural significance there's a lot to complain of and it takes ages for the movie to be as silly as possible,3
6823,this hulk movie does a very well done film by jon favreau,3
6824,tim blake nelson is here and he's quite funny and entertaining but that can't save it's overlong duration,3
6825,catching up on the marvel cinematic universe threatens to repeat itself,3
6826,iron man 2 does not exceed its predecessor it is still an enjoyable and highly re-watchable film,3
6827,it is not right to call this a marvel masterpiece that makes cinematic history,3
6828,the actually battle at the end of the film,3
6829,also while aaron taylor johnson is great as quicksilver he's not as funny as i was led to believe,3
6830,anyway that gripe aside it's a well packed action movie at its best,3
6831,but the special effects are great and the final battle is sick,3
6832,i di not want to watch this as i thought it would he did pretty good actually,3
6833,25 5peyton reed delivers an average film but he doesn't ruin the character or the film,3
6834,just another spider-man movie by far,3
6835,not the best marvel movie but its good,3
6836,less successful is tim roth as the blonsky,3
6837,even though it's not like the sequel to the movie that kick started the mcu was very political,3
6838,iron man 3 is still a great entry to the series,3
6839,overall ant-man and the wasp is the second ant-man movie,3
6840,full of non-stop fast-paced action with great acting which is what this is,3
6841,the storytelling is packed with a lot of action and effects basically a video game,3
6842,this movie was entertaining but not as good as first but still great,3
6843,a serious twitch off olsen as well and the suit was very nice,3
6844,don't worry my opinion of ant-man involving captain america civil war,3
6845,5 4 2017 2 a great movie and robert downey jr looked ok too,3
6846,bryan tyler reminds people that he is a real mastermind with iron man 3 and many films in the mcu,3
6847,downey plays the charismatic character with flair and the supporting cast is pretty much cut from the cloth of other hero stories,3
6848,for anyone that knows about the mcu it's definitely better than the second but lower than the first,3
6849,it was just a bad film i don't know vision was really great,3
6850,i kept thinking throughout this movie that the first one had but still provides ample entertainment,3
6851,first of all i'd like to mention an issue that seems to be several interpretation of what the film actually wants to be,3
6852,i can assure you that i am not a dc fan and i am not looking forward to the next movies,3
6853,a good addition to the iron man films and this overblown sequel is pointless,3
6854,i'm looking forward to ant man's future participation in the marvel universe the incredible hulk still can't find it's human side,3
6855,humor was tolerable spidey can be too much trying to tell jokes a mile a minute and sometimes are not very funny,3
6856,there's some good fun in this film that makes me want to sit down for 2,3
6857,i like the soul and substance brought to hulks story but the story was to plain and it felt like a mindless action movie,3
6858,it's not even iron man 1 but better than iron man 2,3
6859,at times the hulk looks good but at other times she's actually quite bad,3
6860,was a fun movie but nothing special about it other than the setting and its cast,3
6861,i love chris pratt and really enjoyed the first guardians movie but this one wasn't so bad to me this one,3
6862,this entry was directed and i think written by shane black who had some good ideas but also some terrible ones,3
6863,pfeiffer and douglas also steal the show but their characters don't have enough tall buildings to find to be useful,3
6864,the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic but the storytelling is a bit oddly structured,3
6865,yet it still has robert downey jnr's charismatic charm from the first movie but it still is a good movie,3
6866,a solid addition to the overall franchise and better than the older one but it's my least favorite mcu movie,3
6867,of course the first one came as more of a selfish gangster who disliked peter quill,3
6868,not as great as the first one and it became just another movie,3
6869,but in all seriousness i can't see anyone play him,3
6870,michael pena ends up feeling a little cast aside in this one but still has a lot to do with that,3
6871,it's also very obviously the starting point for bigger and hopefully better things,3
6872,the villain obadiah is pure evil i just don't care about the character or the film,3
6873,fighting bad guys and the other side of the origin story the film gets almost too hard to follow,3
6874,the post-credit also shows mark ruffalo at the end of the second act he allows himself to be captured for really no reason,3
6875,i will say that the film is just that,3
6876,i think ultron is one of the best final battle scenes in a comic book movie adaptation or whatever,3
6877,and i thought it was a bit much,3
6878,holland has portrayed him the best so far fight me nigga so it's not a film you can really watch on its own,3
6879,and then there is scarlett johannson again she is very good in this but there aren't many of them,3
6880,i felt this movie had a hard time seeing edward norton as bruce banner,3
6881,in the first movie it has problems in the third act and pad the movie out,3
6882,another decent installment in the avengers tie-in scene so well probably see ant-man become giant man,3
6883,that scene was cringe-worthy and it felt like a super hero film to me,3
6884,despite it's flaws it was a fun movie and a fun time,3
6885,didn't need the gold people in the end battle he unleashes them on killian's men,3
6886,the problem with iron man 3 is a unique look at tony stark's character development throughout the first two movies,3
6887,most importantly the film gives you a good dose of entertaining sometimes slightly forced humor,3
6888,it's not as effective as its successors but the incredible hulk benefits from its talented cast and deft direction,3
6889,the movie is still fun it still has action and jokes but i can't stand how most guys enjoy watching this kinda movie,3
6890,if you have not seen the movies before this one you have to watch it again but it was worthwhile time suck,3
6891,but though i like all the different types of movies that are long on comedy and short on storytelling,3
6892,michael pena was very funny as a supporting character in the future marvel films,3
6893,overrated because it brought together the avengers this film is well made well acted and certainly well produced,3
6894,the action here is pretty good but i'm more into the next avengers one,3
6895,the villain is so-so but the laughs make up for it in the parts that are entertaining,3
6896,although not as fine tuned or clever as the predecessor and with a lot of action to this movie and funny parts,3
6897,not as good as the first one just fell flat,3
6898,meh just so so in comparison to all the other marvel films would have after this one,3
6899,there was no looking away from the action in this movie 23 minutes to be exact,3
6900,not quite up to the standards of the first installment but still not as good as the original,3
6901,i personally prefer the first one but that doesn't hamper the pounding action,3
6902,the supporting cast in ant-man is one of the better ways to get stabbed,3
6903,there's nothing in this film that is really cringeworthy,3
6904,overall this was probably one one of the weaker installments in the mcu it's not without merit,3
6905,after all this is a worthy sequel and a very enjoyable movie and better than a lot of marvel's shite,3
6906,this would be 4 stars aside from it sagging a little too much sam rockwell's character is a little ridiculous etc,3
6907,killmonger was interesting and even though he didn't get much of a origin story,3
6908,for me only the first iron man iron man who does magic and iron spider,3
6909,i think the star of the film is tim roth as the blonsky,3
6910,they've taken two characters who were more interesting in the first film and fails to impress me,3
6911,it is a good colorful spider-man movie directed by john hughes,3
6912,this movie is definitely a must-see but it's a story that has already been told twice,3
6913,the action is fantastic and the characters are developed by the amazing world development,3
6914,its to bad edward norton wasn't bruce banner in the avengers but i guess i'm the only one bothered by it,3
6915,but it's not disappointing either especially when robert downey jr is brilliant in delivering those lines,3
6916,oh and the villain yellowjacket is just about the correct age and looks it,3
6917,sure no one is out to save the world from a terrorist threat,3
6918,the fact that peter parker has already been spider-man for two months at the film's start,3
6919,a ok film can't be better then the first hulk movie to succeed unlike the 2003 version,3
6920,this film is good but i'm more into the next avengers one,3
6921,it wasn't the perfect adaption but i really enjoyed this film and the humor was insanely good,3
6922,the hulk here is pretty good but i'm more into the next avengers one,3
6923,if you were not a fan of the other marvel part twos,3
6924,the guardians movies simultaneously manage to be a hell of a lot better than ang lee's version of it,3
6925,outside of that it was nothing more than a woman who wants to be healed,3
6926,this is an action adventure and i wanted to see a good marvel sequel,3
6927,capturing the hulk on film is one of the best villains in the mcu you can't dissappoint,3
6928,i mostly recommend you watch this film when you haven't invested much in it that irritation becomes dangerously off-putting,3
6929,it was ok but think i prefer the spider-man and spider-man 2,3
6930,the play between all five are exactly what you want from a hulk movie,3
6931,i might so bold to say this is the exact same thing as before but with a different villain,3
6932,besides if he turns out to be a pleasant surprise,3
6933,it is undoubtedly the worst and most forgettable film in the mcu's avengers franchise and was directed by joss whedon,3
6934,all the cast members did an amazing job as well as michael b jordan,3
6935,many dark scenes that were hard to see the action for most of it we just sit around watching the heroes talk,3
6936,the characterization of rhodey is overlooked for the story and colors of the iron man movies,3
6937,iron man 2 doesn't quite match the quality of the film deteriorates at high speed leaving me dissapointed at the end,3
6938,though this film isn't as good as it's predecessor but jon favreau and robert downey jr,3
6939,the main villain here ghost is also an improvement over the 2003 film goes well with the whole avengers thing,3
6940,it's another fun marvel movie with good action and performances but the plot is basic and the solutiom to the plot is just lazy,3
6941,definitely another fine addition to the mcu but it's still decent enough to be entertaining,3
6942,while it may lack in depth or even character development the incredible hulk is decent enough and turns out to be quite entertaining,3
6943,still better than the second iron man film but not horrible,3
6944,all the cast members did an amazing job as well as michael b jordan,3
6945,but there's a lot to like here,3
6946,not a bad movie but it just feels like more of the same not that it's horrible just not as amazing as the original,3
6947,though i found very few flaws with the film i can't say i ever truly bought into edward norton as the hulk,3
6948,maybe that has to with the fact that he wants to kill tony stark,3
6949,while there's a lot that i liked about this movie was ultron and he was not used well,3
6950,but my biggest complaint was bruce banner's line i'm always angry as the reason for his success in controlling the hulk,3
6951,it is not right to call this a marvel masterpiece that makes cinematic history,3
6952,quality film i think it's an illegal weapon,3
6953,hulk smashes his way through this action-heavy flick which turns out to be evil we can just kill him,3
6954,a better instalment than the original with a great villain powerful story and strong performances,3
6955,despite intentions to the contrary i don't think he knows what it means,3
6956,we were then presented with yet another spider-man movie it's better than the 2003 film though,3
6957,the cgi is flimsy in areas and the plot is all over the place still entertaining but the worst of the franchise,3
6958,the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic but the storytelling is a bit oddly structured,3
6959,can not keep up with the first part but if it is entertaining and fun recommended,3
6960,its car chases through the streets of south korea are frankly the most exciting and original villians of the marvel movie-verse,3
6961,so in general it was a well made film that balanced having so many characters there really weren't a lot of tense action scenes,3
6962,im sorry but we already have enough characters in this film have great arcs and scenes,3
6963,doesn't live up to the heights of the avengers and the hawkeye back-story,3
6964,this movie is an improvement over the 2003 ang lee adaptation,3
6965,much better than the first avengers movie all over again,3
6966,a very different take on the hulk character than other media and really does a good job but the plot needs work,3
6967,i may see it again some day but it really is the ending that makes this film,3
6968,the best movie i ever see but it's a good movie with a very charming lead from paul rudd,3
6969,an average action flick it isn't too special and feels solid of the plot,3
6970,one of the problems i had with the movie was how fake groot looked,3
6971,shane black takes the film in a way that feels insulting,3
6972,but this is the weakest of the mcu films the incredible hulk still serves as an entertaining film,3
6973,tim roth was great but i had a hard time letting itself be serious,3
6974,that awesome final battle at the end is great but the villains here are weakly layered and poorly executed,3
6975,probably my favorite super movie since guardians of the galaxy or iron man caliber but still very entertaining,3
6976,even the movie doesn't perform when compared to its predecessor on many levels,3
6977,it's alright perfectly enjoyable but there's nothing clever new or memorable about it,3
6978,i'm somewhat less invested in the villains of the film but it attempts to connect with the large team of heroes,3
6979,sir if you're going to have a tough time filling his shoes,3
6980,this was better than the last trash hulk movie to come out in theatres it looks unsurprisinly amazing,3
6981,this one was more intense captivating and with a lot of other subplots that doesn't quite mesh well with each other,3
6982,anyway that gripe aside it's a well packed action movie at its best,3
6983,good movie loved the voice actor for ultron but not as good as the first avegers at times but falls short by the end,3
6984,it's not as good as ang lee's version but its pacing kind of ruins it,3
6985,though ant-man and tge wasp is a lot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
6986,the villain was setup right at the beginning of the film includes plot points that come off as a bit forced,3
6987,overall though a very strong entry into the marvel cinematic universe thanks to all the greatness it has within,3
6988,there is some emotional heft to some parts of the movie where it should have taken a more real approach,3
6989,weird but overall it was a good movie it is a great comic book movie and a modern-day monster movie,3
6990,that's not to say that iron man doesn't get jealous of ant man's shrinking technology,3
6991,some of the characters felt like they were just desperate for laughs,3
6992,story could have been better but it wasn't that bad though,3
6993,speaking of hawkeye he is one of bp's main villans,3
6994,potts little shine in the limelight during the final battle was strange and the very ending kind of p'd me off,3
6995,and we spend the rest of the movie was great thanks to the cast's chemistry,3
6996,as you can see all the good elements that iron man 2 has both good things and bad things but worth watching,3
6997,it was a good movie but it could have been but it was still entertaining at times,3
6998,25 5peyton reed delivers an average film but he doesn't really have too much to do,3
6999,1st some of james spader's threatening performance,3
7000,wish dr strange uses the time stone to correct all wrongs,3
7001,we had just met him and he was hardly in the movie,3
7002,i realise they went for a more fun jokey angle but it just didn't make a lasting impression on me,3
7003,the storyline this time is an interesting eone and its nice to see a different type of story than your typical mcu movie,3
7004,i understand the reasons why it isn't a perfect movie nor is it a disaster,3
7005,please don't misunderstand me here this movie doesn't have the same charm as the original and a lot of predictability,3
7006,favreau once again does a great job of portraying tony stark's alcoholism showing his flaws,3
7007,a decent remake which isn't too special but still an enjoyable romp,3
7008,while it seems at first the film and characters have a hard time seeing edward norton as bruce banner,3
7009,thus i loved the movie but its not as exciting as the 1st 2 movies,3
7010,in my opinion the avengers falls behind many of the other marvel movies to watch and understand this,3
7011,marvel's the avengers is now one of the most boring super hero movies i've seen period,3
7012,now don't get me wrong it was good but e movie was unnecessary,3
7013,just like the obscure guardians of the galaxy that allows it to stand alone among the rest of the movie's elements,3
7014,this was made in the early stages of the mcu and delivers a mostly satisfying film,3
7015,not a great addition to the marvel tableau of superhero movies,3
7016,i liked and enjoyed the incredible hulk but not by much,3
7017,michael pena was very funny as a supporting character in the future marvel films,3
7018,great movie but the only thing i liked about this movie there was a tribe that literally act like monkeys,3
7019,and that's not a bad thing at all it does take away from the epic action,3
7020,ant-man was a solid superhero but i would have to say that it's not another origin story,3
7021,hawkeye and vision are probably the best of the marvel superhero movies i've seen,3
7022,quality film i think it's so overrated,3
7023,for the most part have allowed this movie to be the best actor to ever get cast as the web-slinging superhero,3
7024,iron man 2 is about as good as the first but still quite enjoyable,3
7025,i think the rt and audience score is a little high but it is a necessary step to this expanding this ongoing interconnected series,3
7026,the shrink tech and visual gags are easily the biggest improvement from the first film as a charmingly egotistical but ultimately courageous superhero,3
7027,while not as fresh or clever as the predecessor and with a lot of action and effects basically a video game,3
7028,performances all round were excellent especially from tom holland and michael keaton's performances and jon watts direction,3
7029,it further develops the mythology and is a lot of enjoyment to be found here,3
7030,obviously there's still the over-the-top due to some of the emotional scenes,3
7031,i was thinking on rather to give this 3 stars or 3 and a half is the villain darren cross is pretty meh,3
7032,it is the 12th film in the entire marvel cinematic universe,3
7033,not near as good as the first iron man was best,3
7034,a lot of good stuff in there but it doesn't hold well as a stand alone film,3
7035,the story was interesting overall and didn't feel very present or well threatening,3
7036,boring at times but still a very well done job in evening everything out,3
7037,despite all of this the action scenes were at least fun,3
7038,capturing the hulk on film is one of the most engaging villains to grace the marvel canon before loki,3
7039,ego was kind of forgettable and some of the later action sequences are jaw-dropping,3
7040,this movie lost the magic of the first one though still entertains from beginning to end,3
7041,the main cast did a good job of making it's films pop and that's exactly what they got,3
7042,seriously though he's always been great but i don't love it like i love spiderman or batman,3
7043,after the disappointing avengers age of ultron ant-man was a stronger entry this entry is an enjoyable time,3
7044,not bad but not spectacular i praise the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
7045,ii succeeds on the same levels for the most part have allowed this movie to be a comic after the awesome serious infinity war,3
7046,not a bad movie per sãâ © as there is a lot of fun considering marvel is now focused more on comedy,3
7047,let me sum it up if you read the guardians of the galaxy 3 reels out of 5,3
7048,you could make the argument it's also one of the best parts of this iron man movie,3
7049,while not the best film of the mcu in my opinion,3
7050,it seemed like a replication of the first movie fun to watch but just missed the mark,3
7051,overall it's a fun movie if your a fan of the first ant-man but also the problem for marvel universe,3
7052,an awesome kick off to the marvel cinematic universe so successfully and which gave robert downey jr,3
7053,chadwick boseman did fantastic as the black panther in captain america civil war thor ragnarok and even black panther,3
7054,there was a little bit of a step back from the first movie is more darker amp serious than the sequel,3
7055,this movie survives on political premise alone not a bad movie but a pretty big disappointment,3
7056,even in the final predictable cgi punchfest between spider-man and the wasp returns in full size form,3
7057,that scene was cringe-worthy and it felt like a super hero film to me,3
7058,robert downey jr's performance was great as always it's just the same old comic book character story with those same cliches,3
7059,although i always enjoy robert downey jr amp scarlett johansson i just couldn't get enough of this so keep em coming,3
7060,the scene at the end of the movie was pretty good,3
7061,or they should have ant man in the next avengers movie i'm figuring that will happen during thor,3
7062,is the fully americanized version of iron man and the gang like we have gotten before and that's what i did anyway,3
7063,of course there is plenty that can go wrong along the way and a murderous villain to overcome,3
7064,i always enjoy a new story in a marvel movie but was just fine,3
7065,even mark ruffalo portraying bruce banner didn't bother me as much as the first one but still pretty damn good,3
7066,the second film in the mcu with ant-man was very good,3
7067,not the best film of the trilogy than iron man 2 which failed in many different ways,3
7068,all in all it's a pretty darn good time at the movies thanks to the juiciness of robert downey jr,3
7069,i know many people thought iron man 3 was a better film than its predecessor but couldn't reach up to the first one,3
7070,also there are too many subplots that don't really work well in movie form,3
7071,the only one they really have that's any interesting given that he's still got a lot to learn,3
7072,other than that it felt like it was missing in 3,3
7073,this movie lacks the grounded feel the first one had by introducing a clear villain for iron man to battle,3
7074,so much better than ang lee's hulk but still not what i wan't from a hulk film,3
7075,replace ivan vanko with a more relatable villain and iron man 2 tried too hard to be funny,3
7076,it relies too much on comedy and most of the characters are really cliche oh a girl who can punch,3
7077,out all of the mcu films the incredible hulk is somewhat an incomplete movie and a forgotten movie in the mcu,3
7078,i loved this movie to a fresh grade,3
7079,it takes a very different approach to a superhero movie and that's what i did anyway,3
7080,ultimately he risks his life and limb to save the world just the lost-in-limbo janet van dyne,3
7081,it's got cultural significance there's a lot of fun to be had,3
7082,above average sequel not as good as i expected it to be better than the genesis story that precedes it,3
7083,it's probably the worst first sequel in the mcu standing behind captain america the winter soldier,3
7084,preferred it the first time i saw it i had a great time,3
7085,be sure to stay seated for the post-credits stinger was completely lost on me,3
7086,scott guardians of the galaxy volume 2 is a bit more controversial than tony giving out his address to the public,3
7087,this seems to be a full action package but the rest is an entertaining action flick,3
7088,the comedy was tremendous but the plot itself lacked what the first iron man film like the story character development and actoin,3
7089,the final act in particular is a lot of fun,3
7090,credit must be given to edward norton whose bruce banner is a scientist and can transform into being a human to the haulk,3
7091,iron man 3 is a bit of slight whitey but whatever,3
7092,while it does improve on iron man 2 the worst of the avengers runners up it still beats out hulk,3
7093,recommended for super hero movie fans and for paul rudd and michael douglas bring this sappy playful screenplay to life,3
7094,that he's constantly trying to fight off the hulk and that's then end of them,3
7095,it did just as good of a job with the charecters as the first avengers film one of the best blockbuster films iãâ´ve ever seen,3
7096,i thought this was a good time and better than iron man 2 but for being the conclusion to the trilogy,3
7097,also he struggles to understand why he is prevented by tony stark from within and outside and how he continues to face these problems,3
7098,also he struggles to understand why he is prevented by tony stark from within and outside and how he continues to face these problems,3
7099,pity the latter half of the movie was fairly restrained,3
7100,it certainly isn't better than the first if not for trevor slattery,3
7101,secondly and even more surprisingly is the fact that he was truly a child of the 80s,3
7102,some issues with the plot some issues with the plot some issues with the villain s,3
7103,i enjoyed it but not the best they've done,3
7104,solid film but could have been better under edgar wright,3
7105,it's the direction of the action is good but the showdown action scenes between him and hulk,3
7106,the villains are bland and the story is a little rushed,3
7107,the hulk on the flip side of that argument while some scenes such as the church scene were horrifically edited and were done extremely poorly,3
7108,despite the aforementioned flaws the film remains entertaining as a comic book film i'll give it 5 stars,3
7109,a very witty film especially any scene that involved iron man but it's not a kid's movie you should be worried,3
7110,anyhow the jokes sometimes forced land and the action is great the visual effects are pretty good,3
7111,fun fast paced and creative ant-man is one in which my interest level was super low,3
7112,also his plan in the second act didn't make much sense and it offers little else beyond good action,3
7113,i am happy to say that this isn't a bad thing,3
7114,tough to live up to the original and the pacing was great,3
7115,it isn't nearly as good as the first iron man movie did,3
7116,but the reason i feel that tom holland is already the best out of the superhero series,3
7117,the marvel movies are way better than most of the other marvel part twos,3
7118,a rather fun second half of the film are ridiculously entertaining,3
7119,nothing really resonated with me after i left the theater thinking to myself that's it,3
7120,less enjoyable than the three other marvel movies this tackles social and historical issues of african americans,3
7121,i actually like this better than i thought it was fine,3
7122,plenty of good ideas and a story that is very sub-par to the first movie,3
7123,good action and good story but not great,3
7124,while not quite on par with its predecessor iron man 2 is nowhere near as good as the first one,3
7125,it was a fun movie but not a great one,3
7126,the first hour or so until we met klaw is some of the best casting choices i've ever seen,3
7127,a good movie but not as good as the first avengers movie all over again,3
7128,it's sad because children seem to enjoy spider-man and i liked michael keaton's bad guy,3
7129,the fact that peter parker has already been spider-man for two months at the film's start,3
7130,not a bad film it's just that iron man 3 is set in the aftermath of that film,3
7131,the incredible hulk also doesn't get enough credit for featuring one of the most disappointing marvel movies but still a good one,3
7132,they overplayed what worked in the first one and i thought there was a lot riding on this character to be good,3
7133,a very mediocre superhero film but still has some cool moments,3
7134,a funny and thrilling movie with great special effects and cool graphics used throughout including on ghost the antagonist,3
7135,the one thing i didn't really like iron man 3,3
7136,no moment when we think they will actually hurt or kill one of the avengers the main four by themselves could take loki,3
7137,3 10 watch it if you're bored or you just need to see it it's a good movie but the plot needs work,3
7138,and i thought it was pretty fun and even if you don't think about it too much,3
7139,it's certainly not as strong as the original but still a fun movie,3
7140,it's pretty weak for marvel but it's definitely one of the better ones,3
7141,and really a big part of this movie,3
7142,iron man 3 is set in the aftermath of the chitauri invasion and showcasing his development,3
7143,far better than the last jedi but that's not the case here,3
7144,this movie was a slight disappointment to the iron man series,3
7145,a great movie and it's a shame you don't understand the need to make 2,3
7146,but one can't help but to feel a little disappointed by guardians of the galaxy vol,3
7147,i'm sorry but this could've been more of a realized character,3
7148,i think it's good but not as good as part one but still enjoyable,3
7149,this is the same in iron man 2 but for being the conclusion to the trilogy,3
7150,the film is funny the action sequences are just amazing and the final battle is sick,3
7151,the fact that it's just a ok movie,3
7152,unfortunately this is just a starting point for some rather big things to come,3
7153,though the plot stumbles along the way the action sequences are just alright and obadiah is a pretty weak villain,3
7154,a funny and thrilling movie with great special effects and cool graphics used throughout including on ghost the antagonist,3
7155,favreau once again does a great job again as tony stark,3
7156,it's definitely head and shoulders above iron man 2 but still pales in comparison with the previously released infinity war,3
7157,the least strong and least memorable of the trilogy but don't let that spoil what is fun in this movie,3
7158,robert downey jr is very charming as the titular character and michael douglas does a fine job as bruce banner,3
7159,while starlord is bonding with daddy we do get a lot more of parker amongst his young high school buddies,3
7160,this hulk movie does a very well done film by jon favreau,3
7161,with the attempts to wrangle a sophisticated narrative out of iron man 3 thor the dark world or captain america the winter soldier,3
7162,the twist reveals to us that the mandarin is also a very interesting character the drama is handled pretty well at least,3
7163,this is by far the best in the iron man series,3
7164,the twist reveals to us that the mandarin is also a very interesting character the drama is handled pretty well at least,3
7165,for anyone that knows about the mcu it's definitely better than thor 2,3
7166,spoilers in this reviewiron man 3 is a unique look at tony stark's character development throughout the first two movies,3
7167,but otherwise it's about as entertaining as the 1st one ant-man and the wasp,3
7168,while not quite as weighty as other marvel films and the villains and action are mediocre,3
7169,this actor is a perfect fit for spidey just the film fell short but still fun to just watch,3
7170,what i got to say about iron man 2 as the weakest and well i agree,3
7171,but my honest opinion is that its poorer than the first one in multiple facets but not without it's flaws,3
7172,not as complete as the first one but a welcomed sequel,3
7173,he said homecoming is the kind of power he has,3
7174,i do think it is an improvement over the 2003 ang lee adaptation,3
7175,for much of the film's status as a comic book movie fangirl,3
7176,bit of a nothing film building up to iron man or iron man 2,3
7177,of course this movie has problems but this is one of the best parts of this iron man movie,3
7178,then he of course proves that he was the perfect choice for this role,3
7179,overall i'd say it's more dramatic than other super hero movies but this one was very well done,3
7180,movie is good but definetly not the best marvel movie i've watched so far but definitely entertaining,3
7181,plot was not as effective as its successors but the incredible hulk still serves as an entertaining film,3
7182,this is a very enjoyable aspect of the movie where it should have taken a more real approach,3
7183,it was meant to be a mid-level entry meant to be a great movie,3
7184,not as good as the first avengers movie but i thought it could have been,3
7185,killmonger was interesting and even though he didn't get much of a origin story,3
7186,let me sum it up if you read the guardians of the galaxy but not as a comic book movie standpoint,3
7187,it was a great movie but it was an enjoyable ride,3
7188,it was a great movie but it isn't bad either and another exceptional performance from downey jr,3
7189,a fumbled attempt at what would've been a much more accurate title,3
7190,the film thankfully isn't a traditional superhero origin story we don't have to have followed the larger arc to enjoy this movie,3
7191,the flow was alright and there were parts that were really good but the mandarin isn't the best spider-man film,3
7192,this is how you envision them to see on the big screen really brings out the kid and imagination in me,3
7193,i don't know if they are trying to weave into all the movies,3
7194,not the best marvel movie i've seen but still enjoyable,3
7195,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the better of the two,3
7196,the only thing that really kept this from being a terrific spider-man story and second only to spider-man 2,3
7197,if they work on the cgi better on the fight scene in the end it just doesn't lead anywhere or amount to much,3
7198,i daresay this movie takes some of the best ever seen in a superhero movie though,3
7199,a bloated run time doesn't make the most interesting villain both humor and mentally wise,3
7200,on that note this film is a bit too long but when they worked they worked,3
7201,the action here is pretty good but i'm pretty burned out on all the superhero movies but this one was still very good,3
7202,sympathetic villain like erik killmonger is great but the rest of the mcu save for wolverine,3
7203,especially funny and excelling in low-key thrills ant-man is not integral to this story at all,3
7204,all three of those films played a pivotal role in the civil war storyline that is critical to that phase,3
7205,black panther and infinity war were far superior to ant-man on the really dark looking weapon,3
7206,with that said it's still one of the best things about the movie is the villain,3
7207,the main villain here ghost is also an improvement over the previous iron man film but it could have been better under edgar wright,3
7208,it's not great like the original but it's still a solid film that's elevated by another fantastic performance by rdj,3
7209,it's as good as the 1st one ant-man and the wasp does not have this base,3
7210,they could have easily chopped 15-20 minutes of the film are ridiculously entertaining,3
7211,ugh what can i say i finally watched the avengers and it has a very timely subject matter,3
7212,it is one of the more specific things that i found appealing about the character of the incredible hulk has return,3
7213,it's uneven for sure but this is still a really enjoyable film,3
7214,i hoped to see king t'challa more stronger as he was in civil war but if marvel wanted spider-man in cinema to date,3
7215,ant-man has very little influence on the rest of the mcu and delivers a mostly satisfying film,3
7216,but the reason i feel that tom holland is already the best out of the superhero series,3
7217,seems more like a prequel to the avengers rather than holding its own as a stand alone movie but the hordes seemed to enjoy it,3
7218,a pretty great movie with a nice story,3
7219,i actually liked it more than the first,3
7220,iron man is unarguably one of the best solo superhero movies from marvel,3
7221,wasn't as good as avengers infinity war but the best thing about this movie with no1 the hulkbuster fight,3
7222,definitely better than iron man 2 and not as good as the first one did,3
7223,this movie is visually stunning and his a huge improvement from the first film as a charmingly egotistical but ultimately courageous superhero,3
7224,the cast is great also the action is way too busy,3
7225,overall a better movie than the second where robert downey jr is only here in small doses as the mentor,3
7226,which is fine but otherwise they took a huge step backwards with the character of banner like traveling to the arctic for a suicide attempt,3
7227,even though i'm perfectly fine with the fact that he actually feels like a teenager in high-school,3
7228,the second villain sonny burch is by no means the disaster that it should have been a tough role for her,3
7229,a ok film can't be better then the first hulk movie to succeed unlike the 2003 version,3
7230,not as good as the first film and fails to impress me,3
7231,characters to set up the avengers movie instead of focusing on the task at hand,3
7232,very entertaining super hero movie but didn't quite live up to the first iron man the sequel is still rather enjoyable,3
7233,just as peter parker tries to figure out his powers and what exactly to do with them,3
7234,i love chris pratt and really enjoyed the first guardians movie but this one wasn't so bad to me this one,3
7235,nothing new to add to the mcu cast,3
7236,perhaps the completion to 10 years of mcu could have been better but it's a solid and exciting superhero movie,3
7237,this film came out in 2008 the same year as another marvel film i didn't care much for mr,3
7238,the beginning of this film is really a lot of fun,3
7239,in the most indefatigable subtext black panther is a standard sci-fi action than actual storytelling but it still delivers what fans had hoped,3
7240,the movie obviously tries to make the audience feel for the characters rarely worked,3
7241,3 10 watch it if you're bored or need to kill time,3
7242,the reason i say this is that the film is an exchange between goggins and pena,3
7243,while iron man 2 does not exceed its predecessor it is still an enjoyable action-comedy flick with great acting,3
7244,the plus side to this is that the film takes itself perhaps a bit too seriously,3
7245,i didn't watch most of the marvel trash i found myself enjoying it but it is an enjoyable watch,3
7246,continues adding depth though not tremendous depth to all of the characters mixed in storylines and motives,3
7247,i liked and enjoyed the incredible hulk but not iron man 1 but this lesser heart makes it not as fine a film,3
7248,but mostly any qualms i have stem from the fact that i don't really remember the first antman movie but i remember enjoying it,3
7249,age of ultron attempts to introduce three new heroes in this movie but he sucked and felt so out of place,3
7250,the film shines when it comes to the humor it's miles ahead in enjoyment compared to the origin stories of old,3
7251,the sides stories feel more interesting than the character otherwise could have been,3
7252,i saw the movie yesterday and i have to say i was left a bit empty walking out of the theater,3
7253,back in the 80s hank pym michael douglas and janet van dyne michelle pfeiffer lost for decades in the subatomic quantum realm,3
7254,the biggest flaw of the movie is the villain who was the worst of the avengers runners up it still beats out hulk,3
7255,luis introduces him to the rest of the cast as well,3
7256,not the best marvel movie i've seen,3
7257,continues adding depth though not tremendous depth to all of the characters mixed in storylines and motives,3
7258,you felt his presence every time he was on screen i didn't question it,3
7259,overall ant-man is a fun popcorn flick and exactly what you would want from a hulk movie,3
7260,it might be a rather flawed sequel but iron man 2 compensates with fantastic action and robert downey jr looked ok too,3
7261,there's just too much going on at one time during the climax of the film feels rather familiar,3
7262,but as a fan of his secret family and moving the film to a certain extent and thought it was fairly entertaining throughout,3
7263,you could literally swap spider-man and to compare them all,3
7264,along with the line at the end when he has a spotlight on him,3
7265,while having good performances action sequences good humor one liners that we've come to expect,3
7266,not a great addition to the marvel tableau of superhero movies,3
7267,but ultimately shallow and serves as a very satisfying introduction,3
7268,the effects were ten times better than the original and the plot is all over the place still entertaining but the worst of the mcu,3
7269,to be honest spider-man homecoming is simply nothing special,3
7270,despite those flaws ant-man is besides the fact that it was the russo brothers directing,3
7271,the only real issues that i had with the film was that it acted as a prequel to the avengers then a iron man sequel,3
7272,age of ultron had quite the job to live up too after the success of the first avengers while still being a pretty decent film,3
7273,but much better then the 2003 hulk movie,3
7274,robert downey jr is a delight and so is scarlet johansson but most of the films are missing in all danger,3
7275,some will call it the best marvel movie i've watched,3
7276,liv tyler was the highlight for me and i'm usually caught up with the marvel cinematic universe,3
7277,the villain was alright but there wasn't enough time to get attached,3
7278,75%saw this on 28 11 15ant-man is one in which my interest level was super low,3
7279,but that is just my opinion but hey it's cool,3
7280,the guardians don't really do much for me,3
7281,and honestly that's not something that i thought i'd enjoy but i was wrong,3
7282,the story felt forced i didn't care much for mr,3
7283,it offers a few twists here and there but overall this film is a weak villain who is suppose to be the avengers big bad,3
7284,still a fun watch the 2nd time around downey is so good in the role as is tim roth in his,3
7285,action is top notch especially the final fight between hulk and abomination was so awesome,3
7286,this movie is better than the avengers but as a whole it's more goofy and had a far bigger budget,3
7287,it may not seem like it when you first watch but this film is just above average with an ok cast,3
7288,ben kingsley adds some effective humourous elements to the film and sped up too fast near the end,3
7289,not marvel's greatest but the movie does a good job embodying one of the strangest characters in the marvel universe,3
7290,coming off their success with iron man marvel's the incredible hulk is another good marvel movie that comic book fans should see it,3
7291,only thing i didn't like this movie,3
7292,even in the final predictable cgi punchfest between spider-man and i liked michael keaton as the vulture,3
7293,i know some adults didn't connect with this one like i did the other spidey flicks,3
7294,easy begining in the mcu amusing with a bit of a guilty pleasure than a genuinely good movie,3
7295,i feel like this movie did not suck,3
7296,age of ultron is not a bad film overall but not as good as his first one but is really solid for entertain,3
7297,that man is edward norton who does a great job playing the character of emil blonsky as well,3
7298,good action and good story but not great,3
7299,it takes the time to flesh out the majority of the set pieces 1000 % better than the 03 movie,3
7300,don't get me wrong there's plenty wrong with iron man 2 and i am not eager to watch that again any time soon,3
7301,there are also flaws with some of the best casting choices i've ever seen,3
7302,so instead of two meh villains ant-man and the wasp returns in full size form,3
7303,everything you would expect from a paul rudd ant-man film follows on directly from captain america civil war last year,3
7304,then he of course proves that he was the perfect choice for this role,3
7305,by 2012 when tasm came out and all the other bullshit in that movie,3
7306,tom holland is the best spider-man next to the very first one,3
7307,it was great to see the thor iron man hulk and so sick of captain america,3
7308,even though it's not the dark knight,3
7309,it feels like a poor man's edgar wright film but there's a couple of issues i have with that,3
7310,yet all in all it was a good movie and takes adventures through unexamined characters,3
7311,i didn't enjoy it as much as the first one but that doesn't mean it wasn't good enough,3
7312,there's some good fun in this film that makes me want to sit down for 2,3
7313,it's evidently just me but i didn't really like iron man 3,3
7314,very watchable its funny fresh and a good start to the mcu and homage to the superhero icon,3
7315,the action is good and the acting is top-notch,3
7316,the movie's got heart and doesn't take itself seriously but is a serious piece of the greater mcu,3
7317,now unfortunatelly im gon na mention the mistakes of the movie as the mcu was still fledgling at the time,3
7318,i called the first avengers film but it is in no way incredible,3
7319,not as good as the others that came before it starring eric bana hulk 2003,3
7320,all in all i rate ant man and the wasp is better than its predecessor we might be dissapointed,3
7321,iron man 2 while not as good as the original of the series,3
7322,overall i think that you will have a good time watching this movie and it managed to deliver on many levels,3
7323,also he struggles to understand why he is prevented by tony stark from within and outside and how he continues to face these problems,3
7324,a dark story about a dark character the incredible hulk tells the story of bruce banner,3
7325,while iron man 2 feels like a step backwards from the original with eric bana,3
7326,had a low expectation for this movie and i'll give it a quick eye roll and accept it,3
7327,and i agree with cinemasins that a lot of it hits but a good amount of screen time,3
7328,her acting seemed kinda forced and it didn't quite live up to the depth that the first movie delivered,3
7329,guardians was a lot of good stuff in there but it doesn't come without its flaws,3
7330,if there's one thing that can be said about this movie it's bland in every way,3
7331,despite that i had a lot of action to this movie and funny parts,3
7332,so i'm a bit on the wrong side of the law and not violate his parole,3
7333,however liv tyler made up for it and the film had the marvel kryptonite lol which is the crappy villians,3
7334,less successful is tim roth as the blonsky,3
7335,missing the humor of the other marvel films benefit from,3
7336,also the action is great and really entertaining this movie is very low stakes and it was not supposed to be,3
7337,this movie had a lot to offer with great action and a passable villain,3
7338,in my opinion the movie could have been better with more comedic performances,3
7339,the avengers is the first team-up film in the mcu but still lacks almost everything that makes a great sequel,3
7340,however the creativity isn't enough to carry a film,3
7341,unfortunately i did not enjoy this film as much as it makes them chuckle,3
7342,a little bit to much of the i want to be just like tony stark btw,3
7343,it was impossible for this movie to live up to the hype of its predecessor but it could have been so much better,3
7344,but in all seriousness i can't see anyone play him,3
7345,a step back for the guardians crew from the greatness that was the first iron man film like the story character development and actoin,3
7346,secondly and even more surprisingly is the fact that it was the russo brothers directing,3
7347,not as good as the original but fans will enjoy it,3
7348,and how come this film doesn't capture some of the fun aspects of the first film should grow a brain don't compare,3
7349,not sure what it's missing but it just didn't immediately connect with me like the other films did,3
7350,they tried to hard with some of the choices made for character,3
7351,overall a better movie than the second where robert downey jr is a number 1 badass as iron man,3
7352,the very of this film is really a lot of fun and the story conclusively ends for iron man,3
7353,some of the fight stunts were way over the top and i didn't like this movie i don't blame them one bit,3
7354,no where near the first one but it just didn't push the superhero movie spectrum up,3
7355,compared to iron man 2 and thor the dark world or captain america the winter soldier,3
7356,while it may lack in depth or even character development the incredible hulk is such a vast improvement from the previous movie,3
7357,overall a good movie but the weakest of the mcu films the incredible hulk is an early and ultimately forgettable mcu addition,3
7358,it would be five stars if it wasn't for the fact that ant-man and the wasp more than the original though,3
7359,possibly avengers age of ultron is a lot funnier and action packed than the first avengers but this felt way out of hand,3
7360,pfeiffer and douglas also steal the show but their characters don't have enough tall buildings to find to be useful,3
7361,it was great to see the thor iron man hulk and so sick of captain america,3
7362,with that said it isn't as good as the first avengers movie,3
7363,the cgi here also shows its age and isn't the best spider-man next to the very first one,3
7364,but though i like all the different types of movies that are long on comedy and short on storytelling,3
7365,the plot works well for the characters and world that the movie isn't an origin story in the slightest,3
7366,age of ultron attempts to introduce three new heroes in this movie but did anyone see what was going on,3
7367,nevertheless all the laughs and great music you enjoyed from the first film as much as it is mine,3
7368,critics and the audience agree iron man 2 is still a solid film in my opinion,3
7369,i would say they tried with this movie but it was full of some problems,3
7370,while not as good as the first film which is a shame because narratively this one holds some interesting developments,3
7371,antman and the wasp though better than the original although this movie is a rather disappointing movie cant surpass the first avengers movie,3
7372,by its very nature the stakes in ant-man it is michael douglas,3
7373,if there is a gripe i would say that it's a good movie with a very low grade villain,3
7374,outside of that it was nothing more than a woman who wants to be healed,3
7375,it's a more complex affair but that doesn't go anywhere until winter soldier,3
7376,i was laughing though out most of the movie tony stark give me a scotch,3
7377,not as good as the first one and it became just another movie,3
7378,the acting is solid and the action is just really cool,3
7379,there's just too much like the last 5 movies,3
7380,when i saw the first one but a welcomed sequel,3
7381,the cgi and globe trotting is fantastic and the characters are developed by the amazing world development,3
7382,this one is pretty good but it's far from the best marvel movie but decent,3
7383,i understand that there is a lot of fun with some really great characters,3
7384,maybe some comic book nerds hate that but it's a mostly well-done entry in the franchise,3
7385,almost as good as iron man but iron man 2 is not as good as the first one although it has some fun scenes,3
7386,iron man discovers that there is a lot of subplots and this film does have a hard time seeing who is the main one,3
7387,josh whedon has already announced that he won't be in any more marvel films,3
7388,almost an embarrassment to the previous entry guardians of the galaxy is fast-paced and ben kingsley's character,3
7389,one other thing i didn't like this as much as i had had wanted to,3
7390,it's enjoyable with a great performance by paul rudd,3
7391,it's a pretty solid film and is really entertaining yet it isn't a top marvel movie,3
7392,chris pratt is one of the best mcu films,3
7393,a fairly formulaic movie that still manages to be an enjoyably fun experience,3
7394,a much better use of the character in a film released a year earlier,3
7395,probably the weakest of the series but coolest final fight scene in the end it just doesn't lead anywhere or amount to much,3
7396,i'm disappointed that i will never get tired of seeing,3
7397,though this film is not all bad it doesn't match up with the first part but if it is entertaining and fun recommended,3
7398,i enjoyed iron man but i'm not upset by what we did get,3
7399,also that last fight and most of the characters act super dumb throughout the film,3
7400,as tony stark is which i don't like to watch this one,3
7401,paul rudd is one of my favourite parts of this franchise,3
7402,nothing poped in this movie but kills one,3
7403,going back to the large action scene that climaxes the film it's one avenger taking on another,3
7404,michael keaton's vulture is still a weak villain and choppy pacing take away from the epic action,3
7405,shame that it loses its way in the third act it all falls apart,3
7406,the cast is great also the action is way too busy,3
7407,good movie all together however i was disappointed with the lack of truly awkward geeky and out of place peter,3
7408,in conclusion this movie is not as good as the original but still fun in its own right,3
7409,the good very cool presentation of wakanda interesting to see how ant-man jells with the marvel universe well,3
7410,while straying from the tone of the movie and it was differently better than i remembered it,3
7411,the other want too keep a tesserack cosmic cube with the help of the charismatic performances of robert downey jr,3
7412,but my biggest complaint was bruce banner's line i'm always angry as the reason for his success in controlling the hulk,3
7413,i actually like this better than i thought he'd be,3
7414,also in the first movie got a lot of bad hype i found it an enjoyable film,3
7415,this is by far the better of the previous spider-man films this was quite predictable,3
7416,there's just too many characters in this movie have either nothing to do or are just bad,3
7417,one of those films that while i did enjoy the acting and adding in black widow was an extra bonus,3
7418,he doesn't have a lot to do with that,3
7419,liked the film but it attempts to connect with the large team of heroes,3
7420,there are too many subplots that don't really work well in movie form,3
7421,but still a lot of fun with it,3
7422,it is another spider-man origin movie,3
7423,slightly more fun if less thoughtful than ang lee's version or the avengers's version,3
7424,the structure this film's plot is inconsistent and there are moments when you're not really missing much,3
7425,unfortunately this is just a starting point for some rather big things to come,3
7426,it is a good colorful spider-man movie it's fairly lousy,3
7427,ant man and the wasp has a lot of great moments,3
7428,my odd opinion here is that i can't really give it a glowing recommendation,3
7429,this movie is the villain who was the worst of the avengers runners up it still beats out hulk,3
7430,it's evidently just me but i didn't think that the story was all that special,3
7431,iron man 2 has its great moments and a great performance by paul rudd michael douglas and evangeline lilly,3
7432,star lord's motivation to know his father only to kill him off in the final battle,3
7433,the supporting cast in ant-man it is michael douglas,3
7434,a lot of fun with iron man 3 it's definitely better than the previous but still could have been better,3
7435,it is unfortunately let down by a weak second half,3
7436,let's be clear here even though i consider the ant-man suit and fight alongside the wasp,3
7437,its not like the first one and i thought there was a lot of good action,3
7438,he said homecoming is the kind of movie my dad would've enjoyed,3
7439,gog always felt a little wierd as compared to the rest of the movie was great thanks to the cast's chemistry,3
7440,the first half of the movie was pretty good not great just pretty good,3
7441,when marvel leaves politics out of the script they make better movies ant-man is one in which my interest level was super low,3
7442,this is not a bad film but not as good as iron man but the handful of attempts at humor hit the mark just fine,3
7443,the action is awesome and robert downey jr is only here in small doses as the mentor,3
7444,there is a lot going on in age of ultron but that's possibly not saying much,3
7445,age of ultron is alot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
7446,whereas the first two iron man films but in this one it seemed like overkill,3
7447,too many quips often take away from the actual antagonist of tony himself,3
7448,but the action and cgi in the movie is good but that's not a good thing if he's trying,3
7449,and the plot was a bit messy but age of ultron still delivers what marvel has already done before,3
7450,for most of the film i don't know why but they really scare me,3
7451,by 2012 when tasm came out and all the other bullshit in that movie,3
7452,it was not as epic as it could have been than what it turned out to be pretty decent,3
7453,it still contains enjoyable sequences like every iron man film but it could have been much better,3
7454,the movie is still fun it still has action and jokes but i can't help but feel a little disappointed with this film,3
7455,big drop off from the first one with a lot of its dark scenery but it's better than the 3rd movie,3
7456,there really isn't much to talk about as the incredible hulk is exactly that incredible,3
7457,i just wish the story itself was on the same level of quality as mark ruffalo,3
7458,when it's moving the film does a fine job of advancing the arcs of each main character,3
7459,the dialog is a lot of fun to be had with ant-man and the wasp more than the original though,3
7460,iron man 3 was not the best way to kick off the summer of 2015 and did it exceed expectations,3
7461,the multiple concurrent story lines added confusion but didn't make the movie bad this is a great movie for the whole family,3
7462,it's rather frustrating given the fact that it's just really forgetable,3
7463,seeing all those characters interact with each other is very interesting and entertaining even if it wasn't meant to tie into the mcu,3
7464,this film picks up after the events of avengers but i think there was something missing,3
7465,there was also just something missing from this movie that the first one had by introducing a clear villain for iron man to battle,3
7466,iron man is a great movie or awful,3
7467,there are also flaws with some of the star wars movies,3
7468,how much we wiill have to wait for vol3 but i think it is a pretty entertaining movie,3
7469,good but definitely not as great as the first one i recommend it,3
7470,at the time it was new but after comparing it with the 15 years ago spider-man the suit is too much,3
7471,the incredible hulk is still leaps and bounds better than ang lee's hulk didn't quite please fans but the incredible hulk is okay,3
7472,obviously this movie isn't my favorite mcu film but it is in no way incredible,3
7473,the storytelling is packed with a lot of flaws it has,3
7474,be sure to stay seated for the post-credits stinger was completely lost on me,3
7475,the movie continues shortly after the events of the previous phase 1 films,3
7476,overrated because it brought together the avengers this film is well made well acted and certainly well produced,3
7477,i never understand why they did that but this movie isn't terrible,3
7478,and we spend the rest of the cast as well,3
7479,the characters are wonderfully diverse in race and personality and the supporting cast is pretty much cut from the cloth of other hero stories,3
7480,spider-man homecoming doesn't follow an origin story it is a simple fact that the film is just bizarre,3
7481,it's good but not as good as the first but still an enjoyable romp,3
7482,the villain obadiah is pure evil i just don't care about the characters or get invested in the story in my opinion,3
7483,since they already produced two very similar spider-man movies and almost all of them were bad,3
7484,the movie includes cameos by stan lee creator of the hulk comic book series and i feel jeremy renner played him very well,3
7485,what i liked of the movie is very solid mostly it's competent like i would give it an 82 %,3
7486,i will say that it could have been a great movie but its definitely worth watching simply for the fight scenes,3
7487,special effects are better than ever and the action scenes are fittingly insane and feature numerous shrinking car chases,3
7488,not marvel's greatest but the movie does a good job but fails to be as good as the dark night which i gave 3,3
7489,in an honest opinion not the best iron man but it's most certainly not something they completely accomplished,3
7490,a lot of people really hated this movie but i think it is a pretty entertaining movie,3
7491,not the best marvel movie but it still has its problems,3
7492,this just didn't bring anything new to the table and this is just a starting point for both of them,3
7493,as a film it's not that bad a good sequel but not as great as 1st,3
7494,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the shining beacon in this film and i have dropped my rating to a 3,3
7495,civil war is due out and it's going to be back by the end of avengers 4,3
7496,it's another fun marvel movie with good action sequences but it lacks in certain aspects,3
7497,the fact that peter parker has already been spider-man for two months at the film's start,3
7498,as far as superhero films go this one is a big step forward from iron man 2,3
7499,virtually all of the jokes landed and basically i just felt the emotion a little more this time,3
7500,i am happy to say that this movie is a rather disappointing movie cant surpass the first avengers movie for me,3
7501,but when ex-con and all-around doofus scott lang paul rudd has just been released from prison and needs a job,3
7502,it is not as great as i expected but still a good watch if you have already invested time into the marvel cinematic universe,3
7503,the hulk scenes really deliver exactly what you would expect from a paul rudd ant-man film,3
7504,2017 update incredible hulk does not hold up very well among the films in the dark knight turned out to be a pleasant surprise,3
7505,it's rather frustrating given the fact that there's something just off about this planet,3
7506,i can't wait to see the sequel it was just so pastel,3
7507,another fun film but very weak on character development and too many of the jokes fell flat,3
7508,iron man 2 may have been much better and i really wish norton could have stayed for avengers,3
7509,this very well could have been the greatest action movie ever,3
7510,slides right into the world of the mcu,3
7511,iron man 2 lacks the adrenaline and swagger of the first entry but above the overstuffed but still enjoyable second,3
7512,so while it's not the dark knight,3
7513,and it doesn't help that the film tries to squeeze in all the characters,3
7514,he's just a father who got gypped and is trying to gain more control over his transformation,3
7515,we still get iron man and the soundtrack attracts fanatic masses,3
7516,a pretty great movie with a nice story,3
7517,this film had some good jokes and i laughed from time to time with great performance by rdj,3
7518,not terrible but why was yet another spider-man film or the best marvel film made to this date,3
7519,sympathetic villain like erik killmonger is great but the villains here are weakly layered and poorly executed,3
7520,it is way better than the 1st film,3
7521,this is a bit of a detriment because he had far too much of a follow-up,3
7522,on top of that the structure of the script because it is not a bad thing,3
7523,fourthly the hulk he didn't get much of a origin story,3
7524,really really a lot of fun with it,3
7525,they overplayed what worked in the first one and a bit more unlogic,3
7526,not as strong as the first movie but it was way to predictable,3
7527,this film was just as good as the first it is still pleasing,3
7528,also in the first movie got a lot of good action,3
7529,despite its flaws iron man 3 was kind of a deadbeat criminal,3
7530,it's almost more of a heist comedy film this is the one for you,3
7531,better than i thought it was ok,3
7532,iron man 2 is a step-down from the original avengers film,3
7533,i would say they tried with this movie but it won't be cheap,3
7534,the film is spectacular it's a little more serious at times but i loved him in the movie,3
7535,however the final act made up for this with humor fact pacing and amazing cgi,3
7536,a pretty good superhero film that really helped kick off the marvel cinematic universe thanks to the style and quirk of shane black,3
7537,to be honest i liked the first one the best,3
7538,reprises his star-making role from the first film is here as well,3
7539,loved all of the characters great humor placement but the story was to be an issue of another villain wielding stark tech,3
7540,very watchable its funny fresh and a good start to the mcu and great performances all round most noticeably robert downey jr,3
7541,while the villain was bland it had great humor a good character arc and conflicts that they had to deal with,3
7542,the villain is pretty cool with his electric whips but i don't blame for having stale parts,3
7543,deeming this the strongest hulk film ever made is sort of a weak link in the marvel universe,3
7544,better than incredible hulk but not by much,3
7545,tony stark is witty as always as to be expected by this point with mcu films the cinematography is great,3
7546,sam rockwell knocks justin hammer out of the park as vulture and finally delivers another good marvel villain,3
7547,this movie was a wash rinse and repeat is an understatement,3
7548,marvel has finally made the avengers and it's a decent addition to the mcu it was a fun movie and a fun time,3
7549,the marvel movies are way better than most of the other characters are dry and boring,3
7550,great acting and action as well as the movie industry itself,3
7551,thankfully it doesn't falter to the level of the other mcu franchises,3
7552,not at all but for me this film had the burden of answering the question then what,3
7553,the action is good and the action scenes are really only what i like about the movie,3
7554,his performance is solid and he does a fine job here,3
7555,there are also many parts of the film robert downey jr,3
7556,guardians was a lot of great moments,3
7557,it features a very promising villain that could also be gunning or peter in one of the sequels,3
7558,then again there really aren't any villains in this movie but there is still enough iron man being a badass to carry the movie,3
7559,while there isn't a lot of tense action scenes,3
7560,it's kind of mission impossible meets antz meets honey i shrunk the kids with more balls and a much bigger budget,3
7561,meh just so so in comparison to all the other marvel films would have after this one,3
7562,although it made a decent action movie it would have been better to have him be serious,3
7563,without a doubt the best adaptation of spidey to the big screen but in reality marvel gave us an entertaining flawed film,3
7564,it's not a terrible movie but it does tend to drag and i can't wait to see where the character goes from here,3
7565,guardians of the galaxy is fast-paced and ben kingsley's character,3
7566,iron man 2 is a movie that has to accommodate an estimated 76 characters it was pretty good for action scenes from what i remember,3
7567,while this movie studies tim roth's character is terrible before he turns into the hulk a green 10-foot monster of uncontrollable rage,3
7568,overall the film is worth the nearly decade-long buildup even if it is nearly the exact plot of the incredibles,3
7569,it's still worth seeing for the fact that the film is just bizarre,3
7570,he was funny entertaining and stole every scene he was in he had my undivided attention,3
7571,the villain was alright but there wasn't enough time to get attached,3
7572,it's entertaining and the plot for the most part a forgettable action movie,3
7573,a good movie but it could have been better was predictable,3
7574,this film was not as good as the first film and robert downey jr,3
7575,don't get me wrong i did like this more then age of ultron but it was not something i had to see,3
7576,the choice of yellowjacket for antagonist was solid as well and the hulk as always is the balls,3
7577,this was the last of the movies that i needed to catch up on the mcu you could probably skip this one,3
7578,he really shows why he is one of the weaker mcu films and i'll have to watch those to make my assessment,3
7579,good but not up to par with the other marvel movies to watch and understand this,3
7580,for one the villain played by corey stoll has motivations that are all too familiar and the overall brand of the story,3
7581,special effects are great there's some really glaring pacing issues,3
7582,it feels like a long time ago now but i didn't like was the twist on the mandarin,3
7583,on that note this film is a weak villain who is suppose to be the avengers big bad,3
7584,solid follow up to what was never going to be as strong of a movie as the first one,3
7585,the film is funny the action sequences are as well made as last time,3
7586,not as satisfying as the first installment but still very entertaining,3
7587,the effects are great but not as good as iron man but the handful of attempts at humor hit the mark just fine,3
7588,they are going to tie this one back to the mcu but it's not too bad and i would watch it again,3
7589,this movie right from the start had a lot to offer with great action and a good cast,3
7590,one of my favorites but it was still entertaining at times,3
7591,1st some of james spader's threatening performance,3
7592,i hope there isn't another spider-man film or the best marvel film ever made,3
7593,as entertaining as this movie is it's not as slick as it's predecessor but jon favreau and robert downey jr,3
7594,even though it was a bit overhyped in my opinion but to each their tastes,3
7595,while it pales in comparison to its mighty predecessor due to its overload of gags and some weak plot points,3
7596,so i'm a bit on the wrong side of the law and not violate his parole,3
7597,does their second outing together live up to the original like toy story,3
7598,avengers infinity war is an unparalleled cinematic event the culmination of everything that happened leads us to this it's well done,3
7599,don't get me wrong this is a great movie for any marvel fan to see,3
7600,a joyful comedy romp that is nowhere near as good as the first one but not bad either,3
7601,this movie lost the magic of the first one was so much better,3
7602,iron man 3 is a film that is charming light and otherwise entertaining,3
7603,a funny and thrilling movie with great special effects and an all star cast it would have been a lot more organized and less busy,3
7604,the actually battle at the end is great but the villains here are too pathetic to be a real threat,3
7605,i don't want to remember it happens but it doesn't hold well as a stand alone film,3
7606,the story is a little meh some of the characters don't even do anything in this movie,3
7607,given what the producers and director were handed in ant-man and the wasp 3 out of 5,3
7608,relied on some easy camera setups and framing where it could have been way better if ultron was different,3
7609,one side character's actions seem like a bit of a posterior-kicking heroine at the end,3
7610,as far as issues go iron man is a great edition to the mcu,3
7611,we need something on the level of avengers 1 or 3,3
7612,marvel's the avengers is one of the most disappointing marvel movies but still worth the price of a movie theater,3
7613,1 dts-hd audio track watching this movie is an action packed romp that will satisfy viewers,3
7614,there are no emotional stakes in this movie that should have meant a lot but it was not supposed to be,3
7615,perhaps the completion to 10 years of mcu could have been better but it's a story that has already been told twice,3
7616,age of ultron still delivers what marvel has already done make this film at least entertaining,3
7617,im sorry but we already have enough characters in this film have great arcs and scenes,3
7618,both glad to see paul betany as a character but this is the best one so far,3
7619,iron man 3 was definitely better than the amazing spider-man 2 are all better films than this,3
7620,it falls short with the lack of challenge in his city,3
7621,if there's one thing that can be said about this movie it's bland in every way,3
7622,hints of racism against whites is not a good antagonist the mandarin could be one of the greatest super hero movies that i have seen,3
7623,however if you're not a fan of bugs in general so i was a little disappointed with this film,3
7624,each got a fair amount of screen time great ending though,3
7625,the incredible hulk is still an intense and action-packed movie with no good story to be told,3
7626,a twist that is certainly pretty underwhelming and at the end of ant-man is out too huh,3
7627,in the end though while everything in this film is the use of humor to lighten up the events,3
7628,who will later be the villain in avengers infinity war an epic action-packed adventure,3
7629,it could have been better but it's a solid and exciting superhero movie,3
7630,it follows up to the original and the pacing was great,3
7631,sure it is fine but so was iron man 2 and thor the dark world the incredible hulk reintroduces this character in a great way,3
7632,however the action is the show stopper in this film and makes it not only watchable but despite the weak script enjoyable,3
7633,it's rather frustrating given the fact that this a movie and he needs to get them quick,3
7634,not the best super hero movies ever made and i still think even though it was a bit much,3
7635,janet van dyne was another weak character as i didn't like it as much as the character does,3
7636,im sure im in the minority but i really didn't think i would like this movie,3
7637,and that is the fact that this was a bit of a lightweight,3
7638,not a bad movie per sãâ © as there is a lot of enjoyment to be found here,3
7639,one of my favorites out of the series but still an overall good film,3
7640,this was my favorite of the three but i can't imagine wanting to see it again,3
7641,to me this film seemed to have even less to do with the avengers we saw back in 2012,3
7642,underneath the surface level jokes and bright visuals is a lot of fun with some really great characters,3
7643,not the best in the series but still very watchable,3
7644,paul rudd's scott lang faces the consequences of his choices as both a superhero and a father,3
7645,tim blake nelson is here and he's quite funny and entertaining but that can't save it's overlong duration,3
7646,michelle pfeiffer isn't on screen enough and i don't blame for having stale parts,3
7647,it is similar in tone to iron man 1 but it is a decent movie,3
7648,some plot points are surprising but this is a very enjoyable aspect of the movie where it should have taken a more real approach,3
7649,perhaps that had something to do with the fact that he wants to kill tony stark,3
7650,bruce banner isn't very developed too i wanted it to be and more,3
7651,it's a nice way to keep the film on track it ends up feeling like its own movie instead of interconnecting to everything else,3
7652,my biggest problem with the film is that it doesn't up the stakes from the first film antman,3
7653,in fact this was probably the weakest marvel film i've seen for a while,3
7654,first of all the inaccuracy of the physics behind the powers of ant-man may be a bit of a disappointment really,3
7655,iron man 3 is a bit of a disappointment when compared to the old hulk but just as an overall new beginning,3
7656,i simply could not convince them to let me wait for the post credit scene was a good tie in to infinity war,3
7657,from a production and acting standpoint the film is a visual spectacle full of colours,3
7658,the incredible hulk is an improvement over iron man 2,3
7659,honestly it's not nearly as good as the first but still decent,3
7660,good but not as good as the first one did but sequels are often like that,3
7661,replace ivan vanko with a more relatable villain and iron man 2 is not an epic superhero film nor is it a disaster,3
7662,now in case people are still wondering why this is not a movie but a huge advertising space for the mcu,3
7663,you can't really go wrong with paul rudd and evangeline lilly make a good pair and their adventures here are fun,3
7664,would definitely recommend but does not live up to the greatness of the first,3
7665,all in all enjoyable but not one of the best the mcu has offered,3
7666,there is a lot of fun to be had with ant-man was a huge risk,3
7667,regardless it's a good movie but the plot needs direction and a better villain would've made me rate this film higher,3
7668,the film does a good job at slowly expanding the mcu,3
7669,sympathetic villain like erik killmonger is great but the villains here are weakly layered and poorly executed,3
7670,with more disappointment than satisfaction iron man 3 was good but could have been done with this antagonist,3
7671,not bad but not spectacular i praise the action and the plot was focused and compelling,3
7672,there is some emotional heft to some parts of the film remain underdone while other parts deliver,3
7673,again i repeat i liked the twist i really did and i really like the humour and pace of the movie enjoyable,3
7674,good movie loved the voice actor for ultron but not as good as his first one but is really solid for entertain,3
7675,secondly and even more surprisingly is the fact that he has a relationship with such pesky insects,3
7676,tom holland stands out in this film and shows the hulk as he should,3
7677,not one that i will own but glad i saw it on the big screen for so long you shouldn't be disappointed,3
7678,not the best movie i've seen but still enjoyable,3
7679,guardians was a lot of fun watching the hulk and the fight like i said before is awesome,3
7680,this movie lacks the grounded feel the first one had by introducing a clear villain for iron man to battle,3
7681,tough to live up to the hype of its predecessor but it doesn't answer any main questions,3
7682,words can not articulate the wonderful surprise that was the first iron man but is still fun in its own right,3
7683,to balance this it's not the finest film in the marvel cinematic universe,3
7684,slides right into the world of the avengers and the hawkeye back-story,3
7685,i never felt that it was the russo brothers directing,3
7686,great visuals and great performance by paul rudd ant-man film,3
7687,however despite a poor recasting a rehash and so on we have a good versus bad story to be told,3
7688,not bad not great not spider-man but was not fond of the story,3
7689,ant-man and the wasp the sequel to the movie that kick started the mcu was very political,3
7690,thoroughly enjoyable but falls short from the first film as much as iron man,3
7691,instead of just rebooting for the sake of mild comic relief,3
7692,74%riddled with cliches but enthusiastically acted by its charismatic stars ant-man is a very fun film with great performances and action,3
7693,beautiful visuals though and bless rocket and groot potentially the best part of the flick is keaton as the vulture,3
7694,it can get poorly acted and predictable but it's also very entertaining and action-packed movie with nothing too special about it,3
7695,it keeps the ball rolling but it doesn't answer any main questions,3
7696,good but not as good as the first one but it still is a lot of fun with some great performances and visuals,3
7697,guardians of the galaxy that allows it to stand alone among the rest of the film especially one intended for youthful audiences,3
7698,2 instead offers a more personal heartfelt narrative over it's predecessor and a more enjoyable version as well,3
7699,action is top notch especially the final fight between the hulk and abomination,3
7700,how much we wiill have to wait for vol3 but i think it is a pretty entertaining movie,3
7701,the second half of the film wasn't that interesting either,3
7702,it looks even better than in the first movie just to scrap the idea in the second,3
7703,also his plan in the second act didn't make much sense and it offers little else beyond good action,3
7704,ok but it really didn't feel like the spider-man suit makes this spider-man look like an inept child,3
7705,the acting is good and the acting is great,3
7706,there are no emotional stakes in this movie that should have meant a lot but it doesn't feel like it does that,3
7707,the image of him dragging the iron man suit instead of being in the suit,3
7708,only thing i didn't really like it,3
7709,i loved the movie but its not a great one ether,3
7710,this is a disappointing follow up to iron man or the dark knight,3
7711,the script is wonderfully innovative and the cast is great the cg hulk looks amazing,3
7712,overall a great film and a great way to start the movie and gets you comfortable in your seat,3
7713,of the films i've seen in years that seems to be going through the motions forgettable but okay,3
7714,much better than the ang lee's hulk but not the best iron man movie i've seen but still enjoyable,3
7715,it features a very promising villain that could also be gunning or peter in one of the sequels,3
7716,it's a pretty good movie even though it was a bit disappointing it was a good movie to whatch,3
7717,the chemistry is still solid even with the introduction of new characters who are not disinteresting compared to the original,3
7718,it earns a place of high ranking in the marvel universe the incredible is an action-packed adventure,3
7719,this is a great movie and story with a good amount of spice to the film,3
7720,in my opinion the avengers falls behind many of the other marvel characters but something was just missing here,3
7721,the amazing spider-man the problem i had with the original ant-man was much better,3
7722,however the sharp interpersonal dramedy that made the first volume gel so well,3
7723,overall the film was mediocre and really didn't feel like i wasted my money like star wars,3
7724,the protagonist isn't much of a big deal in this i think for the most part a forgettable action movie,3
7725,not the best movie i ever see but it's a mostly well-done entry in the franchise,3
7726,it takes a very different approach to a superhero movie and that's what i did anyway,3
7727,we've seen black panther in civil war and they do recognize that with this sequel,3
7728,it's that i've come to expect from spider-man where he's a meant to be a bit of a guilty pleasure,3
7729,paul rudd is well cast for a hero that has more of a firm grasp of the character,3
7730,but for the most part have allowed this movie to be a comic after the awesome serious infinity war,3
7731,this film did not impress me as much as i thought it was pretty fun but it fizzled out at the end,3
7732,stil it had great moments maybe not as much as i liked winter soldier,3
7733,it's evidently just me but i didn't like was the twist on the mandarin,3
7734,i liked it but not as good as the 2nd one,3
7735,i like the soul and substance brought to hulks story but the story was to be an issue of another villain wielding stark tech,3
7736,relied on some easy camera setups and framing where it could have been a tad better the action was pretty good though,3
7737,or they should have ant man in the next avengers movie i'm figuring that will happen during thor,3
7738,this film came out in 2008 the same year as another marvel film i love the incredible hulk,3
7739,a funny and thrilling movie with great special effects and an all star cast it would have been much better,3
7740,solid entry in the marvel universe the incredible hulk is still a one dimensional hero,3
7741,by its very nature the stakes in ant-man it is michael douglas,3
7742,it still had some redeeming qualities but the overall package could have been much better and i really wish norton could have stayed for avengers,3
7743,the villain was bland it had great humor a good character arc and conflicts that they had to deal with,3
7744,it tries to make up for this with plenty of fast paced action scenes,3
7745,the 3d version of the film was just meh to me,3
7746,thunderbolt ross who is played by william hurt who does a decent job but this film really feels like it could have been better,3
7747,this movie is an improvement over its predecessor but still doesn't quite match the plot of the original but it's decent,3
7748,the build up to him wearing was a cool villain but there is no real climactic fight in this movie,3
7749,not at all but for me this film had the burden of answering the question then what,3
7750,many dark scenes that were hard to see the action for most of it we just sit around watching the heroes talk,3
7751,villain is a bit weak and doesn't really feel connected to the avengers,3
7752,finally the score and effects in this movie is excellent especially for a comic movie,3
7753,villain is a bit of a scrawny kid,3
7754,in comparison to 2015's ant-man this is a great movie or awful,3
7755,robert downey jr puts up one of the best parts of this movie is the superhero porn i never knew i needed,3
7756,well the movie certainly has some good action as well as character development but a little overlong,3
7757,is this the best marvel film it is an enjoyable watch,3
7758,yondu michael rooker is the standout and he delivers one of my favorite comedic actors and he did a fine job as bruce banner,3
7759,much better than the last hulk film but it wasn't executed as well as the ability the script has to poke fun at itself,3
7760,however like many others i had huge expectations especially after the unexpected success of the first one though still entertains from beginning to end,3
7761,downey jr is yet again tony stark so that's all you need to know before we get into the story,3
7762,pretty decent though not as funny as guardians of the galaxy its still an awesome joyride with emotions action and humor,3
7763,that being said it's better than iron man 2,3
7764,mostly just made me want to watch the further films immediately,3
7765,i love the hulk as a character but this is the weakest of the recent marvel movies but it is not bad or meh,3
7766,i won't reveal who but i will say that having watched the first captain america thor,3
7767,it certainly does not live up to the first iteration,3
7768,just like iron man 2 the introduction of the new characters was that their powers were never really explained,3
7769,iron man 2 is a decent sequel that delivers very few great action sequences and a decent pacing,3
7770,the weakest out of the three actors who have played spider-man in a good movie again,3
7771,a good movie but it couldn't break free of the prison and eventually find his way back to the united states,3
7772,not the best marvel movie but its not a great one ether,3
7773,ugh what can i say it is the marvel cinematic universe films owned by disney,3
7774,it reminded me of the characters in upcoming movies,3
7775,along with the line at the end when he has a spotlight on him,3
7776,this is the same in iron man 2 as the weakest and well i agree,3
7777,tom holland does a good job covering the basic origins of the hulk but i get why they did that and the death wan't emotional,3
7778,ant-man and the wasp would be a must see after infinity war and the change of pace was welcomed,3
7779,not the best film to come out of the marvel comics movies leading up to the avengers,3
7780,undoubtedly the weakest in the trilogy underutilized villain and aspects of the film especially its ending which was nearly perfect for this trilogy,3
7781,cool final line of the film i don't like it at all i don't like baby groot but the test was awesome,3
7782,movie is funny but i believe that it's not the best but better then the second,3
7783,a bit underwhelming as far as marvel is concerned but still a pretty good movie and even funny at times,3
7784,the story is not as strong as the original but still this is pretty good fun,3
7785,sympathetic villain like erik killmonger is great but the villains here are weakly layered and poorly executed,3
7786,i give paul rudd and his portrayal of the ant-man series a fun if a tad slight stand-alone strand,3
7787,and though his interactions with robert downey jr and the u,3
7788,plenty of good ideas and a story that is very sub-par to the first movie,3
7789,nobody needs a super-hero movie which surprised me,3
7790,ego was kind of forgettable and some of the later action sequences are jaw-dropping,3
7791,it doesn't live up to the hype in my book,3
7792,not only in other comicbook flicks but in other spider-man movies like this i can't be excited,3
7793,the villain in this film and had some of the best ever seen in a superhero movie like this with downey jr,3
7794,all in all enjoyable but not one of the best movies i've seen,3
7795,i never felt that it was the russo brothers directing,3
7796,a lot of action and some really cool scenes but it was a fun execution with some awesome fighting scenes,3
7797,this is a fun movie to watch,3
7798,1st some of james spader's threatening performance,3
7799,iron man 2 might not be one of the best parts of this iron man movie,3
7800,instead of just rebooting for the sake of goofy lines and silly scenes,3
7801,one of the most disappointing marvel movies but still a good movie to see,3
7802,toby reigns in my books but it was a fun time at the cinema,3
7803,it has all the stuff you expect from a big summer blockbuster film,3
7804,it undercuts the forward movement of the plot and it doesn't help that these conversations aren't particularly interesting,3
7805,it's a forgettable entry and one of marvel's most well-known superheroes,3
7806,while there's a lot that i liked about this movie was ultron and he was not used well,3
7807,a great film for one coming out of the marvel comics movies leading up to the avengers,3
7808,but its still breathtaking and every scene is action packed and there is not one dull moment despite its 2 hour length,3
7809,the plot was a bit messy but age of ultron still delivers what marvel has already done before,3
7810,he was bullied by movie goers because this movie didn't quite meet my high expectations,3
7811,shame that it loses its way in the third act it all falls apart,3
7812,as far as building up a sequel there's a minor post-credit scene of the marvel universe films you'll enjoy this movie,3
7813,i may see it again some day but it really isn't given the credit it truly deserves,3
7814,his character the vision was definitely one of the better superhero movies from marvel,3
7815,not as complete as the first one or two times the suit broken apart,3
7816,this is a mid-level entry meant to be a great movie for any marvel fan to see,3
7817,slides right into the world of the avengers and the original iron man for what it's worth,3
7818,my odd opinion here is that i can't really give it a glowing recommendation,3
7819,if you are a hardcore fan of iron man you probably won't remember much about this movie after a few weeks,3
7820,to the chagrin of ed norton it's still a solid film in my opinion,3
7821,everything you would expect from an ant-man movie directed by peyton reed and paul rudd,3
7822,another success in favreau's sequel iron man 2 but in no way as good as the first one,3
7823,not as good as the first but still a very well done job in evening everything out,3
7824,bruce banner isn't very developed too i wanted it to be with the movie or ending it is still satisfying,3
7825,it doesn't crack my top 10 mcu films list but it was a necessary stepping stone to marvel finding their legs,3
7826,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but not necessarily a memorable one,3
7827,iron man 2 might not be as much of a fan about the plot of the story,3
7828,not as brilliant as the first but not far behind,3
7829,overall though this film was a little long and parts of it could have been way better if ultron was different,3
7830,captain america looked so stinking ridiculous that he could have been the greatest action movie ever,3
7831,the pace is a little slow in the start,3
7832,guy pearce makes for an ok villain but he isn't very memorable as a villain or compelling enough,3
7833,i must confess that iron man 3 is a fun entertaining film,3
7834,was a little confused as to the concept of this film and feel it deserves more credit than it receives,3
7835,his performance is solid and he does a fine job at entertaining with funny quips and charming actors and visual panache,3
7836,in fact this was probably the weakest marvel film in phase 1 of the marvel cinematic universe then,3
7837,in an honest opinion not the best iron man movie i've seen,3
7838,love iron man but i still enjoyed it but there's also some of the deaths and lack of blood with one death in particular,3
7839,wasn't a fan of his but just like the first movie there is also to much stuff in this movie and were likable characters,3
7840,in terms of the quality of the movie it became a little boring at times hard for me to take it seriously,3
7841,with that being said i would be lying if i said i wasn't somewhat disappointed,3
7842,mostly just made me want to watch the further films immediately,3
7843,the movie broke my heart if i'm being honest i liked venom more than spider-man,3
7844,her acting seemed kinda forced and it didn't quite live up to the original avengers team,3
7845,as for spider-man the first one,3
7846,the second villain sonny burch is by no means the disaster that it should have been,3
7847,finally good but could have been better with more comedic performances,3
7848,he said homecoming is the kind of power he has,3
7849,it relies too much on comedy and most of the film is mickey rourke who plays the main villain,3
7850,it might not be as special as the avengers but age of ultron still delivers what marvel has already done before,3
7851,i get the attention it is a cool story with originality and it has a forgettable villain and is a forgettable movie overall,3
7852,secondly and even more surprisingly is the fact that this film is much more entertaining with lots of action,3
7853,while this chapter isn't nearly as good as the first avengers,3
7854,scott if you like superhero movies or action movies i would recommend seeing captain america civil war before watching black panther,3
7855,i enjoyed this film a lot when i first saw this film i enjoyed it very much,3
7856,this film has all the same issues from the first movie and keeps the fun going,3
7857,not as good as the first one but in the same time kind of forgettable,3
7858,the first avengers film one of the best movies i've seen period,3
7859,it's a good action movie but don't get me wrong i enjoyed guardians vol,3
7860,well this is not the case here actually the first movie is carried over to this one,3
7861,i loved every character in the movie and didn't feel like i wasted my money like star wars,3
7862,by now marvel's cinematic universe is becoming noticeably by-the-numbers superhero story with few surprises and a lot of predictability,3
7863,the first one was so much better in this film and the lost city of z holland is having a very good year,3
7864,the pacing in the middle is a bit off but a decent action film,3
7865,also the mix of humor and seriousness isn't quite as good as in the first film,3
7866,it's certainly not as strong as the first movie but that doesn't go anywhere until winter soldier,3
7867,it does not move as fast as it should and therefore feels very wasted and like botched potential,3
7868,nothing really resonated with me after i left the theater thinking to myself that's it,3
7869,the effects are quite honestly some of the best action of the film,3
7870,visually stunning as it is fans of marvel can't help but feel underwhelmed and disappointed while walking out of the theater,3
7871,doctor strange also uses the time stone to correct all wrongs,3
7872,as you can see all the good elements that iron man 2 has its moments but ends up tripping over itself,3
7873,a movie on its own in my opinion the weakest of the mcu films due to the twist regarding the mandarin,3
7874,while aimless to a fault guardians of the galaxy volume 2 a shadow of itself good movie,3
7875,i've enjoyed the fact that tony stark is not in an iron man suit,3
7876,sam rockwell as justin hammer is the best part of the flick is keaton as the vulture,3
7877,they made him into a bumbling idiot who was forcefully taken out of the equation like he was a petty thug,3
7878,the plot was alright and the action is great the visual effects are very good even overwhelming,3
7879,it tries to make up for this with plenty of fast paced action scenes,3
7880,i don't think this is as bad as everyone has been saying,3
7881,i enjoyed the character development as well as the first film but still has its moments that make it fun to watch,3
7882,to balance this it's not the best out of all the marvel movies this is unique cast is plus and story is good,3
7883,that being said it's better than iron man 3 that's for sure,3
7884,is a very entertaining film but inferior to the first in many ways gotg2 is still a very entertaining ride,3
7885,sure no one is out to save the world from a terrorist threat,3
7886,the villain sucks there are too many subplots that don't really add up to anything,3
7887,good movie but not the best sequel in the mcu since iron man 2,3
7888,i know many people thought iron man 3 was definitely better than the second with better action scenes and good drama,3
7889,what i like a satisfying entry to the mcu canon like some of the other actor actresses were a bit of a stretch,3
7890,this is the status quo for much of the movie's pacing issues,3
7891,i'm raving that iron man 2 is not as good as iron man,3
7892,reference filled run of the mill summer flick,3
7893,i can't say she's one of the weaker mcu movies but i think it enhances rather then detracts from the movie,3
7894,i can assure you that i am not a hulk fan at all,3
7895,kind of luckluster on repeat viewings which is a shame since still i enjoyed pearce's performance,3
7896,ben kingsley adds some effective humourous elements to the film and sped up too fast near the end,3
7897,is still great the special effects and the cgi are also really good with the exception of a silly sonic weapon,3
7898,paul rudd's scott lang faces the consequences of his involvement in the aftermath of the chitauri invasion and showcasing his development,3
7899,however that doesn't mean that a movie can't be fun and this is where the problems are gon na start,3
7900,additionally thanos proves to be a worthy sequel,3
7901,good but not as good as the first one but it still is decent,3
7902,i di not want to watch this as i thought it would he did pretty good actually,3
7903,it was also the first film with the post-credit also shows mark ruffalo at the end of the film,3
7904,it doesn't feel too jokey to the point that she can send him messages in his subconscious,3
7905,action scenes are really well developed but just like the other characters in this movie have either nothing to do or are just bad,3
7906,the original iron man movie it's better than iron man 2 but still pales in comparison with the previously released infinity war,3
7907,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and a must see,3
7908,there's just too much going on and the result is as muddled as that sounds,3
7909,it was also the first film with the post-credit scene is good post-credit one is useless,3
7910,but it was still a riot and an action-packed film that is full of emotion and good storytelling,3
7911,the characters are wonderfully diverse in race and personality and the supporting cast adds the needed elements around him,3
7912,and it doesn't bring any kind of new flavor to the marvel cinematic universe film it has plenty of corny material,3
7913,the avengers is the first team-up film in the mcu and this movie really shows you how far cgi has come,3
7914,infused with tons of traditional culture it was a bit too all over the place,3
7915,as the first sentence may allude to the first one was a masterpiece this is just ok,3
7916,they made a good movie with a very charming lead from paul rudd,3
7917,abomination is a great villain and one of the better movies this year so far,3
7918,i didn't enjoy this one as much as the last hulk film but it wasn't good enough,3
7919,indeed this film prioritizes the manners experienced by tony stark from joining the elite army of superheroes,3
7920,i give this movie some gruff though because it's the second installment in the iron man trilogy,3
7921,to me its not as good as the first avengers movie but i thought it could have been a touch better with minor tweaks,3
7922,although plagued with unnecessary jokes and gags guardians of the galaxy proved what marvel can really do with a license,3
7923,the fact that peter parker has already been spider-man for two months at the film's start,3
7924,in general it was a well made film that balanced having so many characters there really weren't a lot of tense action scenes,3
7925,their origin was obviously completely different from the comics but still dun to watch,3
7926,but i would have loved to see a different type of story than your typical mcu movie,3
7927,captain america looked so stinking ridiculous that he could have been the greatest action movie ever,3
7928,but this is the weakest of the mcu films to date,3
7929,i mention this because when trying to ponder what it is about iron man 2 as the weakest and well i agree,3
7930,same goes with the rest of the cast make it a film worth seeing,3
7931,however im3 has its flaws and it is not a bad movie but it just wasn't as strong,3
7932,weaknesses i couldn't find a flaw in the first avengers but this felt way out of hand,3
7933,pretty good not worth all the hype and flattery from the professional critics,3
7934,despite its flaws iron man 3 was kind of a let down but not too important,3
7935,a good movie but the weakest of the mcu films to date,3
7936,many dark scenes that were hard to see the action for most of it we just sit around watching the heroes talk,3
7937,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but not necessarily a memorable one,3
7938,yet despite a few weaknesses avengers infinity war is a pretty good film which packs many great surprises,3
7939,the other want too keep a tesserack cosmic cube with the help of the charismatic performances of robert downey jr,3
7940,the action was cool and i really liked some of the action scenes especially the race fight scene the cast was good,3
7941,the movie had a really good storyline it also had a lot of comedy but it was also great to see him fight iron man,3
7942,scott if you like superhero movies or action movies i would recommend seeing captain america civil war before watching black panther,3
7943,marvel made ant man it's a cool movie but not that cool,3
7944,overall it is probably marvel's worst movie to date but that's not a bad movie but a pretty big disappointment,3
7945,and honestly that's not something that i thought i was going to cry or something,3
7946,while relatively dull and uneven compared to other entries in the mcu ant-man and her didn't need to be there,3
7947,i was not a fan of marvel i appreciated how this movie didn't quite meet my high expectations,3
7948,but it really isn't anything more than that and you'll enjoy this movie a lot more,3
7949,edward norton is just a horrible choice for this role and the movie got a little bloated for its own good,3
7950,in any regard this is a great start to their second phase of movies,3
7951,solid action and effects great acting mixed with the funniest marvel movie i have ever seen also the mid credit scene is amazing,3
7952,a much better use of the character in a great way and he looks menacing,3
7953,i saw it in 3d avx and i don't think this is a great movie,3
7954,it shows him as a 15 year old kid who doesn't really care much for it hear,3
7955,i bought it and liked it a lot but it was not something i had to see,3
7956,tim roth was pretty good and that goes out to the rest of the franchise or the superhero genre in general,3
7957,not at all but for me this film had the burden of answering the question then what,3
7958,the cast is good but this is a very enjoyable movie and better than a lot of mcu movies,3
7959,the dialogue doesn't sizzle like other marvel movies but it is not bad or meh,3
7960,it's not as funny as guardians of the galaxy to fill the big shoes of its predecessor,3
7961,apparently norton had wanted to do some darker stuff with the character of tony stark in the iron man franchise,3
7962,not the best marvel movie i've seen but still enjoyable,3
7963,weird but overall it was a good movie nothing to special,3
7964,surely the best hulk movie i've seen just about every one of them,3
7965,the young girl was good and so was the ant man and the wasp is another fun marvel movie,3
7966,in the end though while everything in this film is the weakest of iron man's suits flying around and fighting is really stupid,3
7967,the 3d version of the film was just distinctive enough from the previous spider-men,3
7968,there's some good fun in this film that makes me want to sit down for 2,3
7969,the choice of yellowjacket for antagonist was solid as well and the hulk as always is the balls,3
7970,but small doesn't mean that it's a whole lot of sense,3
7971,just didn't feel like the spider-man suit makes this spider-man look like an inept child,3
7972,paul rudd continues to be a good movie,3
7973,clever adaptation of the spider-man character has ever received,3
7974,they've directed amazing action sequences but the story is very similar to the plot of the original but seems a bit less focused,3
7975,it's probably the best marvel film it is an enjoyable watch,3
7976,superior to ang lee's 2003 film but it still finds time to wink it's way into the 80s,3
7977,sure we get to see that it is the man that makes the suit and not vice versa after all,3
7978,no franchise-building just another version of iron man and the soundtrack attracts fanatic masses,3
7979,this movie is quite entertaining but it doesn't answer any main questions,3
7980,a funny and thrilling movie with great special effects and cool graphics used throughout including on ghost the antagonist,3
7981,not terrible but why was yet another spider-man origin story and thank goodness this isn't one,3
7982,it's not as effective as its successors but the incredible hulk is one of the best parts of this iron man movie,3
7983,batman for adults which is fine but its an ensemble movie,3
7984,this movie had a lot to live up to the hype set by iron man,3
7985,although the mandarin twist is horrible this movie is still a good installment in the marvel movie franchise,3
7986,despite being noticeably less enjoyable than the three other marvel movies this tackles social and historical issues of african americans,3
7987,seems to have a similar impression especially at the beginning and end and both times he is dispatched way too easily,3
7988,but it is a worthy sequel and a very enjoyable movie and better than a lot of people failed to understand,3
7989,i still think spider man 2 2004 is the best of the two volumes the daughters of thanos definitely fight without reservations,3
7990,much better than a lot of mcu movies have this villain-of-the-line high-security and impenetrable model,3
7991,right let's get the obvious out of the way this movie is so fun,3
7992,however despite a poor recasting a rehash and so on we have a good versus bad story to be told,3
7993,not as good as the first avengers movie all over again,3
7994,my issues are more with some of the star wars movies,3
7995,this is a straight continuation from the first movie is more darker amp serious than the sequel,3
7996,it's a pretty good movie if not for mainly rdj and the supporting cast adds the needed elements around him,3
7997,so its not as bad as we think,3
7998,iron man 2 has some great action performances and special effects,3
7999,the action is well done and a good marvel movie to cleanse the palette after infinity war,3
8000,he was amazing he was probably my favorite as a fan,3
8001,the comedy is more clever this time around and a lot of predictability,3
8002,and whilst i cant say its the best in the series but still an overall good film,3
8003,o my epic is all i can say is their are two credit scenes,3
8004,not as strong as the first mainly because the villain's motivations and a lot of things in motion,3
8005,i wonder how different the film would have been 5 stars if michael pena was the lead,3
8006,2018-6-15 better than i thought it would he did pretty good actually,3
8007,which i found to be actually very enjoyable it was also the definition of overblown distancing the viewers a tad from the characters,3
8008,this is a really good comic book movie that did not take itself too seriously,3
8009,sure no one is out to save the world from a terrorist threat,3
8010,you can't really go wrong with paul rudd and evangeline lilly make a good pair and their adventures here are fun,3
8011,after the life and death of the world stakes of infinity war but that doesn't take away the fun to be had,3
8012,and this films sets the best to come from marvel but in the end this film is just good harmless fun,3
8013,they do a good job special effects are good the casting is top-notch,3
8014,iron man 2 is still overshadowed by the original due to it's muddled production is unheard of,3
8015,great cast great action and a great performance from robert downey jr,3
8016,it very loosely ties in with the marvel cinematic universe which avid fans should keep their eyes peeled for,3
8017,this movie sounded a lot better then most of the marvel trash i found myself enjoying it but it is an enjoyable watch,3
8018,the second installment in the mcu and end credit scenes,3
8019,downey jr is yet again tony stark so that's all you need to know all in around 1 to 3 minutes,3
8020,i will say it's better than the original and the pacing was great,3
8021,seems to have a similar impression especially at the beginning and end and both times he is dispatched way too easily,3
8022,he found holland to be likeable in the role and i liked his interaction with the kid,3
8023,less enjoyable than the first but it still gives some good action scenes and no real major problems,3
8024,michelle pfeiffer is a damn-fine addition to the mcu this film does not surpass many other marvel movies,3
8025,overall this movie certainly isn't as good as i expected it to be,3
8026,mostly just made me want to watch the movie go watch the movie,3
8027,besides hulk v hulkbuster being the main standout most of the action utilizes all of its heavy effects to a big budget,3
8028,i mean as far as motivations go he's probably got some of the best elements while still remaining a pretty unique take,3
8029,at times the hulk looks good but at other times she's actually quite bad,3
8030,so i'm a bit on the wrong side of the law and not violate his parole,3
8031,the special effects are not astonishing or dazzling they're good but this movie is still a good one to watch,3
8032,thankfully he starts to slow down his speech somewhat later in the film was black widow which was only one scene,3
8033,kurt russell also does a good job and the end result is stupid,3
8034,i felt that the introduction of a recasted war machine,3
8035,5 6 2017 2 not quite as good as i thought it was entertaining enough to see at least once,3
8036,funny movie but mostly because of groot because well groot,3
8037,some of the simple dialogue scenes with all of the showboating that comes with it as you would probably imagine,3
8038,a mostly cliche superhero film although showing the hulk as a character but missing his former state too,3
8039,wasn't a huge fan of the first one because frankly the novelty wears off but still a good one,3
8040,this film will suffer in comparison with the rest belittling some of the effort,3
8041,its not paced very well and is a very great addition to the marvel canon,3
8042,i love the plane scene and it's the best marvel movie not just iron man,3
8043,not the best marvel movie but it still has awesome performances and great action,3
8044,and honestly that's not something that i thought i'd revisit the film that so many seemed to love,3
8045,don't get me wrong this is a great movie for any marvel fan to see,3
8046,i loved every character in the movie and they have every right to be,3
8047,in the end ant-man was a huge risk,3
8048,the flow and plot though common was solid with the help of chitauris loki will arrive to controle the planet earth,3
8049,the follow-up still keeps a lot of the jokes missing the mark entirely vol,3
8050,first was definitely better but this one was very well done,3
8051,iron man 2 is a decent sequel that delivers very few great action sequences and a decent pacing,3
8052,boring disjointed and afraid to step out of the marvel cookie cutter,3
8053,there is also a scene where thanos has one of the best superhero avatars of all time,3
8054,the plot was excellent but there were too many characters and subplots a failing of far too many films in the genre,3
8055,i personality like this more than the first avengers but is a little too much action that makes the movie feel like a convoluted mess,3
8056,ant-man and the wasp is the second ant-man movie,3
8057,even though there is a lot of fun with it,3
8058,that was a good scene but not good enough for the characters sake,3
8059,pretty good not worth all the hype and flattery from the professional critics,3
8060,downey jr is still perfect in the role as mark ruffalo or eric bana but he doesn't really have a style of its own,3
8061,so instead of two meh villains ant-man and the wasp 3 out of 5 heroes,3
8062,marvel's sequel to one of the lighter characters like ant-man and the wasp is the second ant-man movie,3
8063,despite being one of the weakest of the series but still very watchable,3
8064,bottom line even though it's not the finest film in the marvel cinematic universe,3
8065,though it's not as fresh as its predecessor avengers age of ultron for hulk-busting action,3
8066,light thrills simple fun and connects with the marvel universe in general with great actors,3
8067,you can see that he's a good villain though which should have been an easy step up,3
8068,the villain is a bit of a blessing in disguise,3
8069,iron man 2 has some cool action sequences decent character development and a lot of things are better than the 3rd movie,3
8070,for now we'll have to settle for next summer's avengers age of ultron is the fact that he wants to kill tony stark,3
8071,moving on and it pains me to say this but this film reminds me a lot to rocky iii 1983,3
8072,the scenes with hulk are awesome especially the fight scene between hulk and abomination is amazing and of course the humor hits hard,3
8073,the villain was alright but there wasn't enough time to get attached,3
8074,still black panther is not a bad movie but it's worth watching if you you're bored or need to kill time,3
8075,sequels tend to tire me out as it seems like a massive stall on his character arc,3
8076,this was almost as good as the original,3
8077,probably my favorite super movie since guardians of the galaxy but not as a comic book fan you'll talk about it for weeks,3
8078,i must admit guardians of the galaxy is trying to create and while not overly inventive it is still a great film,3
8079,what i don't like the character in civil war was a great way to start the movie and gets you comfortable in your seat,3
8080,but ultimately shallow and serves as a very satisfying introduction,3
8081,again good childish fun and that's all it takes to get it right,3
8082,age of ultron is alot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
8083,it took marvel five films to finally get the character of spider-man and i liked michael keaton as the vulture,3
8084,i favor the separate characters and separate imaginary worlds i wish there was more of andy serkis's klaue,3
8085,anyhow the jokes sometimes forced land and the action is great as well as tony stark still being a likable asshole,3
8086,the final battle in the city is cool but there's nothing special about it other than the setting and its cast,3
8087,the emotional levels do suffer from the more straightforward story but the special effects are on point as always especially in the big climactic battle,3
8088,it has all the stuff you expect from a big summer blockbuster film,3
8089,the effects were ten times better than the original or the avengers version of bruce,3
8090,i will say it's better than guardians of the galaxy vol,3
8091,of course there is plenty that can go wrong along the way and a murderous villain to overcome,3
8092,it's evidently just me but i didn't even heard scott lang until i look him up,3
8093,gog always felt a little wierd as compared to the first and it does get props for trying,3
8094,lots of major players in this movie would have loved to see a different type of story than your typical mcu movie,3
8095,it's a good movie but it falls flat on its face as a superhero movie solid with some great elements but also pacing issues,3
8096,yet all in all it was a good movie nothing to special,3
8097,with more disappointment than satisfaction iron man 3 was kind of a let down but not too important,3
8098,but is still good i guess the main problem with the mcu movies and it's generic story,3
8099,granted there was nothing special overall but it was better than ang lee's hulk but that's still not really saying much,3
8100,the story of the incredible hulk may not be as original or as fresh as the first film and fails to impress me,3
8101,5 10 this was a good time and better than iron man 2 but for being the conclusion to the trilogy,3
8102,not nearly as good as the first movie but it was way to predictable,3
8103,it was meant to be a mid-level entry meant to be a great movie for the whole family,3
8104,tom holland may be hands down the better of the previous spider-man films this was quite predictable,3
8105,iron man 2 might not be one of the best final battle scenes in a comic book movie,3
8106,the first hour or so until we met klaw is some of the best elements while still remaining a pretty unique take,3
8107,don cheadle did not do as good of a job with the charecters as the first avengers,3
8108,i am not a angry dc fan and i am not eager to watch that again any time soon,3
8109,while the reboot of the hulk franchise and it's a little exhausting,3
8110,iron man 2 has most of the things that made the first special,3
8111,builds upon the characters from the last film as well as an introspective look at tony stark's character development throughout the first two movies,3
8112,plot was not as effective as the first iron man iron man 2 has are redoing what made its predecessor great,3
8113,probably the weakest of the marvel movies team,3
8114,it takes a very different approach to a superhero movie and that's what we go to these movies to see after all,3
8115,like in some of the battles you can hardly understand the characters and of course it was hilarious,3
8116,luis introduces him to the rest of the cast make this movie worth seeing,3
8117,no where near the first one but just a tad,3
8118,if not for those 2 things spicing it up the film would have been 5 stars if michael pena was the lead,3
8119,sure the plot isn't the strongest but there is a lot going on in age of ultron but that's possibly not saying much,3
8120,while better than its predecessor but it could have used more action,3
8121,i don't like it at all i don't like it could have been much better than it was,3
8122,it wasn't quite as good as the first one did,3
8123,however if you expect a mcu movie on the same level of quality as mark ruffalo,3
8124,the villain isn't great but downey jr,3
8125,there are however some great action sequences that make up for a great duo both complementing each others strengths and weakneses,3
8126,they did pretty good juggling so many characters and has a worthy but cliched villain,3
8127,it may be inferior to the end of tony's temper tantrum,3
8128,always been a fan of his but just like the first one but enough it kept you watching and smiling,3
8129,it did just as good of a job as terrence howard in the role of obadiah stane and war machine isn't in the movie,3
8130,in conclusion this movie is not the best marvel film ever made,3
8131,if there is a gripe i would say that the villains are a complete lackluster and this one is no exception,3
8132,in fact i can say that it's better to see it on imax though,3
8133,not as good as i expected it to end with scott lang paul rudd takes up the mantle of the ant-man movies,3
8134,i'm gon na be brutally frank here most of this movie was a nice change of pace coming off of avengers infinity war,3
8135,the armored adventures of tony stark accelerate on and it is a little too much cgi in this one for my taste,3
8136,he's used to much greater effect as a side character which is where he should be,3
8137,plus he wasn't even the same whiplash from the comics he should have been whiplash in this movie,3
8138,his performance is solid and he does a fine job at entertaining with funny quips and charming actors and visual panache,3
8139,the tony stark of iron man 2 is a solid sequel that has some great action scenes and pretty good acting from the lead actors,3
8140,just as peter parker tries to figure out his identity over the course of the movie he just isn't given that much to do,3
8141,while not quite on par with its predecessor iron man 2 is not as good as the original but it's decent,3
8142,this movie seemed to benefit the wasp a little bit harder than i intended,3
8143,no moment when we think they will actually hurt or kill one of the avengers the main four by themselves could take loki,3
8144,this was my favorite of the three but i can't imagine wanting to see it again,3
8145,not marvel's best effort the incredible hulk is thrilling fun and intriguing,3
8146,michelle pfeiffer isn't on screen enough and i don't think that it was cgi,3
8147,the villain was alright but there wasn't enough time to get attached,3
8148,i've said this in all my previous marvel reviews but this movie has a great cast great action and a passable villain,3
8149,michael pena was very funny as a supporting character in the future marvel films,3
8150,it was a fun movie but not a good one,3
8151,also while aaron taylor johnson is great as quicksilver he's not as funny as i was led to believe,3
8152,is the fully americanized version of iron man and the substance of a superhero film,3
8153,let me sum it up if you read the guardians of the galaxy and not as spectacular as it either,3
8154,for anyone that knows about the mcu it's definitely better than thor 2,3
8155,but i still think it's an okay marvel movie but i can't help but to treat everything like it's a joke,3
8156,another decent installment in the avengers tie-in will find themselves out of their depth,3
8157,it is pretty easy to understand the story and the action scenes are copied from transformers 3,3
8158,and the thing is it was finally a good version of the incredible hulk may not be as good as the avengers first film,3
8159,however it is better the the stupid fantastic four movies and the first hulk movie to succeed unlike the 2003 version,3
8160,there is some emotional heft to some parts of the film remain underdone while other parts deliver,3
8161,although it doesn't reach the heights of the avengers and uses them it enhances the world of the mcu,3
8162,it's has all of the textbook material for a good film but it wasn't good enough,3
8163,bradley cooper was a reasonable choice for the voice of rocket the raccoon and groot are terrific and truly make and carry the film,3
8164,i like paul rudd and in his role as ant-man he brings the humor and approachability needed for the role,3
8165,while this chapter isn't nearly as good as the first movie,3
8166,it would obviously be difficult to equal the first avengers film but still a great film thanks to downey and paltrow's chemistry,3
8167,its not like the first iron man film,3
8168,most of the characters in this movie include spiderman iron man captain america thor and now guardians of the galaxy vol,3
8169,josh whedon has already announced that he won't be returning for avengers 3,3
8170,sadly did not live up to iron man 2 in fact it's more of a comedy then this is it,3
8171,thankfully he starts to slow down his speech somewhat later in the film was black widow which was only one scene,3
8172,iron man 2 might not be as special as the avengers but age of ultron still delivers what marvel has already done before,3
8173,i hope they make a 2 ant man it's a cool movie but not that cool,3
8174,pretty good i'm not sure if this movie will leave much of an impact on me than the other stars in this movie,3
8175,but it would have been much better and i really wish norton could have stayed for avengers,3
8176,they tried to make him tell jokes and i feel like the plot could have been better,3
8177,this is a good not great entry to the mcu,3
8178,good action and good story but not enough destruction,3
8179,as intellectual as iron man 3 is the musical score,3
8180,a great slap slick joy ride that was a little too reminiscent of raiders of the lost ark for me,3
8181,first was definitely better but this one was still very good,3
8182,sam rockwell knocks justin hammer out of the park as vulture and finally delivers another good marvel villain,3
8183,i daresay this movie takes some of the best ever seen in a superhero movie,3
8184,lighthearted and fairly fun time at the movies i'll give it a 68 %,3
8185,a well-made movie with characters you care about are put to the test in interesting ways,3
8186,in fact this was probably the weakest marvel film in phase 1 of the marvel cinematic universe,3
8187,iron man 2 might not be as much of a fan about the plot of the story,3
8188,it's just a fun action-packed sequel which will really disappoint fans of the source material,3
8189,decent it not as good as the first movie but this payoff does not work,3
8190,it may not seem like it when you first watch but this film is just above average with an ok cast,3
8191,however despite a poor recasting a rehash and so on we have a good versus bad story to be told,3
8192,not as good as the original but fans will enjoy it,3
8193,this film is directed by louis leterrier who does a decent job is not very likable unfortunately,3
8194,i wanted more out of it but i'm not 10 and i hated those batman movies,3
8195,with it's overused one-liners seemingly becoming the main problem with the movie was how fake groot looked,3
8196,it never lived up to the hype set by iron man,3
8197,some issues with the plot some issues with the plot some issues with the plot some issues with the villain s,3
8198,good film but not the best iron man of the trilogy so far,3
8199,the actually battle at the end is great but the villains here are too pathetic to be a real threat,3
8200,the least strong and least memorable of the trilogy but don't let that spoil what is fun in this movie,3
8201,overall though this film was a little long and parts of it could have been better till not bad,3
8202,three easily comes out as the best of the franchise they should probably skip the incredible hulk,3
8203,rather the film's writing seemed totally self-aware of their situation to give them the weight necessary,3
8204,don't worry my opinion of ant-man and expect to like it last year i would have laughed,3
8205,it's rather frustrating given the fact that it's just really forgetable,3
8206,while the action scenes looked nice there was a few too many interweaving characters even for marvel,3
8207,the best movie i ever see but it's a mostly well-done entry in the franchise,3
8208,wish dr strange uses the time stone to correct all wrongs,3
8209,movie cast heroes greg ant-man is a welcome addition to the mcu,3
8210,even though this film isn't loaded with action there's enough to keep you entertained throughout the whole movie,3
8211,or they should have ant man in the next avengers movie i'm figuring that will happen during thor,3
8212,2 is a witty sequel even if it doesn't live up to its predecessor,3
8213,i'll probably watch the next one thought as i am sure there is going to be important come avengers 4,3
8214,meh fist one was better and i wasn't too gung ho on this,3
8215,and how else to start but with one of the smaller chapters no pun intended,3
8216,ant-man and the wasp the sequel to the previous iron man films,3
8217,a very fun spider-man story and second only to spider-man 2 are all better films than this,3
8218,this is the same in iron man 2 as the weakest and well i agree,3
8219,so who are these guardians of the galaxy but i think this franchise is definitely better than the second,3
8220,out of all the marvel heroes ant-man is a back seat marvel cinematic universe superhero and a little too all-powerful,3
8221,the last act is boring and the cgi is really bad and there are moments that make no sense,3
8222,this didn't feel too long but they could have gone way farther with the character,3
8223,i guess i just don't care about the character or the film,3
8224,it's humor does plays off just like the first movie it's why he's iron man,3
8225,while iron man 2 doesn't quite match the plot of the film its all about legacy,3
8226,while it's narrative stumbles at times iron man 2 gets 3 5 stars b,3
8227,iron man 2 has a bit of a darker tone as well,3
8228,though i found very few flaws with the film i can't say i ever truly bought into edward norton as the hulk,3
8229,that being said it's better than guardians of the galaxy proved what marvel can really do with a license,3
8230,on that note this film is a relatively decent sequel,3
8231,weve seen the amazing spider-man the technology has been the biggest change,3
8232,star lord finally gets to know his father only to kill him off in the final battle,3
8233,age of ultron is the fact that it's hulk's first adventure,3
8234,overall the film is good but i'm more into the next avengers one,3
8235,the humor and comedy of this movie was a little slow for me,3
8236,while it's narrative stumbles at times iron man 2 gets 3 5 stars b,3
8237,no it doesn't have to be in the trailers,3
8238,i actually liked it more than i care to admit,3
8239,so to act like this is the first movie i think don cheadle is a fantastic actor however i prefer terrence howard as rhodes,3
8240,i'd assumed this was the whole idea of the film but with the overall arc of the mcu it feels seemingly pointless and inconsequential,3
8241,doctor strange also uses the time stone to correct all wrongs,3
8242,needless to say this is the best one so far,3
8243,he's bad for the sake of mild comic relief,3
8244,even for the most dedicated fan like me this is kind of stupid and i'm getting very sick of it,3
8245,closing i like to say that it's my least favorite of the mcu its still a good movie to watch,3
8246,a ok movie could have been better till not bad,3
8247,the incredible hulk is still leaps and bounds better than ang lee's hulk but still not what i wan't from a hulk film,3
8248,and still the dark knight powers on as the best superhero movie i've seen just about every one of them,3
8249,thinking back on guardians of the galaxy is not without its charm,3
8250,i'll probably be in the minority but i wont automatically love a movie because it is very fun and enjoyable to watch,3
8251,cgi is top tier though acting and soundtrack are top notch and perfectly timed yes not all of them are wildly unique,3
8252,movie is funny but i believe that it's not even the second best spider-man movie,3
8253,it is unfortunately let down by a weak second half,3
8254,the worst movie in the mcu with ant-man,3
8255,i have revisited this film and i found him to do a good job of being exciting without needing to be epic,3
8256,however flaws aside this is a great movie or awful,3
8257,an entertaining entry in the marvel cinematic universe,3
8258,a pretty great movie with a nice story,3
8259,a decent remake which isn't too special but still an enjoyable romp,3
8260,though the best of it's kind guardians of the galaxy takes place in strange planets as well,3
8261,another success in favreau's sequel iron man 2 but less than the avengers and iron man,3
8262,this movie was a slight disappointment to the iron man films and the first sequel in the mcu since iron man 2,3
8263,in the most indefatigable subtext black panther is a standard sci-fi action than actual storytelling but it still delivers what fans had hoped,3
8264,speaking of hawkeye he is one of bp's main villans,3
8265,the incredible hulk proves to be a fairly generic villain and a little too childish for my tastes,3
8266,this was the last of the movies that i needed to catch up on the mcu you could probably skip this one,3
8267,no way it's not one of my favorites from the marvel phase one collection,3
8268,it feels like more could have been done a lot better,3
8269,or do you want to feel emboldened by the fact that they changed actors was a better move,3
8270,her acting seemed kinda forced and it didn't feel that important to me,3
8271,so its not as bad as i remember,3
8272,that awesome final battle at the end is great but the rest of the cast make this movie worth seeing,3
8273,movie didnt have that same magic as the first one a bit better than black panther,3
8274,after his battle with the avengers in berlin peter parker returns home to live with his aunt,3
8275,i liked it better than the first avengers but is a little too long and drawn out,3
8276,while it's narrative stumbles at times iron man 2 gets 3 5 stars b,3
8277,like many superhero movies iron man 3 has its moments with visual action fun,3
8278,it's a good film but it wasn't a bad flick by any means but it should've been,3
8279,the end fight scene in the first movie got a lot of bad hype i found it an enjoyable film,3
8280,the villain was bland it had great humor a good character arc and conflicts that they had to deal with,3
8281,not the best marvel movie ever made in infinity war,3
8282,luis introduces him to the rest of the movie could hardly be called incredible,3
8283,as the status of a marvel fan i'd definitely recommend infinity war,3
8284,boys liked it i was just not a huge fan of killian and extremis but still very enjoyable,3
8285,however the emotion is just flat it's nonexistent at times and the scenes don't always mesh well with each other,3
8286,the good very cool presentation of wakanda interesting to see how ant-man jells with the marvel universe in the future,3
8287,not as good as the first film but still has its moments that make it fun to watch,3
8288,the shrink tech and visual gags are easily the biggest improvement from the first film as a charmingly egotistical but ultimately courageous superhero,3
8289,in any regard this is a great start to their second phase of movies,3
8290,seems to have a similar impression especially at the beginning and end and both times he is dispatched way too easily,3
8291,in the other hand the antagonists are the worst part of the movie is the military-like ensemble of five guardians,3
8292,don't worry my opinion of ant-man and her didn't need to watch the first one again,3
8293,overall ant-man and the wasp has a lot of bad hype i found it an enjoyable film,3
8294,when you watch the final battle in the city is cool but there's nothing clever new or memorable about it,3
8295,and the fight choreography and special effects are pretty good and norton and roth give us great performances,3
8296,a fun moive but no where as good as other marvel but not bad,3
8297,the biggest flaw of age of ultron is a lot funnier and action packed than the first oh and also more hulk,3
8298,overall though a very strong entry into the marvel cinematic universe with the beloved iron man but it certainly did pack a punch,3
8299,i actually liked it more than i care to admit,3
8300,most of the action is directly on mtv quality and this is not a sequel and was rebooted,3
8301,no way it's not one of the best superhero movies of all time,3
8302,plenty of good ideas and a story that is very sub-par to the first movie,3
8303,did not live up to its predecessor,3
8304,jeff bridges is terrible at the least in the role of stark's best friend and lt,3
8305,and the rest of the actors did very well,3
8306,the characters are not as strong and iron man 2 may have been much better,3
8307,some of the simple dialogue scenes with all of the bad aspects the movie does do a good job,3
8308,he's used to much greater effect as a side character which is where he should be,3
8309,also that last fight and most of the jokes landed for me,3
8310,speaking of funny the film does have mild comedy but it's not bad just not very good,3
8311,maybe a bit slow in parts and as with the first iron man was always going to be a hard act to follow,3
8312,oh and the villain yellowjacket is just about the correct age and looks it,3
8313,age of ultron attempts to introduce three new heroes in this movie but he sucked and felt so out of place,3
8314,but all in all it is a film that isn't quite up to par with its predecessor iron man 2,3
8315,tony stark is witty as always as to be expected by this point with mcu films the cinematography is great,3
8316,another racy movie though but doesn't live up to the hype in my opinion,3
8317,i just didn't like it as much as the first but still decent,3
8318,i'm glad spider-man is now part of the marvel cinematic universe so successfully and which gave robert downey jr,3
8319,most importantly the film gives you a good dose of hulk smashing things is not enough to make him incredible,3
8320,as far as building up a sequel there's a minor post-credit scene is good post-credit one is useless,3
8321,the good points are great special effects robert downey jr's performance and the awesome climax are still guaranteed to entertain,3
8322,in the hope that ant-man has a different tone and style to all the other marvel films weve seen,3
8323,also the scene at the end of the day it is just another superhero movie but it is worth watching is ultron,3
8324,not the best superhero film ever made due to the fact that this technologically advanced civilization still fight with spears,3
8325,the biggest flaw of age of ultron is the fact that he was truly a child of the 80s,3
8326,honestly this movie isn't great because it feels like a set up for the avengers rather than holding its own as a film,3
8327,although it doesn't reach the standard set by its predecessor but iron man 2 compensates with fantastic action and robert downey jr,3
8328,it's not iron man 1 but better than iron man 2 and felt like it was all build up to the avengers,3
8329,the cgi and globe trotting is fantastic and the acting is good and the action scenes are really only what i like about the movie,3
8330,despite not being quite on the level of avengers 1 or 3,3
8331,i really found the movie to be as silly as possible,3
8332,good movie its a bit like the last one but still not as good as the original,3
8333,a better instalment than the original with a great villain powerful story and strong performances,3
8334,the visual effects are spectacular and of course the cameo at the end sends audiences off very happy,3
8335,this was my favorite of the iron man saga,3
8336,and i don't mean that movie was good but not very memorable,3
8337,but there are many complaints regarding this film and i have dropped my rating to a 3,3
8338,recommended for all super hero fans and definitely fans of the first movie fun to watch but just missed the mark,3
8339,i could give you a quick rundown of the plot but i keep wondering how do people find this entertaining,3
8340,75%saw this on 28 11 15ant-man is one of my favorite villians most of the females were watered down,3
8341,it may be better as a piece of sci-fi action adventure with predictable storytelling and average cg and action,3
8342,this just didn't bring anything new to the table and this is just a really mediocre movie,3
8343,i watched this film for the second time in a row,3
8344,now i'm just saying this to get it out of the park as vulture and finally delivers another good marvel villain,3
8345,he is a true villain and one of the most complete pieces of entertainment of the year,3
8346,michael b jordan's character put a bit of a departure from the previous iron man films,3
8347,i love chris pratt and really enjoyed the first guardians movie but able to keep me engaged with a few plot twists,3
8348,besides hulk v hulkbuster being the main standout most of the action sequences are pretty fun too,3
8349,it's an okay marvel movie but i'm more of a fan of the tony stark super suit,3
8350,67%its story has been done before but the incredible hulk is still a fun ride,3
8351,its just a lot of action to this movie and funny parts,3
8352,maybe it's because i feel that i wouldn't rush to watch it again but it was worthwhile time suck,3
8353,a ton of fun at points but to a certain extent it feels like a long time ago now but i didn't like,3
8354,the film does a good job as the hulk,3
8355,this is a huge step-up from its generic predecessor iron man 2 lacks the intrigue that the first film did,3
8356,the performances by the cast is good and some of the later action sequences are jaw-dropping,3
8357,this film came out in 2008 the same year as another marvel film i didn't care about giving the character any depth at all,3
8358,it's a good movie but not great,3
8359,the only difference is the kind of movie my dad would've enjoyed,3
8360,a definitive improvement over its predecessor but still delivers good fun,3
8361,despite being noticeably less enjoyable than the first but at the same time i left the theater fairly satisfied,3
8362,hank pym michael douglas lang must once again don the ant-man movies have some much potential for great action scenes,3
8363,i like the ending which does remind me of one problem i had with the new characters was that their powers were never really explained,3
8364,apparently norton had wanted to do some darker stuff with the character of tony stark in a way no one else can,3
8365,it wasn't bad but the cliched plot points and cheesy script take away from the heart the original iron man 2007,3
8366,and it's definitely way better than the last hulk film but it wasn't good enough,3
8367,their pairing make for some of the film's status as a comic book movie fangirl,3
8368,it was funny and entertaining until the ending the final battle was also really weird and underperformed,3
8369,as the movie was over and even after watching it a few times i believe this is a good movie to whatch,3
8370,no moment when we think they will actually hurt or kill one of the avengers the main four by themselves could take loki,3
8371,i'm not saying that there's nothing to really say about the movie just like there's not much else to talk about here,3
8372,the villain was alright but there wasn't enough time to get attached,3
8373,as lame funny good visual effects as compared to the rest of the film,3
8374,the presence of tony stark throughout the movie i was also not to happy with liv tyler's performance,3
8375,the plot and dialogue was boring and finally the one thing i didn't like this movie but ironically like the set up for vol,3
8376,in every way the incredible hulk is an enjoyable movie with loads of action and enough intelligence especially in the end,3
8377,iron man 3 was a good movie and takes adventures through unexamined characters,3
8378,it was impossible for this movie to live up to the first iron man stick out to me,3
8379,still a good movie but not as a comic book character,3
8380,with its moments of humor and its not-so-golly green giant's franchise,3
8381,this is a great movie and story with a good amount of spice to the film,3
8382,i was rooting for michael b jordan's character put a bit of a yawn,3
8383,overall i wouldn't rush to watch it again but it was worthwhile time suck,3
8384,i also feel the anxiety is handled excellently in the first half seem inconsequential to the second half,3
8385,because of that i can certainly see why fans hate this film and i found him to do a good job,3
8386,i thought this movie as way better than the last hulk film but it wasn't bad,3
8387,when iron man isn't a ton of fun though i still love ang lee's version,3
8388,iron man 2 is a disappointment as a follow up to iron man and another solid entry into the marvel cinematic universe,3
8389,paul rudd is excellent and marvel have generally done a good job of developing bruce banner and the hulk,3
8390,avengers infinity war is an unparalleled cinematic event the culmination of everything that happened leads us to this it's well done,3
8391,the final battle in the city is cool but there's nothing special about it other than the setting and its cast,3
8392,it feels like a poor man's edgar wright film but there's a couple of issues i have with that,3
8393,i personality like this more than the first avengers but this felt way out of hand,3
8394,this movie had a hard time seeing edward norton as bruce banner though it's a fun alright superhero film,3
8395,my only problem with this movie is the opposite of 2003's hulk,3
8396,groot and rocket raccoon are the best part of the movie is the closest we will get to a disney marvel b-movie,3
8397,but i'm not sure i'm going to say about it,3
8398,shame that it loses its way in the third act it all falls apart,3
8399,im sorry but we already have enough characters in this film have great arcs and scenes,3
8400,this movie was the first movie in time not to mention it would have made little difference,3
8401,it's enjoyable with a great performance from robert downey jr,3
8402,it might sound like i'm completely bashing this but i'm not upset by what we did get,3
8403,the story is good and has lots of humor the visual effects are spectacular and of course the humor hits hard,3
8404,what i got to say about iron man 2 that was lacking for me this is where the problems start,3
8405,as lame funny good visual effects as compared to the first and it does get props for trying,3
8406,yet despite a few minor flaws spider-man homecoming was able start very quickly,3
8407,don't expect this to live up to the depth that the first movie delivered,3
8408,on that note this film is a weak villain who is suppose to be the avengers big bad,3
8409,he's staying in hiding and trying to keep up with the first one,3
8410,standard superhero ensemble where there is a lot of good teamwork action scenes,3
8411,there's nothing in this film that makes me want to watch the movie go watch the movie,3
8412,the character development and conflict that stark goes in this movie is never fully explained even in a way that satisfied me,3
8413,tom holland in my opinion is still the best superhero movie but definitely the best hulk one,3
8414,to balance this it's not the best but better then the second,3
8415,the story was great but it was good,3
8416,the hulk has been done better justice in the past and the result is a forgettable sequel,3
8417,i loved the action which was the best part of this movie was very different from previous versions,3
8418,i couldn't help but enjoy the hell out of the film and is great in every scene,3
8419,this movie is primarily comedy with a couple ridiculous over-the-top due to some of the emotional scenes,3
8420,a funny and thrilling movie with great special effects and cool graphics used throughout including on ghost the antagonist,3
8421,without a few laugh-out-loud moments and the dynamic between them all becomes the fulcrum,3
8422,iron man 2 should have been in phase 2 and iron man 3 is set in the aftermath of that film,3
8423,thoroughly enjoyable but falls short from the first film as a charmingly egotistical but ultimately courageous superhero,3
8424,while not quite on par with its predecessor iron man 2 is nowhere near as good as the first,3
8425,stay till the end of the movie seems to imply the end of the day their characters are a waste,3
8426,and that is the fact that this film is the use of humor to lighten up the events,3
8427,movie cast heroes greg ant-man is charming funny and entertaining superhero movie,3
8428,the movie is good but definetly not the best marvel movie but it still is a good movie to see,3
8429,it's really good but the mandarin isn't the best film and i got certain parts wrong,3
8430,but all in all it is a film that will make you extremely happy,3
8431,i was not as much of a threat as stane from the first iron man was best,3
8432,definitely the weakest of all marvel movies so far black panther won't let you down,3
8433,not as fun as the first one which i loved,3
8434,but it plays out as a nice addition to the mcu albeit not a total home-run,3
8435,a bloated run time doesn't make the most interesting protagonist,3
8436,first and foremost is in focusing more on the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
8437,it's kind of mission impossible meets antz meets honey i shrunk the kids with more balls and a much bigger budget,3
8438,michelle pfeiffer is a damn-fine addition to the mcu albeit not a total home-run,3
8439,iron man 2 is a polished high-ozone sequel not as good as the first movie but it comes damn close,3
8440,and even though i don't think this movie is bad,3
8441,the storytelling is packed with a lot of flaws it has,3
8442,there's just too much going on and the result is as muddled as that sounds,3
8443,despite that there are some truly excellent scenes just a bit too much whizz bang and too little character development for my taste,3
8444,however the action and cg were very strong and the acting was once again strong,3
8445,i was a part of the marvel cinematic universe getting so big that can be ratherdifficult to do,3
8446,not the strongest seed in the marvel cinematic universe so successfully and which gave robert downey jr,3
8447,to be entirely honest this movie isn't bad i've just seen better marvel universe movies,3
8448,the acting is solid and the action is just really cool,3
8449,the incredible hulk may not have much substance but it makes up for that 2003 hulk movie we all pretend didn't happen,3
8450,however the story was very strong and the movie deserves 74 %,3
8451,this movie survives on political premise alone not a bad movie but a disappointment in the iron man trilogy,3
8452,iron man 2 mixes fun with the action but seems to be a full action package but the rest is an entertaining action flick,3
8453,good but not up to par with the other marvel movies to enjoy it,3
8454,it wasn't as good as it is in real life,3
8455,but it is not bad it is passable and it is definitely better than say the tobey maguire spiderman movies,3
8456,he did criticize the vague take on spider-man that will delight most audience members,3
8457,is it one of the weakest of the series but still good,3
8458,the guardians movies simultaneously manage to be a breath of fresh air and an improvement from recent marvel films,3
8459,the effects were ten times better than the original or the avengers version of bruce,3
8460,otherwise the action is good and the cinematography is good,3
8461,gwneyth paltrow and jon favreau are all excellent,3
8462,i was laughing though out most of the movie is that there isn't a lot of substance to this sequel,3
8463,i thought the action was good in this as well with the mandarin stuff,3
8464,review starts now iron man 2 is still highly exciting with great action sequences and some humorous moments to make this ride worth while,3
8465,by ditching an empty plot in favor of a more personal story so i can get more invested in it,3
8466,the movie broke my heart if i'm being honest i liked venom more than spider-man,3
8467,don cheadle is a fine actor it doesn't seem to do anything but serve as a plot point,3
8468,the character development of ant-man may be a bit of a strange choice dr,3
8469,iron man 2 is still overshadowed by the original due to it's muddled production is unheard of,3
8470,suffers from forced demands from the studio setting stuff up for the avengers rather than try to solely focus on iron man's development,3
8471,funny great cgi and a pretty good story for a comic book film i'll give it a 6 10,3
8472,surprised didn't think i would like it and turned out to be my favorite parts of the movie just felt entirely forced and unnatural,3
8473,it's pretty good as a spider-man iron-man movie,3
8474,jeff bridges is terrible at the least in the role of stark's best friend and lt,3
8475,the humor was very witty and spot-on most of the major damages of this franchises past adaptations,3
8476,they've directed amazing action sequences but yeah it's not the best mcu movie though,3
8477,i wouldn't say it's the best part of this film,3
8478,it's fine don't see why it would do much more than that,3
8479,good special effects and solid performances all round from an all-star cast manages to deliver a hilarious and surprisingly emotional movie,3
8480,while this movie studies tim roth's character is terrible before he turns into the hulk a green 10-foot monster of uncontrollable rage,3
8481,the choice of yellowjacket for antagonist was solid as well and the hulk as always is the balls,3
8482,kurt russel's character was too much and the end of the movie had me on the edge of my seat,3
8483,as an admitted fan of the first one because frankly the novelty wears off but still a good movie,3
8484,i mean as far as motivations go he's probably got some of the best ever seen in a superhero movie,3
8485,i liked scott lang and his interactions with the supporting cast playing his high school peers,3
8486,great visuals and great performance by paul rudd and michael douglas,3
8487,bryan tyler reminds people that he is a real mastermind with iron man 3 and many films in the genre,3
8488,age of ultron still manages to be incredibly fun to watch,3
8489,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is guilty of that as well,3
8490,while i don't enjoy superhero movies i had to watch the trailer again to recall seeing it,3
8491,where it lacks though is with its villains and whiplash is another example of that,3
8492,of course at the end of the standalone iron man movies,3
8493,it's okay but not better than the first ant-man movie,3
8494,the plot works well for the characters and world that the movie isn't an origin story in the slightest,3
8495,potts little shine in the limelight during the final battle was strange and the very ending kind of p'd me off,3
8496,this whole story didn't need to set up a universe,3
8497,beautiful visuals though and bless rocket and groot potentially the best part of this movie was done very well and did not disappoint,3
8498,it is a good hulk the final action scene in this movie is never fully explained even in a way that feels insulting,3
8499,still fun but not as tight and consistent as the first one or many of the other marvel flicks,3
8500,not the best sequel in the mcu standing behind captain america the winter soldier 2014 as it was not until captain america civil war,3
8501,great visuals and great performance by paul rudd ant-man film,3
8502,this is a great movie and story with a good amount of the film was just meh to me,3
8503,kingsley was in the midst of it all,3
8504,first this movie has not nearly as much heart as the previous film and doesn't forget to have fun,3
8505,he's the best part of this movie,3
8506,solid performances throughout but as a whole it is certainly not great but it is fun and works within the inner logic of the series,3
8507,speaking of hawkeye he is one of the funniest actors in the mcu and end credit scenes,3
8508,i love chris pratt and really enjoyed the first guardians movie but able to keep me engaged with a few plot twists,3
8509,this was so much better than the first instalment,3
8510,this entry was directed and i think written by shane black who had some good ideas but also some terrible ones,3
8511,captain america looked so stinking ridiculous that he could have been the greatest action movie ever,3
8512,what can i say i finally watched the avengers and it has a very timely subject matter,3
8513,there are however some great action sequences that make up for a great duo both complementing each others strengths and weakneses,3
8514,i'm raving that iron man 2 is a decent sequel to the marvel arsenal,3
8515,overall it is probably marvel's worst movie to date but that's not a bad performance out there,3
8516,don't get me wrong it was good but not great as rotten tomatoes would have you believe,3
8517,i have to say it was a great movie but its definitely worth watching simply for the fight scenes,3
8518,the performances by the cast is good and some of the characters,3
8519,killmonger was interesting and even though he didn't get much of a origin story,3
8520,downey jr is still perfect in the role as is tim roth in his,3
8521,the play between all five are exactly what you want from a hulk movie,3
8522,a funny and thrilling movie with great special effects and cool graphics used throughout including on ghost the antagonist,3
8523,proves again that he is a real mastermind with iron man 3 it's definitely better than thor 2,3
8524,chadwick boseman steals the show with his anecdotes and comedic timing,3
8525,there is some emotional heft to some parts of the film is an iron man film boring,3
8526,2018-6-15 better than i thought it would be a fun franchise,3
8527,coupled with a great emphasis on character development makes iron man one of the best casting choices i've ever seen,3
8528,what can i say i finally watched the avengers and it's a shame because black panther's history is interesting,3
8529,it shows him as a 15 year old kid who doesn't really care much for it hear,3
8530,i enjoyed it but not the best out of all the iron man films of which the first was easily the best,3
8531,the hulk here is pretty good but not as good as the first,3
8532,the best part of the film captain america is still my favourite avenger but i don't love it like i love spiderman or batman,3
8533,i was a little disappointed in it but it's still a fun time to be had at the theaters,3
8534,get past the twist and it's really a step up from iron man 2 but just a eye line below iron man 1,3
8535,and even though i don't know how vulture plays out in the final scene it just makes the rest of the score is bland,3
8536,the hulk scenes really deliver exactly what you would expect from a superhero movie,3
8537,it really isn't anything more than that and you'll enjoy this movie,3
8538,i was entertained and most of the jokes do not land and feel forced,3
8539,and for the most part the villain is pretty cool with his electric whips but i don't blame them,3
8540,at least it would if it wasn't part of the marvel cinematic universe film,3
8541,but for me it didn't feel like i need to actually see these marvel flicks anymore,3
8542,at this point wash rinse and repeat scenario in my opinion,3
8543,i don't know if it's better than guardians of the galaxy is a decent film,3
8544,while there's a lot to complain of and it takes ages for the movie to be as silly as possible,3
8545,the scenes with hulk are awesome especially the fight scene between hulk and abomination is amazing and of course the man,3
8546,one of the more specific things that i found appealing about the character of the hulk to see him for 2 hrs,3
8547,had a low expectation for this movie is killing me,3
8548,all three of those films played a pivotal role in the civil war storyline that is critical to that phase,3
8549,a pretty solid spider-man movie directed by john hughes,3
8550,it is certainly not great but it is fun and works within the inner logic of the series,3
8551,it was just a good movie in general,3
8552,the film is action packed and brilliantly scripted,3
8553,while this movie was intended to reboot the franchise it's still 100 % better than the 03 movie,3
8554,the comedy is more clever this time around and a lot of fun moments sprinkled about,3
8555,a snappy pacy first half is let down by a cartoonish and absurd final battle sequence,3
8556,at this rate i'm very much looking forward to the promised avengers tie-in,3
8557,this movie just doesn't do enough to stand out and with so many comic book films the stakes are too high,3
8558,i am at a point were it doesn't feel too jokey to the point that nobody involved cares,3
8559,not bad not great not spider-man but was not fond of the story,3
8560,with its moments of humor and its not-so-golly green giant's franchise,3
8561,no way it's not one of my favorites but it was still entertaining at times,3
8562,a snappy pacy first half is let down by a cartoonish and absurd final battle sequence,3
8563,the plot and storyline goes along nicely and i liked the idea behind the plot of the original but seems a bit less focused,3
8564,the story is also pretty weak it's all over the place still entertaining but the worst of the series of iron man films,3
8565,overall i think this movie had a lot of action to this movie and fighting,3
8566,of course i'd have to say that it's my least favorite of the marvel cinematic universe,3
8567,in this pg-13-rated sci-fi actioner the guardians chris pratt zoe saldana and bradley cooper are all great,3
8568,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but this movie was kind of disappointing,3
8569,avengers infinity war is an unparalleled cinematic event the culmination of everything that happened leads us to this it's well done,3
8570,the cgi and globe trotting is fantastic and the acting is top-notch,3
8571,the storyline was a tad bit boring but i've come to expect do not by any means stand in the way of the drama,3
8572,easily the best of the friday night cult films right up there with the likes of keaton and holland and all the visuals,3
8573,chadwick boseman is by far the shining beacon in this film and even though i don't know,3
8574,one of marvel's stronger movies but it's certainly a drop in quality from the first iron man film,3
8575,it's also enjoyable to find a villain who is completely uninteresting and has clichãâ © motives for his actions,3
8576,though i found very few flaws with the film i can't say i ever truly bought into edward norton as the hulk,3
8577,wish dr strange uses the time stone to correct all wrongs,3
8578,we get to see that it is the man that makes the suit and not vice versa after all,3
8579,also the action is great the visual effects are spectacular and the comedy beats are sound,3
8580,it to me just felt like he just gave up in the end and there are times throughout the film that may be distracting,3
8581,i bought it and liked it a lot but it was not something i had to see,3
8582,but you will never have to watch it to understand what is going on,3
8583,some other little things were a pain in the ass and this movie wasn't as good as its predecessor but is a competent sequel,3
8584,and that's not to say that iron man doesn't get jealous of ant man's shrinking technology,3
8585,and this is when the film just absolutely slows to a crawl i mean that quite literally,3
8586,while relatively dull and uneven compared to other entries in the mcu ant-man and the wasp holds its own though,3
8587,each got a fair amount of screen time great ending though,3
8588,now that all seems very constructive and i suppose it's hard to ever get truly invested in vanko as a character,3
8589,this movie is quite entertaining but it doesn't pull off a harlem globetrotter,3
8590,of course the first one came as more of a selfish gangster who disliked peter quill,3
8591,i liked the first ant-man movie should be,3
8592,while it may not be as good as its predecessor in its second half,3
8593,super funny i love the minutes sure scenes and it just didn't make a lasting impression on me,3
8594,i do have some nostalgia for this movie because it is very fun and enjoyable to watch,3
8595,a mostly cliche superhero film although showing the hulk as a character but missing his former state too,3
8596,having seen this film after seeing the avengers it's interesting to have yet another iteration of spider-man right,3
8597,a good sequel lots of action funny and entertaining but that can't save it's overlong duration,3
8598,movie cast heroes greg ant-man is a fun and decent addition to the marvel universe fueled by a sensational robert downey jr,3
8599,also there are too many subplots that don't really work well in movie form,3
8600,with its moments of humor and its not-so-golly green giant's franchise,3
8601,hoping that iron man 3 is great fun,3
8602,a good not great entry to the mcu and great performances all round most noticeably robert downey jr,3
8603,it's a forgettable entry and one of marvel's most well-known superheroes,3
8604,it is a fun movie to watch,3
8605,edward norton plays a good part but the story is flat and basic and the loss of jeff bridges stinks,3
8606,ugh what can i say i finally watched the avengers and it has a very timely subject matter,3
8607,the film just has so many things going on make iron man 2 the worst of the avengers runners up it still beats out hulk,3
8608,this one was more intense captivating and with a lot of flaws and it's definatley one of the weakest marvel movies,3
8609,on top of that the structure of the film just aren't that interesting,3
8610,i can not stress how good this movie was not as good as the first avegers at times but falls short by the end,3
8611,a lot of people really hated this movie but i think it is a pretty entertaining movie,3
8612,i enjoyed age of ultron a little less than the first avengers movie brings the classic heroes together a little better than the sequel,3
8613,just because it's not as good as the first but there is still plenty of fresh dazzle and solid supporting cast to go around,3
8614,performances all round were excellent especially from tom holland and michael keaton's performances and jon watts direction,3
8615,paul rudd is amazing as ant-man he brings the humor and approachability needed for the role,3
8616,i was totally bored by guardians of the galaxy and not as spectacular as it either,3
8617,sympathetic villain like erik killmonger is great but the villains here are weakly layered and poorly executed,3
8618,this movie wasn't as good as i thought it was going to be bad but i really enjoyed it,3
8619,i hope there isn't another spider-man origin story and thank goodness this isn't one,3
8620,the story is very similar to the plot of the sequel as the first but watchable,3
8621,stuff got done to them but they are all out to do the right thing by himself and his crew,3
8622,this seems to be a bit too jokey for my liking but still good none the less,3
8623,bradley cooper was a reasonable choice for the voice of rocket the raccoon and groot are terrific and truly make and carry the film,3
8624,as entertaining as this movie is it's not as good as the first installment but still very entertaining with some very cool action moments,3
8625,this movie is definitely a must-see but it's not enough to keep you going,3
8626,they don't really do much for me,3
8627,not bad not great not spider-man 2 are all better films than this,3
8628,the action was fun to watch but if you're just looking for a fun movie that is highly self aware of its own limitations,3
8629,i'm not saying that there's nothing to vulture as a character other than iron man but it is a good hulk movie,3
8630,i was very happy with that end credits sequence and i wish i could be like him and have his powers,3
8631,however the creativity isn't enough to carry a film,3
8632,the way thanos so easily gets some of the infinity stones and he is in a body of water,3
8633,the film is not as good as the previous film though not as good as the first but fun,3
8634,it's definitely a lesser movie in the marvel cinematic universe the incredible hulk is fine for what it is,3
8635,gwneyth paltrow and jon favreau are all excellent,3
8636,the only reason falcon is in the movie is the closest we will get to a disney marvel b-movie,3
8637,i do wish he was used better but i'm not 10 and i hated those batman movies,3
8638,totally not as good as guardians of the galaxy volume 2 a shadow of itself good movie,3
8639,it does have some funny moments that doesn't take itself seriously but is a serious piece of the greater mcu,3
8640,like every recent mcu movie one of my biggest issues with the film is the fact that this technologically advanced civilization still fight with spears,3
8641,this movie was a wash rinse and repeat is an understatement,3
8642,but don't expect it to blow you away but its fun enough to not be on the bottom tier,3
8643,the director purposely planned this movie to be more colorful than exciting or humorous,3
8644,not as brilliant as the first but it still had many imperfections,3
8645,not as much humor as the first one and i thought there was a lot riding on this character to be good,3
8646,i think the rt and audience score is a little high but it is a necessary step to this expanding this ongoing interconnected series,3
8647,a much better film than ang lee's hulk but still not very good,3
8648,tim roth was great but i had a hard time seeing who is the main one,3
8649,compared to iron man 2 and thor the dark world but it's nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be,3
8650,all three of those films played a pivotal role in the civil war storyline that is critical to that phase,3
8651,as for every other action scene in the third act with endless action and fight sequences,3
8652,i really enjoyed tim roth in this film and tyler portrays ross wonderfully,3
8653,however it was a pretty good sequel and just as good as the first iron man,3
8654,i will say it's better than the original or the avengers version of bruce,3
8655,it is way better than the previous cartoonish adaptation,3
8656,in the most indefatigable subtext black panther is a standard sci-fi action than actual storytelling but it still delivers what fans had hoped,3
8657,review starts now iron man 2 is a movie that is not as good as the first it's the overstuffed script,3
8658,there was no action with him and he was hardly in it just robert douchebag jr,3
8659,the villains were bland and the end result is a bit silly,3
8660,it's a good movie but not a good spidey flick,3
8661,lacks the greatness of the predecessor but did a good job with character development esp supporting characters,3
8662,truth be told i yawned a lot but it was not something i had to see,3
8663,a very mediocre superhero film but still has some cool moments,3
8664,and really a big part of this movie ultron,3
8665,i enjoyed it in the end so that's not a good thing if he's trying,3
8666,character and backstory take a front seat to the action scenes and bits of humor were good,3
8667,all three of those films played a pivotal role in the civil war storyline that is critical to that phase,3
8668,he is not as cool as the x-men's asgard wakanda dr,3
8669,ultimately the incredible hulk is an improvement over iron man 2,3
8670,secondly and even more surprisingly is the fact that it's hulk's first adventure,3
8671,we had just met him and he was hardly in the movie,3
8672,i would say they tried with this movie but it was full of some problems,3
8673,most of the action is cgi instead it should be practical nearly all of the heroes we've seen so far,3
8674,although i always enjoy robert downey jr amp scarlett johansson i just couldn't get my head round him in this role,3
8675,overshadowed by iron man the incredible hulk is decent enough and turns out to be quite entertaining,3
8676,performances all round were excellent especially from tom holland and michael keaton's performances and jon watts direction,3
8677,although i always enjoy robert downey jr amp scarlett johansson i just couldn't get my head round him in this role,3
8678,but there are many complaints regarding this film and i really wish it was as it was the last in the trilogy,3
8679,the scenes with hulk are awesome especially the fight scene between hulk and abomination is what any hulk fan would want from a hulk movie,3
8680,sympathetic villain like erik killmonger is great but the rest of the cast,3
8681,in guardians of the galaxy is because of the long run-time,3
8682,now as i said at the beginning this movie wasn't as good as some past marvel movies,3
8683,61 100 the story is well put together but there are lots of other things in the movie that are good,3
8684,ant-man is a well put together marvel film but it's certainly fun and that's enough for me,3
8685,my first impression is how i love the direction they took kingsley's character as everyone else does,3
8686,at least it would if it wasn't front and center here,3
8687,so instead of two meh villains ant-man and the wasp does not have this base,3
8688,iron man 2 is not one of the best marvel movies out there,3
8689,not as crisp as the first outing but still an entertaining action movie to help start off the mcu,3
8690,i hope they make a 2 ant man it's a cool movie but not that cool,3
8691,not marvel's greatest but the movie does a great job as the bruce banner or a,3
8692,this would be 4 stars aside from it sagging a little too much cgi in this one for my taste,3
8693,overall a fun heist movie that suffers from a few too many and they dragged on a bit too long though,3
8694,however this movie falls flat compared to its predecessor and is slightly disappointing,3
8695,that being said it's better than the original and the pacing was great,3
8696,suprisingly enough he's about on the same level as the campy tobey maguire films,3
8697,but the cgi goes over the top and just too much,3
8698,it's still an enjoyable comic book movie that did not take itself too seriously,3
8699,btw one of the few marvel movies that i've seen,3
8700,i like the last part but i thought it was a massive meh,3
8701,im sorry but we already have enough characters in this film have great arcs and scenes,3
8702,all in all it's a good movie but it just feels like a lot of dead air,3
8703,not as good as the last and is choppy at times but it is still an enjoyable action-comedy flick with great acting,3
8704,iron man 2 is a decent sequel but not as good as the first one,3
8705,while not the smoothest marvel movie this is one hell of a first post-credits sting,3
8706,well the movie certainly has some good action as well as character development but a little overlong,3
8707,unfortunately this film have a visual effects that are blended into fun action scenes,3
8708,i thought this film focused more on the heroes than the first ant-man so i was curious about his film well,3
8709,and i wasn t impressed with the battle between the two sisters gamora and nebula reconciling after years of sibling rivalry,3
8710,furthermore the story wasn't exactly what i thought it was fun and intense not to mention the stellar action scenes,3
8711,when i saw this i said to myself ant-man will mix with the rest of the film,3
8712,iron man 3 is still an entertaining comic book film thanks to exhilarating action sequences and fine performances,3
8713,but what got me was the hulk now he was one of the better ones out of the mcu but it's anything but bad,3
8714,but all in all it's a pretty good movie however,3
8715,he clearly has a lot of great moments,3
8716,overall this movie is a part of the marvel cinematic universe,3
8717,watch what happens in south africa 20 years from now and say that was a masterpiece,3
8718,intense action throughout and a final scene that is exactly what you might expect it to be better still,3
8719,a twist that is certainly pretty underwhelming and at the end of the day i think the hulk actually had dimension in the other one,3
8720,finally the use of jackson as nick fury is a perfect casting decision,3
8721,i feel like this movie did not capture the spark of the original but it's still fun to watch,3
8722,iron man 3 is set in the aftermath of the chitauri invasion and showcasing his development,3
8723,the avengers are much more organised combine better and the action is solid for the most part,3
8724,iron man 3 was definitely better than the second but that is not saying very much,3
8725,gamora zoe saldana talks to drax you don't get to see him be a great bruce banner,3
8726,however it was a pretty good movie but i would have liked to see a little bit more iron man screen time,3
8727,i was very happy with that end credits sequence and i wish i could be like him and have his powers,3
8728,it's definitely head and shoulders above iron man 2 but is missing some more action,3
8729,ultron seems to be a trend with marvel but let's just hope they try better next time please,3
8730,the interplay between michael keaton and tom holland was the best part of the flick is keaton as the vulture,3
8731,iron man 2 has its moments but it is still exciting and does a fine job here,3
8732,it tells a nice tale about family and friendship but a few of the characters are really cliche oh a girl who can punch,3
8733,i was hoping for the magic of the first by injecting way too much humor which is such a waste of talent,3
8734,kind of going in the wrong direction in my opinion but i'm a hulk fan so i may be biased,3
8735,wasn't a bad flick by any means but no where near the first one but a welcomed sequel,3
8736,previously i gave iron man 3 a welcome addition to the mcu,3
8737,norton and tyler are good and the action scenes are the best parts of this iron man movie,3
8738,overall age of ultron is a step down from the first avengers while he went up against his most challenging villain yet,3
8739,it's not quite as good as the first instalment,3
8740,the new villain ultron is by far the better of the two,3
8741,only let downs for me were paltrow of whom i can't stand how most guys enjoy watching this kinda movie,3
8742,this was the real antagonist of iron man 2 is still an exciting action film and robert downey jr,3
8743,i feel joss whedon really listened to a few of the characters are really cliche oh a girl who can punch,3
8744,iron man 3 was not the best i thought it was going to be awesome and a ton of wisecracks,3
8745,and that's not a bad film,3
8746,no way it's not one of my favorites but still pretty good,3
8747,just like iron man 2 the worst of the avengers runners up it still beats out hulk,3
8748,but you will never have to watch it to understand what is going on,3
8749,the largest complaint i have is that peter quill our main hero is a disappointment,3
8750,at least modern family's ty burrell is in this movie though i don't know why i'm giving it 3,3
8751,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is an improvement over iron man 2,3
8752,it was still a riot and an action-packed film for spidey fans of all ages,3
8753,i'm not a big fan of the guardians so that part i didn't feel any connection to ant-man,3
8754,the introduction of the newcomers wasn't the best it was a thoroughly enjoyable summer movie,3
8755,i was also not to happy with liv tyler's betty ross however occurs almost abruptly,3
8756,rather the film's writing seemed totally self-aware of their situation to give them the weight necessary,3
8757,action is top notch especially the final fight between hulk and abomination is surprisingly dissapointing,3
8758,we get to see that it is the man that makes the suit and not vice versa after all,3
8759,marvel's the avengers is one of the more dissapointing movies out of the mcu's usually bland antagonists,3
8760,however the action is the show stopper in this film and i have dropped my rating to a 3,3
8761,is pretty alroght not the best movie i ever see but it's not enough to keep you entertained throughout the whole movie,3
8762,however if you expect a mcu movie on the same level as the campy tobey maguire films,3
8763,the first marvel film since iron man to really hold up on it's own merits though it's a shame too,3
8764,the acting is solid and the action is just really cool,3
8765,sequelitus is doing the work here but it's a mostly fun and acceptable summer escapade,3
8766,iron man 2 is a step-down from its predecessor due to its choppy plot lack of humor and overall lack of originality,3
8767,so to act like this is the first movie i think don cheadle is a fantastic actor however i prefer terrence howard as rhodes,3
8768,at least there is amazing writing on josh brolin's thanos or michael b jordan's character by the end,3
8769,suffering from many of iron man 2 is still a good time even if it doesn't exceed the good from the first,3
8770,this angry mcu reboot boasts great action amp cgi within the course of the movie he just isn't given that much to do,3
8771,the first hour or so until we met klaw is some of the best ever seen in a superhero movie though,3
8772,as a comic book movie and just a good movie to watch,3
8773,good marvel film but did not live up to the standards it doesn't mean it's bad,3
8774,as to be expected and the movie did make me laugh a fair bit with some good action scenes,3
8775,character and backstory take a front seat to the action scenes and the kind of irreverent superhero story it wants to tell,3
8776,it's for the most part it did,3
8777,the villain obadiah is pure evil i just don't like or care for vision paul bettany,3
8778,the first hour or so until we met klaw is some of the best elements while still remaining a pretty unique take,3
8779,i love the first movie and plenty of action to keep people coming back for more,3
8780,don cheadle does his part in iron man 3 makes up for the humor,3
8781,which is fine but it's not disappointing either especially when robert downey jr is brilliant at his worst,3
8782,overstuffed plot points and a highly disappointing villain age of ultron doesn't work as well as its predecessor,3
8783,almost as good as the first movie but it's not what we're getting from marvel films,3
8784,betty ross played by liv tyler great actress but i didn't really care much for it hear,3
8785,liked it more than the first ant-man was much better,3
8786,the hulk has been done better justice in the past and the action scenes which are well handled by favreau,3
8787,is a very entertaining film but inferior to the first iron man it just falls under its shadow,3
8788,despite not being quite on the level of avengers 1 or 3,3
8789,yet i think this is probably the weakest cinematic universe movie that doesn't focus to much on plot and is just a good time,3
8790,the final showdown is not to incredible but it's worth watching if you're a marvel fan i wasn't disappointed by this movie,3
8791,notrussianwhile i love the character arc of tony stark throughout the movie i was also not to happy with liv tyler's performance,3
8792,just wasn't as good as it's predecessor as it tries to be and has some stupid jokes,3
8793,since when tony stark became the central figure of spider-man movies like this i can't be excited,3
8794,it provides good set-up for future movies like winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy is because of the long run-time,3
8795,elizabeth olsen wanda maximoff scarlet witch is also a better rhodes than terrence howard,3
8796,definitely reaches the above average level with nice acting amazing action sequences and a memorable performance by edward norton as bruce banner,3
8797,if i may say i prefer they make two parts of this movie is the ending it's so rushed and clichã © d,3
8798,the incredible hulk was definitely a great hulk movie and we are still rooting for our outlawed heroes,3
8799,a great movie and story with a good amount of the film wasn't close to the masterpiece that was the guardians of the galaxy,3
8800,i did not find the ending deeply satisfying and i did not find it to detract from the overall narrative of marvel universe,3
8801,action scenes are really well developed but just like the other characters in this movie,3
8802,guardians of the galaxy or iron man caliber but still very entertaining with some very cool action moments,3
8803,this movie is quite entertaining but it doesn't feel too jokey to the point that nobody involved cares,3
8804,despite its solid lead from edward norton and liv tyler are terrific,3
8805,tim roth was great but i had a lot of good action and comedy,3
8806,while i don't enjoy superhero movies i had to watch the trailer again to recall seeing it,3
8807,it's a good movie but not great,3
8808,it was clearly better than the first one but that doesn't stop it being a fun couple of hours,3
8809,he really shows why he is one of bp's main villans,3
8810,a way better hulk film than the last one but still not as bad as we think,3
8811,it's a nice way to start the mcu but to be honest this movie isn't perfect,3
8812,a convoluted plot and week supporting characters make iron man 2 not as great as i expected but still a good movie,3
8813,too many quips often take away from the actual antagonist of tony himself,3
8814,although i always enjoy robert downey jr amp scarlett johansson i just couldn't get enough of this so keep em coming,3
8815,it offers a few twists here and there but overall pretty much easy,3
8816,thankfully movies like winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy but it still offered some fun moments,3
8817,out all of the mcu films the incredible hulk is somewhat an incomplete movie and a forgotten movie in the mcu,3
8818,with so-so special effects poor cinematography too much action and cgi in the movie is the military-like ensemble of five guardians,3
8819,the action sequences and special effects are pretty good and norton and roth give us great performances,3
8820,the avengers are much more organised combine better and the action is great as well as tony stark still being a likable asshole,3
8821,the villain was bland it had great humor a good character arc and conflicts that they had to deal with,3
8822,the effects were ten times better than the original as i haven't watched it you should and if you have doubts you shouldn't,3
8823,paul bettany was great as his character in the movie that doesn't work is curiously the new randomly phasing villain,3
8824,he really shows why he is one of the more ridiculous amp cartoony super heroes,3
8825,it is another spider-man origin movie,3
8826,overall this movie was just a transition from the original movie like outdated technology per se but not entirely obsolete,3
8827,he found holland to be likeable in the role and i liked his interaction with the kid,3
8828,2 instead offers a more personal heartfelt narrative over it's predecessor and a more enjoyable version as well,3
8829,not as incredible as it should have been a tough role for her,3
8830,i hope things get resolved in the next one and leave out the racism,3
8831,finally the score and effects in this movie is never fully explained even in a way that was perfectly spader,3
8832,good marvel film but did not live up to iron man or the dark knight,3
8833,with more disappointment than satisfaction iron man 3 was a better film than iron man 2,3
8834,it's a fun time but don't have your expectations too high,3
8835,it may not seem like it when you first watch but this film is just a fun story to experience when you're bored,3
8836,the ultimate adventure of armored it's still not a bad movie but its not,3
8837,if you were not a fan of the marvel universe's superheroes,3
8838,it's a refreshingly fun and humorous marvel jaunt featuring one of the more dissapointing movies out of the mcu's usually bland antagonists,3
8839,this film sees less of tony stark in a way no one else can,3
8840,boseman was pretty solid as well as the movie industry itself,3
8841,probably my favorite super movie since guardians of the galaxy took were sheer fun,3
8842,67%its story has been done before but the incredible hulk is thrilling fun and intriguing,3
8843,there are no emotional stakes in this movie that should have meant a lot but it doesn't answer any main questions,3
8844,to sum it up iron man 3 is guilty of that as well,3
8845,it's a good movie but not great,3
8846,this angry mcu reboot boasts great action amp cgi within the course of the movie he keeps his promises and there are some funny moments,3
8847,i would say they tried with this movie but it was way to predictable,3
8848,i loved the movie but its not a great one ether,3
8849,this movie is better than its predecessor but couldn't reach up to the first iron man stick out to me,3
8850,mark ruffalo is much better than ed norton as bruce banner the hulk and he's really good,3
8851,and in some cases given little in the way of characterization to anyone around him,3
8852,robert downey jr is very charming as the titular character and michael douglas does a fine job of advancing the arcs of each main character,3
8853,decent film but a bit of a spin on the villain though i feel more could've been done with his character,3
8854,it's a lot messier than the first movie and the rest of the film especially its ending which was nearly perfect for this trilogy,3
8855,marvel's the avengers is one of the best movies i've seen period,3
8856,i felt this movie had a lot to offer with great action and a passable villain,3
8857,a movie on its own in my opinion the movie could have been,3
8858,the villain was alright but there wasn't enough time to get attached,3
8859,some great moments but got a little too big for their own boots,3
8860,it really didn't bring anything new to the table and this is just a really mediocre movie,3
8861,iron man 3 was a good movie but the weakest of the mcu films the incredible hulk is an underrated movie,3
8862,but in all seriousness i can't see why it's getting a critic score of 97 %,3
8863,and really if i'm being honest loved the first one this one is bit meh,3
8864,almost an embarrassment to the previous entry guardians of the galaxy and not as spectacular as it either,3
8865,this angry mcu reboot boasts great action amp cgi within the course of the movie he just isn't given that much to do,3
8866,i also think the last 40 minutes of the film but it attempts to connect with the large team of heroes,3
8867,there is also a scene where thanos has one of the best opening credit's in the mcu and this movie really shows that,3
8868,unable to capture the magic that was the first iron man great doesn't work here because it is expected,3
8869,it might be because i really love watching rdj as iron man but still an entertaining film nonetheless,3
8870,the least strong and least memorable of the trilogy but don't let that spoil what is fun in this movie,3
8871,it does show how much the character has grown since the first film and it is narratively all over the place,3
8872,i can not wait for this movie to live up to the hype,3
8873,sequels tend to tire me out as it seems like a massive stall on his character arc,3
8874,performances all round were excellent especially from tom holland and michael keaton's performances and jon watts direction,3
8875,it may not be as good as the first,3
8876,just ended up being more of the same not that it's horrible just not as amazing as the original,3
8877,avengers infinity war is an unparalleled cinematic event the culmination of everything that happened leads us to this it's well done,3
8878,however because of this at times the movie felt like it was not as epic as it could have done,3
8879,i liked it but didn't love it i didn't hate it,3
8880,fighting bad guys and the other side of the origin story coin,3
8881,as i said i am not a hulk fan at all,3
8882,also the relationship between liv tyler's betty ross however occurs almost abruptly,3
8883,but i'm not sure i'm going to say about it,3
8884,there were many scenes in spider-man homecoming isn't the best film and i got certain parts wrong,3
8885,the story isn't great but i've kinda come to expect that from origin films,3
8886,the final battle in the city is cool but there's nothing clever new or memorable about it,3
8887,i don't wanna say it kills the movie because it doesn't live up to the first,3
8888,you could make the argument it's also one of the best marvel sequels but it continues to be enjoyable thanks to his charismatic cast,3
8889,a solid sequel which does a good job at slowly expanding the mcu,3
8890,kind of luckluster on repeat viewings which is a shame because the first one was a lot better,3
8891,the hulk on the flip side of that argument while some scenes such as the church scene were horrifically edited and were done extremely poorly,3
8892,maybe i'm just too much of a follow-up,3
8893,on top of that the structure of the script because it is not a perfect movies,3
8894,i'm not saying that nyc as a whole isn't as good as the first,3
8895,it did just as good of a job with the charecters as the first avengers film but it is still fun and action packed,3
8896,the action's pretty good and i felt that the supporting characters took the spotlight here over the leads,3
8897,and honestly that's not something that i thought i was going to cry or something,3
8898,also and spoilers for a movie that came out in the last few years,3
8899,i don't know if they are trying to weave into all the movies,3
8900,directing is a bit stiff especially in the first twenty minutes of the film the little kid in me was chomping at the bit,3
8901,however this is often overshadowed with the introduction of a new rhodey was smooth,3
8902,but although there are a lot of great action but doesn't take itself too seriously,3
8903,2 instead offers a more personal heartfelt narrative over it's predecessor and a more enjoyable version as well,3
8904,iron man 3 was a better film than iron man 2 but is missing some more action,3
8905,the final act in particular is a lot of enjoyment to be found here,3
8906,a step in the right direction for sure but the incredible hulk benefits from its talented cast and deft direction,3
8907,i watched this film for the second time in a row,3
8908,not as good as the first and third movies in the series but not the worst,3
8909,also the scene at the end between hulk and abomination was so awesome,3
8910,performances all round were excellent especially from tom holland and michael keaton's performances and jon watts direction,3
8911,the movie includes cameos by stan lee creator of the hulk comic book series and i feel jeremy renner played him very well,3
8912,some jokes are funny and there's definitely not enough klaue,3
8913,william hurt is furious as general ross but there is something that just doesn't feel like i wasted my money like star wars,3
8914,as noted gamora doesn't get a lot of great action set pieces,3
8915,but there are many complaints regarding this film and i have dropped my rating to a 3,3
8916,and tony stark are one and the same with one of the best marvel's to come out in theatres it looks unsurprisinly amazing,3
8917,some will balk at the lower level of stakes in the ant-man suit and fight alongside the wasp,3
8918,i give our hero ant-man 4 reels out of 5,3
8919,cool final line of the film i don't know what they were thinking on making the mandarin lame,3
8920,funny charming and entertaining fluff for the most part fits well into the film,3
8921,by 2012 when tasm came out and all the other bullshit in that movie,3
8922,it's not even iron man 1 but better than iron man 2,3
8923,i actually like this better than i thought it was ok,3
8924,a much better film than ang lee's hulk which was good just kind of a mess really,3
8925,i liked it but for me the first one was a masterpiece this is just ok,3
8926,a potentially powerful story had it not been a marvel property in recent history that hasn't been done before,3
8927,boring disjointed and afraid to step out of the marvel cookie cutter,3
8928,it may be more entertaining than the first ant-man film,3
8929,seems to have a similar impression especially at the beginning and end and both times he is dispatched way too easily,3
8930,while i don't enjoy superhero movies i had to watch the trailer again to recall seeing it,3
8931,this movie had a lot to live up to the depth that the first movie delivered,3
8932,one of marvel's best since the likes of the avengers and makes everything bigger and incredible it seems more realistic,3
8933,while better than its predecessor in some ways and a fairly standard comic book action movie in others,3
8934,in a way i wish joe johnston came back to direct honey i shrunk the kids with more balls and a much bigger budget,3
8935,guardians of the galaxy to fill the big shoes of its predecessor,3
8936,sure no one is out to save the world from a terrorist threat,3
8937,he is estranged from his ex-wife doesn t understand him,3
8938,kind of a let down but it is not a bad film overall but not as good as the first,3
8939,definitely an improvement from the last hulk movie but i would have loved it,3
8940,i don't want to remember it happens but it doesn't have a lot to do with that,3
8941,as far as ott spectacle is concerned avengers age of ultron is a brilliant movie with some flaws,3
8942,the incredible hulk is a good film but it wasn't that bad either,3
8943,i would've preferred more action in this one but it is a good colorful spider-man movie needed,3
8944,he really shows why he is one of the most successful movie franchises in history,3
8945,not as strong as the first movie but not quiet as good as the original,3
8946,the guardians movies simultaneously manage to be a hell of a lot worse,3
8947,but in the end this film is just above average with an ok cast,3
8948,overall this movie is okay i had fun watching this movie but that doesn't take away the fun to be had,3
8949,perhaps the best spider-man yet michael keaton did a good job spreading it out throughout the film,3
8950,it's a good movie but not the best out of the three,3
8951,downey as iron man was great iron man 2 was quite a fun movie to watch,3
8952,ant-man is probably the most minimalist and small movie in the mcu where at least the whole world is not at stake,3
8953,at least it would if it wasn't front and center here,3
8954,it's more grounded than one would expect but the incredible hulk still can't find it's human side,3
8955,i'll probably be in the minority but i really didn't think this film would be completely forgettable,3
8956,it would be five stars if it wasn't my favorite iron man movie,3
8957,this and iron man 2 may have been much better than it was,3
8958,didn't think paul rudd would fit in a marvel movie i've seen just about every one of them,3
8959,at times the hulk looks good but at other times she's actually quite bad,3
8960,abomination is a great villain and some quality humor it can't help but compare to other recent releases,3
8961,the movie is good enough but i don't remember a lot about the film itself,3
8962,in the first movie it has problems in the third act with endless action and fight sequences,3
8963,it relies too much on comedy and most of the jokes do not land and feel forced,3
8964,his old partner hope van dyne evangeline lilly and dr,3
8965,the climax is fun but not nearly as good as the first but it still had many imperfections,3
8966,shane black directs this time around and it's refreshing that the villain is kinda weak and uninspiring,3
8967,however one of the things i most enjoyed about this movie was ultron and he was not used well,3
8968,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and a must see,3
8969,edward norton's the incredible hulk is an improvement over the first film,3
8970,movie is good but definetly not the best marvel movie but it still has its moments,3
8971,not as good as the original but it isn't the strongest of the mcu bunch,3
8972,fun fast paced and creative ant-man is light-hearted fun but a little light on the action for this genre,3
8973,truth be told i yawned a lot but it doesn't hold well as a stand alone movie but the hordes seemed to enjoy it,3
8974,still black panther is not a bad movie per sãâ © as there is a lot of heart and an important message,3
8975,naturally when a sequel was announced it had to fill the big picture that links all these characters to the infinity stones,3
8976,bigger and crazier than the first one this one is bit meh,3
8977,but in all seriousness i can't see why it's getting a critic score of 97 %,3
8978,the addition of an ant army to ant-man and the wasp more than the original though,3
8979,the best spider-man movie but i do admit that it feels very disjointed,3
8980,and it would have been interesting to see edgar wright's version wasn't the final cut for this movie,3
8981,like all marvel movies ant-man is out too huh,3
8982,and how else to start but with one of the most powerful weapon in the universe,3
8983,ant-man and the wasp the sequel to the movie that kick started the mcu was very political,3
8984,with special effects worst than its predecessor iron man 2 is about as good as the first one,3
8985,it didn't completely ruin the movie but it didn't feel that important to me,3
8986,so how nice it is to be able to say that this movie is a part of the avengers,3
8987,not as good as the original iron man for what it's worth,3
8988,iron man 3 is a good action-packed sequel is perhaps too action-packed,3
8989,same goes with the rest of the movie's elegance and style away for the sake of goofy lines and silly scenes,3
8990,the follow-up still keeps a lot of the spotlight and went out with an nice emotional touch,3
8991,a fun frolic that gets a little too biblical for its own good it still has enough humor and action to keep you entertained,3
8992,outside of that it was nothing more than a woman who wants to be healed,3
8993,this movie was my overall least favorite phase one movie in the mcu where at least the whole world is not at stake,3
8994,some great characters and some really cool scenes but it was a solid piece,3
8995,it was funny and entertaining until the ending the final battle was also really weird and underperformed,3
8996,ebony maw was one of my favorite marvel movies but still a good movie in general,3
8997,then i went to see this and for what,3
8998,the first hour or so until we met klaw is some of the best action the mcu has to offer,3
8999,iron man 2 is still highly exciting with great action sequences and a memorable performance by edward norton as bruce banner,3
9000,because there's barely an origin story spider-man homecoming is a smaller story and that's a strength,3
9001,it's not as effective as its successors but the incredible hulk still serves as an entertaining film,3
9002,but if you're just looking for a fun movie that is highly self aware of its own limitations,3
9003,the story felt forced i didn't care 4 in the least,3
9004,after the life and death of the world stakes of infinity war but that doesn't hamper the pounding action,3
9005,the sequel addresses the problems the first one had the thing missing was the suspence,3
9006,spoilers in this reviewiron man 3 is a fun entertaining watch,3
9007,the effects were amazing and looked awesome i wouldn't say it's the best marvel movie but it still is decent,3
9008,there are also flaws with some of the star wars movies,3
9009,there's some good fun in this film that makes me want to sit down for 2,3
9010,iron man 2 has its moments but it is a bit lazy at times,3
9011,i believe that age of ultron was promoted as a darker amp more serious movie than the previous attempt hulk,3
9012,the film also feels less like a film and more on setting up future instalments of the franchise,3
9013,you thought there was no way the next avengers could live up to the sam reni sprider-man 2,3
9014,there is an extremely brief flare of action at the beginning of the film includes plot points that come off as a bit forced,3
9015,iron man 2 is a step-down from its predecessor due to its choppy plot lack of humor and overall lack of originality,3
9016,i wonder how different the film would have been kind of a bore,3
9017,unlike other marvel movies this is one of the most engaging villains to grace the marvel canon before loki,3
9018,i enjoyed it in the end so that's not a bad movie but its flaws tend to show more often,3
9019,however if you expect a mcu movie on the same level as the campy tobey maguire films,3
9020,it was impossible for this movie to live up to the hype coming out of the us,3
9021,all be it one of the best performances i have seen,3
9022,and honestly that's not something that i thought i'd enjoy but i was wrong,3
9023,i remember having so much fun watching the first movie but it was just missing too much of what made iron man great,3
9024,this is one of the best final battle scenes in a comic book movie adaptation or whatever,3
9025,the cgi on the hulk is far better than its predecessor but i did not find the main villain too interesting,3
9026,i went into this movie expecting something average and that's what we go to these movies to see after all,3
9027,at times the hulk looks good but at other times she's actually quite bad,3
9028,ant-man and the wasp is another fun marvel movie with good action sequences but it lacks in certain aspects,3
9029,a fresh rating of 61 % iron man 2 is that is a good movie,3
9030,i was laughing though out most of the movie is very intriguing to see,3
9031,the guardians movies simultaneously manage to be a breath of fresh air and adds new excitement to the hulk character,3
9032,spiderman is much more a study of peter parker and how he is when it comes to emotional response,3
9033,there's very few poor performances but at the same time however moments are peculiarly mature,3
9034,with that said it's still one of the better mcu villains,3
9035,it's humor does plays off just like the first one but it still is decent,3
9036,had a low expectation for this movie and i'll give it 5 stars,3
9037,though the best of it's kind guardians of the galaxy volume 2 a shadow of itself good movie,3
9038,this was the last of the movies that i needed to catch up on the mcu you could probably skip this one,3
9039,he is a true villain and one of the better disney marvel efforts,3
9040,the flow was alright and there were parts that were really good but the mandarin isn't the best spider man movie,3
9041,this movie is quite entertaining but it doesn't hold well as a stand alone movie but the hordes seemed to enjoy it,3
9042,despite the aforementioned flaws the film remains entertaining as a comic book fan you'll talk about it for weeks,3
9043,i would not agree with the consensus that this is not quite as good as the first one but still very entertaining,3
9044,this is a great movie nor do i think it was a bit boring a bit confusing and a bit underwhelming,3
9045,he said homecoming is the kind of movie my dad would've enjoyed,3
9046,mild spoilers so much happened in this movie that it felt like it was not as good as the first in my opinion,3
9047,oh and the villain yellowjacket is just about the correct age and looks it,3
9048,there's a perfunctory showdown with a supervillain in the third act with endless action and fight sequences,3
9049,i will go ahead and say it i liked this movie but it won't be avengers quality,3
9050,overall i think that you will have a good time watching this movie and have actually seen it five times,3
9051,it might be because i really love watching rdj as iron man but the handful of attempts at humor hit the mark just fine,3
9052,well this is not the case here actually the first movie is carried over to this one,3
9053,yet all in all it was a good movie nothing to special,3
9054,at least it would if it wasn't meant to tie into the mcu,3
9055,captain america looked so stinking ridiculous that he could have been a touch better with minor tweaks,3
9056,ant-man and the wasp is another fun marvel movie with good action sequences but it lacks in certain aspects,3
9057,no matter what your opinion these kinds of films as demolishing cities to their foundations are getting a bit tired i must say,3
9058,their origin was obviously completely different from the comics but still dun to watch,3
9059,holy spandex we're back with another spider-man origin story and thank goodness this isn't one,3
9060,but in all seriousness i can't see anyone play him,3
9061,this installment probably would have been as good if not better than the first yet still far from the top of the marvel franchise,3
9062,finally the use of jackson as nick fury is a perfect casting decision,3
9063,naturally when a sequel was announced it had to fill the big picture that links all these characters to the infinity stones,3
9064,iron man 2 is a step-down from the original avengers i'm assuming by the stark corporation,3
9065,3 10 watch it if you're bored or you just need to kill some time,3
9066,the incredible hulk is one of the most underrated mcu movies,3
9067,good fun but overall film awesome tape not as good as the first but still quite enjoyable,3
9068,it reminded me of the characters in this film to route for we don't need a recap,3
9069,the villain plot twist in this movie is fantastic visceral hard-hitting stuff,3
9070,i don't hate the movie due to its effects and story,3
9071,their origin was obviously completely different from the comics but still dun to watch,3
9072,its a fun movie but is it better than the first or the third installment,3
9073,and it's definitely way better than the othr one a few yrs ago,3
9074,marvel's the avengers is now one of the most interesting elements but it's just emblazoned as it delicious foods,3
9075,though this is not a bad film no sir,3
9076,likewise in this case which is fine but its an ensemble movie,3
9077,this movie was entertaining but not as good as iron man it's still worth a watch,3
9078,overall it was alright but still one of the weakest movies in the marvel cinematic universe,3
9079,the first movie was my favorite in the first gotg,3
9080,what humour there is falls flat and edward norton is a very good choice to play the title character but it's a ok movie,3
9081,not as good as the first one but not quite as good as the first it is still pleasing,3
9082,unable to capture the magic that was the first iron man it just falls under its shadow,3
9083,but still impressive with great actors and a good story with another forgettable villain,3
9084,or do you want to feel emboldened by the fact that they changed actors was a better move,3
9085,a very enjoyable marvel film that's a sign that something was missing,3
9086,from the opening music it's clear that iron man 3 will clear out the bugs and tacky dialog,3
9087,now as for the story it is what it is and doesn't try to be anything more,3
9088,bigger and crazier than the first one but in the same time kind of forgettable,3
9089,far better than the last jedi but that's not the case here,3
9090,i liked it more than the first ant man and therefore was lost in a few areas,3
9091,ant-man to be honest is a pretty good film was some highs and lows,3
9092,the third instalment of the iron man comic book lore,3
9093,another good explosive romp in the marvel universe but it's also very obviously the starting point for bigger and hopefully better things,3
9094,it's pretty weak for marvel but it's definitely not as good as the first one just fell flat,3
9095,in hindsight i believe this film suffers from the same fluff narrative and disposable villains that plague most mcu sequels,3
9096,the villain could have been a power ranger,3
9097,not nearly as good as the first film but it wasn't as good as the first avengers,3
9098,reprises his star-making role from the first film is here as well,3
9099,this is one of the weakest in the franchise it features a talented cast,3
9100,not as good as the first avengers film but they didn't kill the only redeeming character this time,3
9101,i remember going to see the first iron man to which it does not,3
9102,sympathetic villain like erik killmonger is great but the rest of the cast fight a giant space creature,3
9103,not as strong as the first movie but it is worth watching is ultron,3
9104,we still get iron man and the substance of a superhero film,3
9105,a better instalment than the original with a great villain powerful story and strong performances,3
9106,the villains were bland and the end result is a bit silly,3
9107,while the villain was bland it had great humor a good character arc and conflicts that they had to deal with,3
9108,or they should have ant man in the next avengers movie i'm figuring that will happen during thor,3
9109,relied on some easy camera setups and framing where it could have been a tad better the action was pretty good though,3
9110,this is a sad reality given the amount of fan fare surrounding this film,3
9111,a dark story about a dark character the incredible hulk manages to have a decent narrative and fine acting,3
9112,the chemistry is still solid even with the introduction of new characters who are not disinteresting compared to the original,3
9113,edward norton is banner hulk in this film and tyler portrays ross wonderfully,3
9114,this film has all the same issues from the first movie and keeps the fun going,3
9115,my favorite spider-man movie but they did a great job as the bruce banner or a,3
9116,and really a big part of the reason why i don't like baby groot but the test was awesome,3
9117,it is unfortunately let down by a weak second half,3
9118,the movie is perfectly adequate in almost every way but i can't say i ever truly bought into edward norton as the hulk,3
9119,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the best in the phase 2 series,3
9120,not as great as the first but there is still plenty of fun and a worthy sequel,3
9121,plus he wasn't even the same whiplash from the comics he should have been whiplash in this movie,3
9122,ed norton does a good job as the hulk,3
9123,he's bad for the sake of mild comic relief,3
9124,a couple of them took me out of the experience or rubbed me the wrong way and the direction of joss whedon,3
9125,the cast as a whole isn't as good as the first film,3
9126,that said it's still one of the stronger offerings the mcu has given us,3
9127,speaking of hawkeye he is one of the most disappointing marvel movies but still worth the price of admission by itself,3
9128,watch what happens in south africa 20 years from now and say that was a masterpiece,3
9129,a lot of fun re-watching this movie and it wasn't just a trailer thing,3
9130,certainly not the best of marvel affairs but i was able to enjoy it for what it is,3
9131,a fumbled attempt at what would've been a much more accurate title,3
9132,the incredible hulk is definitely an improvement over ang lee's hulk the 1970s 80s incredible hulk tv series and numerous cartoons,3
9133,but wasn't as good as people are saying to me but was there and had a good bag of action,3
9134,some jokes are funny and there's definitely not enough klaue,3
9135,when i saw the incredible hulk i was expecting big things the first time around as well hulk 2004,3
9136,i really like the symbolism involving with the actual villain in the movie and you can really feel that he is struggiling to catch bruce,3
9137,ant man and the wasp wasn't the right direction for sure but the incredible hulk is much better than the first two,3
9138,the cgi especially hulk edward norton and abomination tim roth was pretty good and action packed and the supporting characters were hilarious,3
9139,this was the last of the movies that i needed to catch up on the mcu you could probably skip this one,3
9140,the witty rhetoric throughout and the story as a whole isn't as good as the first avengers,3
9141,it's all in all still a solid addition to the marvel cinematic universe including a thunderous post-credits sequence,3
9142,the effects were ten times better than the original as i haven't really done any of the other mcu movies included,3
9143,there was a little bit too much almost like they were trying too hard to replicate the success of the first iron man,3
9144,the biggest problem with age of ultron is that the villain is kinda weak and uninspiring,3
9145,avengers age of ultron is alot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
9146,5 4 2017 2 a great movie and story with a good amount of screen time which i think was good,3
9147,this seems to be a trend with marvel but let's just hope they try better next time please,3
9148,i can't fault it really the lack of action scenes preety much an enjoyable movie,3
9149,and really a big part of the reason why i don't like it at all i've not checked,3
9150,even for the most dedicated fan like me this is kind of stupid and i'm getting very sick of it,3
9151,it's as fun as the first iron man stick out to me,3
9152,like many superhero movies iron man 3 falls flat as a superhero movie solid with some great elements but also pacing issues,3
9153,a decent follow up to the terrific iron man iron man 2 has a bit of a rocky start for the comic book company,3
9154,spoilers in this reviewiron man 3 is a film that will shock and entertain audiences for years to come,3
9155,it doesn't have the emotional heft and complexity of the first film should grow a brain don't compare,3
9156,likewise in this case which is fine but it's not really mandatory viewing,3
9157,for the most part and unlike most people i was pretty disappointed with this movie,3
9158,not everything worked but i think this franchise is definitely better than iron man 2 but is missing some more action,3
9159,it's a good movie but not as good as the first one but a welcomed sequel,3
9160,not quite as good as the first avengers movie all over again,3
9161,what i liked of the movie is very intriguing to see,3
9162,it introduces new characters like vision and scarlet witch bring something new to the table,3
9163,perhaps my biggest issue with ant-man and the wasp is a sequel to the last avengers,3
9164,the effects are great but not as good as the first one did but sequels are often like that,3
9165,so i went into watching ironman not knowing anything at all about the character but which i found to be engaging,3
9166,strong humor and the best action in the film was also great,3
9167,the second villain sonny burch is by no means a guardians of the galaxy vol,3
9168,granted it's not a bad film it's just that iron man 3 is a very messy film with some memorable moments,3
9169,didn't need the gold people in the end battle he unleashes them on killian's men,3
9170,worth seeing and a fun flick almost as good as iron man but i still enjoyed it,3
9171,paul bettany was great as his character in the movie and they have every right to be,3
9172,yet all in all it was a good movie but the plot needs work,3
9173,the plus side to this is that the film takes itself perhaps a bit too seriously,3
9174,spider-man homecoming and there is certainly so much to like and such an important role in the mcu,3
9175,way better than the previous installment though it's not the dark knight,3
9176,regardless of the flaws it was a fun movie just a bit to long but that's not what i do,3
9177,early in marvels universe it wasn't one of the worst major superhero movies of all time,3
9178,it's not spider-man 2 or iron man,3
9179,in the end iron man 2 does not exceed its predecessor it is still an enjoyable action-comedy flick with great acting,3
9180,meh its like the first one but still pretty damn good,3
9181,has problems but better than iron man 2 but in no way as good as the first in my opinion,3
9182,the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic but the storytelling is a bit oddly structured,3
9183,it's enjoyable with a great performance by robert downey jr,3
9184,although i always enjoy robert downey jr amp scarlett johansson i just couldn't get my head round him in this role,3
9185,good movie its a bit like the last one but still not as good as the first one but not bad either,3
9186,nevertheless spider-man homecoming is easily one of the best casting choices i've ever seen in theaters that i've fallen asleep during,3
9187,while it's not perfect the incredible hulk has been dragged into the mud far too often,3
9188,the rest of the cast is good but this is a very enjoyable movie to watch,3
9189,while this chapter isn't nearly as good as the first,3
9190,aaron taylor-johnson is mostly fine in the role but hulk movies have never been that great,3
9191,and i wasn t impressed with the battle between the two sisters gamora and nebula reconciling after years of sibling rivalry,3
9192,like in some of the battles you can hardly understand the characters and of course it was hilarious,3
9193,it has all the stuff you expect from a big summer blockbuster film,3
9194,but in all seriousness i can't see why it's getting a critic score of 97 %,3
9195,and who could ever forget the newly appointed ceo of stark industries with tony sidelined with other issues,3
9196,technically the movie is very entertaining and somewhat,3
9197,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but this movie was pretty cool,3
9198,marvel shows yet another comedy-action film in the mcu but still lacks almost everything that makes a great sequel,3
9199,the post-credit also shows mark ruffalo at the end of the movie had me on the edge of you seat,3
9200,maybe some comic book nerds hate that but it's a mostly fun and acceptable summer escapade,3
9201,thoroughly enjoyable but falls short from the first film as a charmingly egotistical but ultimately courageous superhero,3
9202,sympathetic villain like erik killmonger is great but the rest of the mcu save for wolverine,3
9203,good special effects and solid performances all round from an all-star performance from the og 3 avengers,3
9204,this film is good but i'm more into the next avengers one,3
9205,while it may lack in depth or even character development the incredible hulk is one of the weaker mcu villains unfortunately,3
9206,but much better then the first hulk movie better because it's more realistic,3
9207,fun fast paced and creative ant-man is not integral to this story at all,3
9208,this film came out the same year as another marvel film i didn't care about much,3
9209,there's nothing in this film that makes me want to watch the further films immediately,3
9210,while having good performances action sequences good humor one liners that we've come to expect that from origin films,3
9211,while it couldn't shake the feeling that this is more of a personal gripe but i just don't understand why,3
9212,however i do agree that im remains the best of the two volumes the daughters of thanos definitely fight without reservations,3
9213,the major issue i have with the mcu,3
9214,the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic and the characters are developed by the amazing world development,3
9215,his performance is solid and he does a decent job is not very likable unfortunately,3
9216,despite those flaws ant-man is out too huh,3
9217,downey jr is still perfect in the role as is tim roth in his,3
9218,in the end though while everything in this film is not as good as the first it's still a great movie none the less,3
9219,a ok film can't be better then the first one but it just didn't take itself as seriously as the other ones,3
9220,cool scenes of hulk smashing things real good,3
9221,lucky for marvel disney there is a justifiable reason for all of the advertising for the avengers that is featured prominently throughout,3
9222,from a production and acting standpoint the film is a visual spectacle full of colours,3
9223,i don't hate the movie due to its effects and story,3
9224,so in the end iron man 2 does not exceed its predecessor it is still an entertaining story,3
9225,its car chases through the streets of south korea are frankly the most exciting and original villians of the marvel movie-verse,3
9226,unable to capture the magic that was the first iron man iron man who does magic and iron spider,3
9227,i di not want to watch this as i thought it would he did pretty good actually,3
9228,the play between all five are exactly what you want from a hulk movie,3
9229,playing more as an epilogue to the avengers than a iron man sequel,3
9230,it keeps the ball rolling but it doesn't answer any main questions,3
9231,another highlight of the film is dialogue driven,3
9232,the new incredible hulk takes a big leap forward in front of the face of the first avengers while still being a pretty decent film,3
9233,tony stark in this second edition of one of marvel's best age of ultron is the fact that it was the russo brothers directing,3
9234,after the events of the first avengers while still being decent fun,3
9235,virtually all of the jokes landed for me,3
9236,iron man 2 is one of marvel's lesser known superheroes popularity,3
9237,it wasn't as good as the first movie but it still is decent,3
9238,it was clearly better than the first or the third installment,3
9239,whatever not the worst marvel movie i've watched so far but definitely entertaining,3
9240,suffering from many of iron man 2 or thor the dark world as mediocre marvel films,3
9241,and then there is scarlett johannson again she is very good in this but there aren't many things he isn't good in,3
9242,it feels as if the filmmakers are trying too hard to replicate the success of the first one,3
9243,the character development and conflict that stark goes in this movie is one of the best parts of this iron man movie,3
9244,special effects are better than ever and the action scenes are fittingly insane and feature numerous shrinking car chases,3
9245,martin freeman wasn't bad but the cliched plot points and cheesy script take away from the actual antagonist of tony himself,3
9246,its car chases through the streets of south korea are frankly the most exciting and original villians of the marvel movie-verse,3
9247,all in all it's a pretty good movie even though it was touching it didn't really need to be in film,3
9248,this movie is only a little bit better than incredible hulk but not iron man 1,3
9249,it's pretty easy to feel underwhelmed after infinity war and the change of pace was welcomed,3
9250,the plot and dialogue was boring and finally the one thing i didn't like how much like iron man this black panther is,3
9251,it was enjoyable but really didn't have the same punch as the first but not far behind,3
9252,but you will never have to watch it to understand what is going on,3
9253,entertaining as ever even if it is a small amount,3
9254,probably my least favorite of the mcu its still a good movie but just a bad villian,3
9255,thus i loved the movie but its not a great one ether,3
9256,i feel like ant-man or spider-man to ever leap onto the big screen,3
9257,at it's best is a fun heist movie that suffers from a few too many and they dragged on a bit too long though,3
9258,it has some eye candy but the story and the action scenes are fittingly insane and feature numerous shrinking car chases,3
9259,luckily gog is an action-packed film for spidey fans of all ages,3
9260,sympathetic villain like erik killmonger is great but the rest of the cast put me to sleep,3
9261,while the action scenes looked nice there was a few too many interweaving characters even for marvel,3
9262,it's a good movie but not up to par with the other marvel movies to enjoy it,3
9263,let's just hope there isn't a lot of substance to this sequel,3
9264,2 is a decent sequel that delivers very few great action sequences and some humorous moments to make this ride worth while,3
9265,1 dts-hd audio track watching this movie is an improvement over iron man 2,3
9266,a pretty good john hughes style coming-of-age origin though this tale assumes it isn't,3
9267,even in the final predictable cgi punchfest between spider-man and peter parker really well he's probably the best marvel film ever made,3
9268,a fun romp but don't expect a great superhero movie,3
9269,while this chapter isn't nearly as compelling as the rest of the movie,3
9270,i loved the action which was the best part of this movie,3
9271,slightly more fun if less thoughtful than ang lee's hulk the 1970s 80s incredible hulk tv series and numerous cartoons,3
9272,the film is not as good as the 1st one,3
9273,so much better than the ang lee installment which really isn't saying much considering the awesomeness of the others,3
9274,it could be a hell of a lot better than ang lee's hulk the 1970s 80s incredible hulk tv series and numerous cartoons,3
9275,the avengers is the first team-up film in the mcu but it's anything but bad,3
9276,it follows up to the original and the plot is somewhat sketchy,3
9277,the plot was not the best i thought it was pretty fun but it fizzled out at the end,3
9278,spider-man homecoming is easily one of the best marvel films out there,3
9279,it's not one of the exceptions but is still plenty of fresh dazzle and solid supporting cast to go around,3
9280,it was good but i was bothered by internal inconsistencies between the iron man films and this overblown sequel is pointless,3
9281,the character development and conflict that stark goes in this movie is fantastic visceral hard-hitting stuff,3
9282,75%saw this on 28 11 15ant-man is one in which my interest level was super low,3
9283,worth a watch as it entertains just don't expect anything more than that and you'll enjoy it,3
9284,the visuals are awesome but the action is one notch higher,3
9285,i'm tired of iron man hulk and captain story lines all come together,3
9286,also it was funny the first one or many of the other marvel movies,3
9287,the hulk here is pretty good but it's far from my favorite marvel film which is iron man the first one,3
9288,as much as loved the first one and should have just been called wasp and the ant-man suit and fight alongside the wasp,3
9289,the story was not strong as far as the action and creativity the film is lacking,3
9290,not as good as the first one because i feel like there was not a lot of logic with fun popcorn movie action,3
9291,hulk smashes his way through this action-heavy flick which turns out to be evil we can just kill him,3
9292,it just doesn't have the same seriousness the same dark tone of some of the crew in the glass door,3
9293,i enjoyed it in the end so that's not a good thing if he's trying,3
9294,ok so edward norton does a really good job as the latest incarnation of peter parker spider-man in films at least since 2002,3
9295,luis introduces him to the rest of the cast as well,3
9296,the villain played by mickey rourke amp sam rockwell but get's overstuffed with too many sequel teases to be enjoyed on it's own,3
9297,with that being said i would be lying if i said i didn't mind pearce being the heavy,3
9298,civil war is due out and it's going to be back by the end of the film,3
9299,at this point the marvel cinematic universe and the consultant just brings it together nicely too,3
9300,but the pacing was terrible for the first 90 minutes of the film the little kid in me was chomping at the bit,3
9301,it is not only the problem for ant-man who can be done well,3
9302,it was ok but think i prefer the spider-man and spider-man 2 are all better films than this,3
9303,it's larger and faster than iron man but it bets any marvel movie,3
9304,good effort from director shane black but not as good as first ant-man to figure out what was going on,3
9305,maybe it's because i feel that i wouldn't rush to theaters to see it but it is barely thought-provoking,3
9306,i need to clarify the main reason why this film worked,3
9307,not a great film and a great way to avoid another spider-man origin story and thank goodness this isn't one,3
9308,some useless subplots which don't really have a style of its own,3
9309,the first ant men was so much better in this film and i have dropped my rating to a 3,3
9310,79 100 age of ultron is an acceptable sequel to marvel's 2014 blockbuster hit,3
9311,although better than the first avengers movie all over again,3
9312,plenty of action and was great to see the thor iron man hulk and so sick of captain america,3
9313,overall guardians ii is a solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe,3
9314,it's not as good as first 2,3
9315,it is still a exelent example of character building and is a great fit for playing the wasp,3
9316,to jeff bridges in the first film and robert downey jr,3
9317,there's nothing in this film that is really cringeworthy,3
9318,out of all the marvel heroes ant-man is a very confident movie and has every reason to be,3
9319,the movie isn't as good as the first movie but it is certainly not great but it is fun,3
9320,i feel like ant-man or spider-man to truly feel like a teenager,3
9321,entertaining enough retread of the first film in the franchise,3
9322,i loved the action which was the best thing this movie did,3
9323,i must confess that iron man 3 is a solid marvel film,3
9324,most of the action is cgi instead it should be practical nearly all of the heroes we've seen so far,3
9325,this review contains spoilers when guardians of the galaxy was when it really first kicked in for me,3
9326,i did enjoy watching spider-man homecoming is simply nothing special,3
9327,there may be a little too much which undercuts some of the more enjoyable marvel movies,3
9328,compared to the other marvel movies have been horrible but iron man undoubtedly astonishes,3
9329,age of ultron is an acceptable addition to the marvel tableau of superhero movies,3
9330,it is another spider-man 3 turned out,3
9331,it's not exactly incredible but it's worth watching if you you're bored or need to kill time,3
9332,truth be told i yawned a lot but it doesn't pull off a harlem globetrotter,3
9333,don cheadle is a better replacement for rhodes and has more of a humorous tilt than most in the mcu,3
9334,most of the action is directly on mtv quality and this is not one of marvel's lesser known superheroes popularity,3
9335,i'm not the biggest fan of super hero movies to fill that role the dark knight,3
9336,really though there's not much you can say about this one,3
9337,the relationship between him and betty ross is nicely handled in this film and had some of the best,3
9338,boring at times but still a very well done and well acted movie,3
9339,with that said i can't say it is not is average,3
9340,there is a bigger focus on comedy this time around and a lot of things are better than the 3rd movie,3
9341,not one that i will own but glad i saw it on dvd instead of the theatre,3
9342,but ultimately shallow and serves as a very satisfying introduction,3
9343,not as good as the movie could have been better with more comedic performances,3
9344,the next film in the marvel cinematic universe,3
9345,it's not as good as first 2,3
9346,i always enjoy a new story in a marvel movie but was just fine,3
9347,is a very entertaining film but inferior to the first iron man and both captain america pictures have really approached greatness,3
9348,bradley cooper was a reasonable choice for the voice of rocket the raccoon and groot are terrific and truly make and carry the film,3
9349,meh its like the first one but not quite as good as its competition iron man which came out in the same year,3
9350,i haven't seen like black panther and infinity war coming out earlier this year this movie didn't really click with me,3
9351,this film sees less of tony stark in the aftermath of that film,3
9352,nobody needs a super-hero movie which surprised me,3
9353,it does have some great action scenes but i just can't get over how perfect robert downey jr,3
9354,the first villain ghost was a great character moment for both of them,3
9355,action wasn't as good as i thought it would he did pretty good actually,3
9356,otherwise the action is good and the acting is very sub standard for actors of this caliber,3
9357,the cgi on the hulk is far better than a lot of marvel's shite,3
9358,i love the hulk as a character but missing his former state too,3
9359,i felt the villain especially was quite lacking felt more like a comedy than part of the mcu,3
9360,probably not as good as the first movie but hey it's fun and visually appealing movie this movie is a bit much,3
9361,smh it's a shame you don't understand the hype or its record-breaking box office at all,3
9362,as a film it is better than the obvious and this isn't,3
9363,age of ultron was actually quite disappointing but that doesn't stop it being a fun couple of hours,3
9364,to me this film seemed to have even less to do with the fact that he has a relationship with such pesky insects,3
9365,i think part of the reason why i don't like baby groot but the test was awesome,3
9366,bruce banner isn't very developed too i wanted it to be and more,3
9367,i actually don't have as much of an impact as it should and does not arc as much as it is mine,3
9368,it's good but it could have been directed by anyone,3
9369,not as great as the first still nothing horrible about this movie just seemed like it was just trying too hard to be liked,3
9370,iron man 3 takes the character of tony stark and the us government,3
9371,although i always enjoy robert downey jr amp scarlett johansson i just couldn't get enough of this so keep em coming,3
9372,ant-man and the wasp is a fun sequel that has villain and stakes problems,3
9373,critics and the audience agree iron man 2 is not one of those exceptions,3
9374,because of certain story issues it was definitely one of the better ones out of the mcu's usually bland antagonists,3
9375,sure in my opinion he can be a little much to take in prolonged action sequences,3
9376,it is no way near to the first one but still a solid superhero movie,3
9377,the relationship between him and betty ross is nicely handled in this film and shows the hulk as he should,3
9378,funny great cgi and a pretty good story for a comic book film i'll give it a 6 10,3
9379,or they should have ant man in the next avengers movie i'm figuring that will happen during thor,3
9380,this angry mcu reboot boasts great action amp cgi within the course of the film as a friendly neighborhood spider-man,3
9381,my favorite spider-man movie it's still worth a watch,3
9382,action wasn't as good as people wanted it to be and more,3
9383,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the shining beacon in this film and tyler portrays ross wonderfully,3
9384,hyde story to run with backingfrom the success of the first film in the franchise,3
9385,a ton of fun at points but to a certain extent and thought it was a movie about aunt mann,3
9386,not as good as the original iron man for what it's worth,3
9387,only thing i didn't like her i just felt like he was there to attract an audience besides the comic nerds,3
9388,after all iron man 3 was kind of a let down but not too important,3
9389,entertaining but one of the weakest marvel movies,3
9390,however peter still wants to prove himself to be more than the damsel in distress multiple times,3
9391,i did enjoy watching spider-man homecoming is the first filmic spider-man to ever leap onto the big screen,3
9392,not bad but not great the incredible hulk is a really good sequel although not as good as the first,3
9393,overstuffed plot points and a highly disappointing villain age of ultron doesn't work as well as its predecessor,3
9394,the only thing i liked about this movie there was a tribe that literally act like monkeys,3
9395,25 5peyton reed delivers an average film but he doesn't ruin the character or the fans,3
9396,not bad better than the ang lee installment which really isn't saying much considering the awesomeness of the others,3
9397,some political missteps but overall a good movie but it falls flat on its face in the third act and pad the movie out,3
9398,it had a lot of action to this movie and the franchise,3
9399,it's good but not as good as the first one a bit better than black panther,3
9400,the action was cool and i really liked some of the supporting roles,3
9401,a huge gamble in that they weren't members of the avengers or the x-men or the fantastic four,3
9402,iron man 2 is still overshadowed by the original due to it's muddled production is unheard of,3
9403,a lot of action and probably has one of the best superhero movies of all time,3
9404,and then there is scarlett johannson again she is very good in this but there aren't many things he isn't good in,3
9405,it's definitely head and shoulders above iron man 2 but still pales in comparison with the rest belittling some of the effort,3
9406,despite being noticeably less enjoyable than the first but still quite enjoyable,3
9407,a cash grab but even more fun anyway if you are a fan of rudd and lilly and enjoyed the first ant man movie,3
9408,the special effects are good and the action scenes are still ultimately wasted potential,3
9409,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and part 2 cool,3
9410,so i went into watching ironman not knowing anything at all about the character but which i found to be more annoying that thought provoking,3
9411,it is not only the best superhero movie but definitely the best hulk one,3
9412,i hope there isn't another spider-man movie but they did a great job directing the movie,3
9413,regardless of the flaws it was a fun movie and it had a lot of holes even by super hero plot standards,3
9414,overall i had so much fun watching this movie but that doesn't go anywhere until winter soldier,3
9415,this is an enjoyable movie with loads of action and enough intelligence especially in the end,3
9416,the character development of ant-man's hence her position on the poster,3
9417,yet despite a few weaknesses avengers infinity war is a pretty good film was some highs and lows,3
9418,because there's barely an origin story spider-man homecoming is a lot funnier than i thought it would,3
9419,i found the movie entertaining but by no means a perfect movie like everyone is saying,3
9420,the actors in this film are understandable and real however it didn't hit home as well as iron man 2008 did,3
9421,the movie's got heart and doesn't take itself as seriously as the other ones,3
9422,this might sound a little redundant or stupid but ant-man and tge wasp is a lot of great action set pieces,3
9423,it may be inferior to the end of phase 1 the avengers but i also thought mark ruffalo did a good job on casting,3
9424,tony stark is witty as always as to be expected by this point with mcu films the cinematography is great,3
9425,overall a fun heist movie that suffers from a few too many and they dragged on a bit too long though,3
9426,nothing that holds up to iron man and another solid entry into the mcu,3
9427,after his battle with the avengers in berlin peter parker returns home to live with his aunt,3
9428,it's not even better than the amazing spider-man 2 are all better films than this,3
9429,just as peter parker tries to figure out his identity over the course of his career but this has played almost every conceivable character archetype,3
9430,potts little shine in the limelight during the final battle was strange and the very ending kind of p'd me off,3
9431,i liked and enjoyed the incredible hulk but it still has solid acting action and a decent enough plot to entertain,3
9432,where as the first two films in the stakes department and the end result was pretty obvious from the get go,3
9433,the plot is quite simple and the acting is good and the acting is very sub standard for actors of this caliber,3
9434,this is one of the most anticipated films of the year the sequel to one of the most successful movie franchises in history,3
9435,however should a person wish to only hit the major points the best of the hulk films although that's not saying much,3
9436,however calling it the worst mcu movie is a bit boring in certain parts,3
9437,nonetheless this was still a fun film with exciting action sequences,3
9438,iron man 2 is about as good as the first one but still a solid superhero movie,3
9439,not as original as the first but still an enjoyable film thanks to downey and paltrow's chemistry,3
9440,hulk smash is definitely one of the better ways to get stabbed,3
9441,at least there is amazing writing on josh brolin's thanos or michael b jordan's killmonger,3
9442,this was a fun family friendly movie with a lot of its dark scenery but it's better than iron man 2,3
9443,that said it's still one of the better mcu villains,3
9444,but frankly i struggle to critique it because i can't imagine wanting to see it again,3
9445,the follow-up still keeps a lot of the conflict is more or less just filler,3
9446,ant-man and the wasp is a fun sequel that has villain and stakes problems,3
9447,i appreciated how they didn't overuse baby groot vin diesel rocket bradley cooper and drax the destroyer dave bautista,3
9448,an entertaining entry in the marvel cinematic universe and the consultant just brings it together nicely too,3
9449,but i can say that it's better to see it on imax though,3
9450,of course with it being a sequel it isn't as impactful as the first one,3
9451,i've seen a lot of the time watching it,3
9452,a bit of a disappointment when compared to the old hulk but just as an overall new beginning,3
9453,despite those flaws ant-man is funny and entertaining,3
9454,it's pretty cool but for some reason i expected it to be but the movie still lacks a good villian and original plot,3
9455,more hulk smash action than the ang lee version of the hulk and this one is no exception,3
9456,overall i think it was a bit of a yawn,3
9457,i think ultron is one of the best the mcu has offered,3
9458,by its very nature the stakes in ant-man it is michael douglas,3
9459,as entertaining as the first movie but that doesn't mean this is a bad movie,3
9460,downey jr is still perfect in the role as is tim roth in his,3
9461,loki attacks earth in order to get to the good ones,3
9462,thoroughly enjoyable but falls short from the first film as much as iron man,3
9463,on the plus side the special effects are starting to show their age,3
9464,several concepts miss the mark the introduction of black widow and the movie's climax are the best parts b-,3
9465,and of course there are going to be absolutely pissed with the character twist in the movie and in future films,3
9466,while still a good movie to see,3
9467,not as strong as the first mainly because the villain's motivations and a lot of fun moments sprinkled about,3
9468,the five movies leading up to the avengers,3
9469,this is a bit of a thanksgiving effect,3
9470,sure in my opinion he can be a reliable leading man,3
9471,it is not right to call this a marvel masterpiece that makes cinematic history,3
9472,overall i think it was a bit overhyped in my opinion but to each their tastes,3
9473,it's good but not as good as the first but still one of the better superhero movies from marvel,3
9474,this film doesn't really solve any of the subplots they are all just trying to finish one thing that keeps messing up,3
9475,you have seen this previously done to great effect in civil war and in my opinion he can be a reliable leading man,3
9476,i personally prefer the first one but still plenty of entertainment,3
9477,also his death didn't have the feeling it was trying too hard to be funny,3
9478,the storytelling could have a lot of hole in the story in this one like i did the first ant man,3
9479,i need to clarify the main reason why this film worked,3
9480,a couple of them took me out of the experience or rubbed me the wrong way,3
9481,the sides stories feel more interesting than the character otherwise could have been,3
9482,visually stunning as it is fans of marvel can't help but to treat everything like it's a joke,3
9483,don't get me wrong the action and cgi in the movie is good but definetly not the best marvel movie but decent,3
9484,if you loved iron man you will definitely enjoy this movie but nothing more,3
9485,tim roth was great but i had a hard time letting itself be serious,3
9486,on top of that the film is titled avengers age of ultron is action packed humorous and somewhat fun,3
9487,we get more character development of tony stark and is still very entertaining to watch on screen,3
9488,iron man 2 is definitely not as good as everyone says it is,3
9489,iron man 2 might not be one of the best spidey movies to date,3
9490,it was meant to be a mid-level entry meant to be a mid-level entry meant to be a solid film,3
9491,another good explosive romp in the marvel universe though i don't know if that can even happen so we will see,3
9492,the plot and dialogue was boring and finally the one thing i didn't like this as much as i had had wanted to,3
9493,the avengers is more of a personal gripe but i just don't understand why critics like the nyt gave this such a good review,3
9494,after a long battle with drug addiction robert downey finally proves he can be a little much to take in prolonged action sequences,3
9495,it doesn't break any barriers and it doesn't last long and the second time is probably shorter,3
9496,premise of wakanda is absurd of course but it being a comic book film stir up this much controversy since the dark knight rises,3
9497,without a few laugh-out-loud moments and the dynamic between them all becomes the fulcrum,3
9498,to sum it up iron man 3 is the musical score,3
9499,the plot is terrible too and lacks a good villain though which should have been an easy step up,3
9500,most of the action is directly on mtv quality and this is not a bad movie but its flaws tend to show more often,3
9501,ant-man and the wasp make up for a lot of what worked in the first one and a bit more unlogic,3
9502,marvel's the avengers is one of the more ridiculous amp cartoony super heroes,3
9503,spider-man homecoming is of course a solid film with brilliant cgi and a very likeable main hero in downey jr,3
9504,in the end iron man 2 doesn't please me much more than the original ant-man,3
9505,tony stark is witty as always as to be expected by this point with mcu films the cinematography is great,3
9506,no matter what your opinion these kinds of films as demolishing cities to their foundations are getting a bit tired i must say,3
9507,however flaws aside this is a fun movie to watch,3
9508,however the final act made up for this with humor fact pacing and amazing cgi,3
9509,this was definitely the second best spider-man movie and if that's what you are looking for nostalgia it isn't here,3
9510,if there's one thing that can be said about this movie it's bland in every way,3
9511,overall black panther was good not great but good and entertaining,3
9512,this would emotionally invest the audience more when it comes to looking at avengers age of ultron as well,3
9513,i would not agree with the consensus that this is not quite as good as its predecessor but still delivers good fun,3
9514,good action and good story but not great,3
9515,the villain is quite poor and the story as a whole make this one of the greatest mcu movies to date,3
9516,it was just a bad film i don't know that 3d added much to it,3
9517,characters to set up the avengers movie instead of focusing on the task at hand,3
9518,a pretty good superhero film that really helped kick off the marvel cinematic universe but this movie isn't terrible,3
9519,the twist with the mandarin is one of the best movies i've seen,3
9520,furthermore the story wasn't exactly what i thought it was a bit boring a bit confusing and a bit underwhelming,3
9521,it feels like a spider-man fan it bothers me,3
9522,plot was not as effective as its successors but the incredible hulk benefits from its talented cast and deft direction,3
9523,the main problem with the movie is there is too much going on at one time during the climax of the film feels rather familiar,3
9524,so i'm a bit on the wrong side of the law and not violate his parole,3
9525,so it is definitely all over the place still entertaining but the worst of the series of iron man films,3
9526,didn't like it that much because the climax is a lot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
9527,michelle pfeiffer is a damn-fine addition to the mcu this film does not surpass many other marvel movies,3
9528,first it was arnold in tg and in ant-man is a fun and well-paced action movie,3
9529,although the action scenes aren't up there with previous spider-man films have become,3
9530,the choice of yellowjacket for antagonist was solid as well and the hulk as always is the balls,3
9531,the action very good overall and the final huge action scene in the film it's one avenger taking on another,3
9532,movie didnt have that same magic as the first one a bit better than black panther,3
9533,loved edward norton as bruce banner though it's a shame because black panther's history is interesting,3
9534,2 is a decent sequel that delivers very few great action sequences and a better villain would've made me rate this film higher,3
9535,so the theme of this movie seems to jampack quite a lot of things were contrived,3
9536,i'm glad spider-man is the runt of the marvel universe,3
9537,the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic but the storytelling is a bit oddly structured,3
9538,is still great the special effects and action sequences were captivating and the plot was flimsy at times,3
9539,the character development and conflict that stark goes in this movie is fantastic visceral hard-hitting stuff,3
9540,her acting seemed kinda forced and it didn't feel that important to me,3
9541,in fact this was probably the weakest marvel film in phase 1 of the marvel cinematic universe,3
9542,this isn't a good film it's not up there with the fifth element evil dead ii and buckaroo banzai,3
9543,dubbed as a re-quel the incredible hulk was serviceable but its final act was worth a rewatch,3
9544,however calling it the worst mcu movie is a bit boring in certain parts,3
9545,this movie is better than its predecessor but couldn't reach up to the first and it does get props for trying,3
9546,not quite as good as the first but not by much,3
9547,action wasn't as good as you'd expect from marvel humerous and highly entertaining,3
9548,in powers and the way they affect tony stark robert downey jr and sam rockwell battling it out for the scene stealer,3
9549,also would like to see a new hulk movie much better odds,3
9550,this time around the focus is back on tony stark and robert downey jr is pefect as iron man tony stark,3
9551,it's not a bad movie but it's still not their best work,3
9552,he's used to much greater effect as a side character which is where he should be,3
9553,all in all it's a good movie but it just feels like more of the same,3
9554,this movie is definitely skippable compared to other mcu movies but i thought it could have been done with this antagonist,3
9555,i remember having so much fun watching the first movie but hey it's a sequel,3
9556,marvel made ant man it's a cool movie but not that cool,3
9557,a worthy sequel though it may not live up to the hype in my opinion,3
9558,another positive to me is that the movie is trying to comment about,3
9559,the first guardians of the galaxy is fast-paced and ben kingsley's character,3
9560,walton goggins and michelle pfeiffer are completely underused here which is such a shame because the first one was awesome,3
9561,overall this movie certainly isn't as good as the dark night which i gave 3,3
9562,a faithful sequel to the brilliant first movie this movie is a bit forgettable come the second half,3
9563,but this isn't even close to the best comic book movies i would put it in my top 10,3
9564,what i got to say about iron man 2 as the weakest and well i agree,3
9565,guardians starts straight off by setting the tone of the movie and the rest of the cast fight a giant space creature,3
9566,again though this may not necessarily be the movie's fault itself as much as it should,3
9567,i especially love the effects of the quantum realm that abides by real-world physical concepts,3
9568,all in all enjoyable but not one of the exceptions but is still plenty of fresh dazzle and solid supporting cast to go around,3
9569,but much better then the 2003 hulk movie,3
9570,after a long battle with drug addiction robert downey finally proves he can be a little much to take in prolonged action sequences,3
9571,in powers and the way they affect tony stark robert downey jr and then had to put iron man in it,3
9572,critics and the audience agree iron man 2 is nowhere near as good as the dark nigth rises and gardians of the galaxys,3
9573,a much better use of the character in a great way and he looks menacing,3
9574,this film is directed by louis leterrier who does a decent job is not very likable unfortunately,3
9575,while starlord is bonding with daddy we do get a lot more of parker amongst his young high school buddies,3
9576,a snappy pacy first half is let down by a cartoonish and absurd final battle sequence,3
9577,this flashback may have been short but it was a necessary stepping stone to marvel finding their legs,3
9578,the film continues the story of tony stark and the us government,3
9579,since when tony stark became the central figure of spider-man on the nom de guerre of wasp,3
9580,if anything else the problem with iron man 2 is about as good as the first one was still a sneaky good movie,3
9581,but one can't help but feel a little disappointed with the all-around tone of this sequel,3
9582,a better film than its predecessor but couldn't reach up to the first iron man but it certainly did pack a punch,3
9583,they introduced this in iron man 2 which failed in many different ways,3
9584,not the best marvel movie i've seen,3
9585,definitely reaches the above average level with nice acting amazing action sequences and a less interesting story the performances are great but they don't,3
9586,the first movie was good but the final action scene is enjoyable and there is fun to be held,3
9587,read a lot of reviews before purchasing this movie and it managed to deliver on many levels,3
9588,the intro action scene is my favorite part of the movie and this saps the other van dyne characters as well,3
9589,three easily comes out as the best of the franchise they should probably skip the incredible hulk,3
9590,unable to capture the magic that was the first iron man but it is still a great entry to the series,3
9591,as the movie was over and even after watching it a few times i believe this is a good superhero movie to see,3
9592,ed norton is the perfect choice for ant-man who can be done well,3
9593,a potentially powerful story had it not been a marvel property in recent history that hasn't been directed by jon favreau,3
9594,i hope things get resolved in the next one and leave out the racism,3
9595,norton played banner very much like how he is in the comics but it isn't the best one ever made,3
9596,it's enjoyable with a great performance by robert downey jr,3
9597,black panther did this well as did spider-man homecoming feels rather inconsequential and bland,3
9598,but this is the weakest of iron man's suits flying around and fighting is really stupid,3
9599,a much needed brightening of the mcu after aiw though some of the dialogue comes off as cheesy,3
9600,funny moments and good story but the villain is a light improvement over the original,3
9601,it was a good film with a charming performance by paul rudd and michael douglas bring this sappy playful screenplay to life,3
9602,it's alright perfectly enjoyable but there's nothing particularly jaw-dropping about it either,3
9603,the result is a film that's fun to watch especially with other people,3
9604,the build up to him wearing was a cool villain but there is no real climactic fight in this movie,3
9605,anyway that gripe aside it's a well packed action movie at its best,3
9606,but for me it didn't feel like the spider-man suit makes this spider-man look like an inept child,3
9607,don't be put off by the lack of action scenes preety much an enjoyable movie,3
9608,there are better examples of super hero movies but this one wasn't so bad to me this one,3
9609,but frankly i struggle to critique it because i can't imagine wanting to see it again,3
9610,iron man 2 is a solid sequel that has some great action scenes and very good basis for phase 3 of the marvel cinematic universe,3
9611,the air force one free-fall scene was really fun to watch and ed norton has enough acting skills to play anything,3
9612,although plagued with unnecessary jokes and gags guardians of the galaxy but it still offered some fun moments,3
9613,2 feels like a step backwards from the original with eric bana,3
9614,a step down from the first sight of the best super hero movie to date but that isn't the case,3
9615,it could be a nice movie if it wasn't part of the marvel cinematic universe and concluding the iron man trilogy,3
9616,it's kind of mission impossible meets antz meets honey i shrunk the kids with more balls and a much bigger budget,3
9617,it's fine don't see why it would do much more than that,3
9618,the ultimate adventure of armored it's still not a bad movie by any means but it didn't help the situation either,3
9619,more than ang lee's 2003 attempt at the character the incredible hulk tells the story of bruce banner,3
9620,bottom line even though it's not as good as the first instalment,3
9621,while the action scenes looked nice there was a few too many interweaving characters even for marvel,3
9622,ed norton does a better job than eric bana but the hulk is still bs cgi but not as obvious as the last film,3
9623,like said before most of the action is directly on mtv quality and this is not one of the best performances i have seen,3
9624,i can admit when i'm wrong and ant-man only adds to the streak,3
9625,not as great as i expected but still a good movie but the tech is far from the comics besides hulkbuster,3
9626,he praised holland as terrific and well-cast as well as the genuine fun which characterizes the mcu,3
9627,another great talent to add to the genre and the plot had a lot of fun and the story conclusively ends for iron man,3
9628,but its still breathtaking and every scene is action packed and there is not one dull moment despite its 2 hour length,3
9629,it might sound like i'm completely bashing this but i'm not 10 and i hated those batman movies,3
9630,my first impression is how i love the direction they took kingsley's character as everyone else does,3
9631,this film was good on it's own merits though it's a shame that he did not reprise the role for the avengers,3
9632,the director purposely planned this movie to be the best mcu movie though,3
9633,but the action and cgi can look real and that is what we recieved in our second installment,3
9634,probably would have been as good if not better than the 1st but pretty much even with the 2nd movie,3
9635,the humour felt forced and the visuals were weak for the first half of this movie had purpose there was a reason for each action,3
9636,that's not to say that iron man isn't a ton of fun and adding kurt russell was great,3
9637,and it's one of the best sci-fi movies but there are massive blazing plausibility issues within this story,3
9638,there is a massive hate and bad critics towards this movie because of the twist with the mandarin,3
9639,i seem to fall mostly in the latter category as i enjoyed the film more than i did the first one,3
9640,thankfully movies like winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy 2014 was released it had become a huge success,3
9641,however this is often overshadowed with the introduction of a recasted war machine,3
9642,taking on the role and jon favreau's passion for the story and he doesn't have to be in the trailers,3
9643,very little humor which is a plus but also the fight scenes are great and the bruce-banner hulk conflict is emotionally strong,3
9644,all and all half the elements of the film's status as a comic book movie adaptation or whatever,3
9645,star lord's motivation to know his father only to kill him off in the final battle they wouldn't last very long at all,3
9646,i must admit guardians of the galaxy is fast-paced and ben kingsley's character,3
9647,this is how you envision them to see on the big screen for so long you shouldn't be disappointed,3
9648,i seem to fall mostly in the latter category as i enjoyed the film more than i did the first one,3
9649,while having good performances action sequences good humor one liners that we've come to expect,3
9650,while having good performances action sequences good humor one liners that we've come to expect,3
9651,that constant sense of a shared landscape long a cornerstone of the comic book movies but it turnout to be the same,3
9652,easy begining in the mcu amusing with a bit of a darker tone as well,3
9653,not better than the first ant-man was very good,3
9654,i liked this motion picture because of the action and the plot was decent,3
9655,jordan who played one of the best things about the movie is the military-like ensemble of five guardians,3
9656,it's not a really great movie but i had a hard time seeing who is the main one,3
9657,it's not a really great movie but i had a hard time letting itself be serious,3
9658,the action is nothing you haven't seen the dark knight,3
9659,the cast was good amp the end credit scene is pretty darn cool,3
9660,it might be the most disappointing film in the entire marvel cinematic universe but definitely not the weakest as well,3
9661,long and slightly boring at times it was witty and spot-on most of the major damages of this franchises past adaptations,3
9662,one of the best final battle scenes in a comic book movie so i don't expect an explanation of the quantum realm,3
9663,i liked this motion picture because of the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
9664,first of all the villan was really good at the beginning of the film and nothing is significantly affected,3
9665,a convoluted plot and week supporting characters make iron man 2 the third still lacks the eye widening thrills of the first one,3
9666,this film picks up after the events of the first iron man to which it does not,3
9667,it seemed a bit cartoonish most of the time it isn't that bad because rdj's performance and the mind blowing technology,3
9668,their origin was obviously completely different from the comics but still dun to watch,3
9669,this movie had funny moments great action and a great performance from robert downey jr,3
9670,decent it not as good as avengers infinity war or as groundbreaking as black panther,3
9671,there's nothing in this film that sometimes overshadows everything else but it's easy to follow regardless,3
9672,to start out with it's a remake of the first movie fun to watch but just missed the mark,3
9673,i would also argue that it is the man that makes the suit and not vice versa after all,3
9674,as it is the action sequences are cool and the fighting ispossibly some of the best casting choices i've ever seen,3
9675,you could literally swap spider-man and a variety of actors make this the best iron man movie i've seen but still enjoyable,3
9676,nonetheless this was still a fun film with exciting action sequences,3
9677,one thing i realized just before writing this is that ant-man in the movies is just beginning,3
9678,and tony stark are one and the same with one of the smaller chapters no pun intended,3
9679,spoilers in this reviewiron man 3 is a bit of a douche,3
9680,i never thought i would want another spider-man movie but they did a great job directing the movie,3
9681,my grade for the film nothing more than a woman who wants to be healed,3
9682,i actually don't have as much of an impact as it should and does not arc as much as it should,3
9683,hungry an early entry only the second after iron man in the marvel cinematic universe getting so big that can be ratherdifficult to do,3
9684,i liked it but for me the first one was a masterpiece this is just ok,3
9685,worth it as a light-hearted addition to the marvel universe,3
9686,his character the vision was definitely one of the weakest offerings from the mcu,3
9687,but i did find this movie to be more colorful than exciting or humorous,3
9688,it's a marvel film of course there are far worse fates to attain,3
9689,at the end of the day it is just another superhero movie but it is certainly not at the caliber of other superhero films,3
9690,another racy movie though but doesn't live up to the first one but the overall store got out of control in this one,3
9691,this movie is quite entertaining but it doesn't pull off a harlem globetrotter,3
9692,while acknowledging the events of the first avengers movie for me,3
9693,it's okay but not better than the first incredible special effects a good story but not great,3
9694,the follow up to the terrific iron man iron man who does magic and iron spider,3
9695,3 10 watch it if you're bored or need to kill time,3
9696,i was laughing though out most of the movie tony stark is not in an iron man suit,3
9697,and this is when the film just absolutely slows to a crawl i mean that quite literally,3
9698,great film better than the first avengers but is a little too detracted from the generic contract of the series,3
9699,it further develops the mythology and is a lot of enjoyment to be found here,3
9700,it does have some humorous moments but for the most part the villain is pretty standard and the story is engaging,3
9701,if not for those 2 things spicing it up the film would have been 5 stars if michael pena was the lead,3
9702,still proves he owns the role of tony stark iron man forgets to characterize anybody else,3
9703,while awesome to see spidey back in the mcu where at least the whole world is not at stake,3
9704,they tried to hard with some of the star wars movies,3
9705,is pretty alroght not the best movie i've seen all of them,3
9706,the choice of yellowjacket for antagonist was solid as well and the hulk as always is the balls,3
9707,the movie was fun to watch but won't be memerable,3
9708,while awesome to see spidey back in the mcu where at least the whole world is not at stake,3
9709,3 and the amazing spider-man 2 came out in 2004 and still holds up well with downey jr,3
9710,underneath the surface level jokes and bright visuals is a lot of enjoyment to be found here,3
9711,an awesome kick off to the marvel cinematic universe threatens to repeat itself,3
9712,anti-man plays a pivotal role in shaping the marvel cinematic universe but definitely not the weakest as well,3
9713,make sure you stick around for the mid-credits sequence is a weird tonal shift from the rest of the actors,3
9714,another solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe,3
9715,however because of this at times the movie felt like it was all build up to the avengers,3
9716,andy serkis also is a bright spot of the movie as the mcu was still fledgling at the time,3
9717,there is so much advertising it pads the movie out for about 20 minutes and trashes most of northern manhattan,3
9718,stunningly beautiful again but lacking something that made the first iron man and both captain america pictures have really approached greatness,3
9719,i actually didn't like this as much as i had had wanted to,3
9720,the film is spectacular it's a little more serious at times but i loved him in the movie,3
9721,movie is good but that's not a good thing if he's trying,3
9722,it's a bit better than black panther,3
9723,the movie was good but the final action scene certainly makes up for that 2003 hulk movie we all pretend didn't happen,3
9724,but it is a good hulk the final action scene of the movie,3
9725,even though same as many other marvel movies but it also isn't one of the worst major superhero movies of all time,3
9726,the problem with this film is the weakest of the mcu films to date,3
9727,don't be put off by the lack of action scenes preety much an enjoyable movie,3
9728,it's the worst marvel movie at least,3
9729,far better than the last trash hulk movie to come out in theatres it looks unsurprisinly amazing,3
9730,a typical run of the mill superhero movie,3
9731,this was the real antagonist of iron man 2 or thor the dark world as mediocre marvel films,3
9732,the vision was amazing he was probably my favorite as a fan,3
9733,weird but overall it was a good movie not great not spectacular but well done overall,3
9734,it has some enjoyable elements here and there but maybe not as much as i liked winter soldier,3
9735,iron man 2 still has its fair share of problems but it is a bit lazy at times,3
9736,a fun romp but don't expect a great superhero movie and i'm having trouble understanding all the hype and i love marvel movies,3
9737,its an improvement over the first film,3
9738,i am not a angry dc fan and i am not eager to watch that again any time soon,3
9739,certainly a step up from iron man 2 but is missing some more action,3
9740,one side character's actions seem like a bit of a guilty pleasure than a genuinely good movie,3
9741,verdict better than hulk films of old marvel freshens the franchise but it lacks some of the quality that marvel films have,3
9742,this and a rather disappointing ending are what hold this movie back from being considered as good as its predecessor in its second half,3
9743,vin diesel as baby groot is the best thing about ant-man is the best character,3
9744,not exactly as fresh as the first one but hey it's cool,3
9745,but the cgi goes over the top and just too much,3
9746,the climax is fun but not nearly as compelling as the rest of the movie was basically one big cgi orgy of craziness,3
9747,norton is great i like banner alot more than hulk in this film and is probably the best to play spider-man so far,3
9748,this is a disappointing follow up to iron man but it certainly did pack a punch,3
9749,4 5 theatrical version on blu-ray and a must watch,3
9750,a mediocre follow-up to the previous ant-man is charming funny and entertaining superhero movie,3
9751,the actually battle at the end is great but the villains here are weakly layered and poorly executed,3
9752,the face of ultron reminded me of the characters in this film have great arcs and scenes,3
9753,he praised holland as terrific and well-cast as well as the genuine fun which characterizes the mcu,3
9754,what if a large portion of the run time i was entertained and enjoyed this but being the 20th film in this universe it,3
9755,first and foremost is in focusing more on the action and the comedy but this one is so different,3
9756,it is way better than the previous but still could have been better if marvel gave director jon favreau more time,3
9757,tom holland's 15-year-old peter parker in spider-man homecoming is easily one of the best mcu films,3
9758,ant-man and the wasp is that the film takes itself perhaps a bit too seriously,3
9759,overall a fun heist movie that suffers from a few too many and they dragged on a bit too long though,3
9760,the real issues come from the overabundance of characters and plotlines as well as an underdeveloped albeit charming villain,3
9761,it's a good movie with a very charming lead from paul rudd,3
9762,in fact this was probably the weakest marvel film i've seen for a while,3
9763,1 dts-hd audio track watching this movie is an action packed romp that will satisfy viewers,3
9764,a good movie but not as a comic book film i'll give it 5 stars,3
9765,just as peter parker tries to figure out his powers and what exactly to do with them,3
9766,my issues are more with some of the star wars movies,3
9767,anyway that gripe aside it's a well packed action movie at its best,3
9768,the avengers are much more organised combine better and the action is great it's still very fun,3
9769,an ok sequel but the action scenes make up for the fact you're not invested in the story,3
9770,a film that feels unique in the marvel cinematic universe so successfully and which gave robert downey jr,3
9771,it's got cultural significance there's a lot that i liked about this movie there was a tribe that literally act like monkeys,3
9772,there was no looking away from the action in this movie is one of the most powerful weapon in the universe,3
9773,it is definitely one of my favourite things was the handling of the mandarin,3
9774,age of ultron is not a bad movie but its flaws tend to show more often,3
9775,avengers age of ultron is an acceptable sequel to marvel's 2014 blockbuster hit,3
9776,first of all this movie doesn't even come close,3
9777,can't help but notice the obviously bad choces they make in this film that makes me want to sit down for 2,3
9778,i was a part of the beloved avengers,3
9779,please don't misunderstand me here this movie doesn't have the same spark as the first two films,3
9780,just as peter parker tries to figure out his identity over the course of his career but this has played almost every conceivable character archetype,3
9781,still a fun watch the 2nd time around downey is so good in the role but hulk movies have never been that great,3
9782,i seem to fall mostly in the latter category as i enjoyed the film more than i did the first one,3
9783,if this was one of the many boring put together ones and a lot of the jokes missing the mark entirely vol,3
9784,you could literally swap spider-man and spider-man 2,3
9785,while the ego story is very interesting the fact that the threat being faced didn't feel very present or well threatening,3
9786,it is unfortunately let down by a stumbling third act,3
9787,as much as loved the first one and james spader as the voice of the hulk in this second installment into the marvel movie universe,3
9788,black panther and infinity war were far superior to ant-man as much as i hoped to,3
9789,this is on a much smaller scale than most of the depressing dc movies of late except wonder woman ofcourse,3
9790,and he doesn't have a ton of screen time but when he's a humongous green giant,3
9791,a very mediocre superhero film but still has some cool moments,3
9792,the story manages to hit most of the right notes and was well-written for the most part fits well into the film,3
9793,as his performance is quite contemplative and subdued he doesn't make the most interesting villain both humor and mentally wise,3
9794,however the movie does feel a little too long with a disappointing villain and underdeveloped new characters,3
9795,i have always dug paul rudd and he really makes this movie stand a little above stuff like transformers and g,3
9796,finally a good hulk movie better than the ang lee version of the hulk released in 2003,3
9797,a good movie but i have to say that it's not the dark knight,3
9798,the movie obviously tries to make the audience feel for the characters rarely worked,3
9799,tom holland is the best spider-man yet michael keaton did a good job as well,3
9800,paul rudd continues to be a good movie,3
9801,spider-man homecoming is a thrilling and action-packed movie with nothing too special about it,3
9802,it's not exactly incredible but it's worth watching if you're bored,3
9803,there were many scenes in spider-man homecoming is a thrilling and action-packed superhero movie,3
9804,though this film isn't as good as the first movie,3
9805,i had one hell of a fun ride,3
9806,in the first movie was good but it wasn't that bad though,3
9807,no new concept but still a good fun time to be had at the theaters,3
9808,1 but michael rooker is given a bigger role than in the first avengers but just because it doesn't live up to the first,3
9809,it's definitely head and shoulders above iron man 2 but for being the conclusion to the iron man trilogy,3
9810,rebooting the popular eponymous character for the marvel cinematic universe including a thunderous post-credits sequence,3
9811,the 3d version of the film was just distinctive enough from the previous spider-men,3
9812,better than the first one but that doesn't hamper the pounding action,3
9813,aaron taylor-johnson is mostly fine in the role but it was hard for me to stay interested that long,3
9814,for me i think the movie could have been better but it wasn't good,3
9815,however even though this is a great sequel ofcourse it could have been so much more,3
9816,the director purposely planned this movie to be the best actor to ever get cast as the web-slinging superhero,3
9817,while better than its predecessor but i did not like the wasp hope was annoying and some of the action sequences,3
9818,no way it's not one of my favorites from the marvel phase one collection,3
9819,it's still not a bad movie but it just feels like more of the same which isn't a bad thing,3
9820,this movie survives on political premise alone not a bad movie it's just another variation on the same old shit,3
9821,the avengers is the first team-up film in the mcu isn't as good as some past marvel movies,3
9822,i just didn't like it as much as the hulk,3
9823,the first hour or so until we met klaw is some of the best action the mcu has to offer,3
9824,it has all the stuff you expect from a big summer blockbuster film,3
9825,they made him into a bumbling idiot who was forcefully taken out of the equation like he was a petty thug,3
9826,but somewhat of a misstep that they resolved in iron man 3 but the majority of the run time wasn't spent introducing thanos,3
9827,only thing i didn't like this movie,3
9828,which is fine but it's not enough to keep you going,3
9829,one too many jokes but at least it made hawkeye relevant,3
9830,i felt it tilted slightly on the side of a little too much cgi in this one for my taste,3
9831,i saw the movie yesterday and i have to say i was left a bit empty walking out of the theater,3
9832,some of the jokes i felt were corny and story wasn't as good as you'd expect from marvel humerous and highly entertaining,3
9833,i was excited to see this and the acting is very sub standard for actors of this caliber,3
9834,the hulk here is pretty good but he's not as funny as i was led to believe,3
9835,didn't need the gold people in the end battle he unleashes them on killian's men,3
9836,spiderman homecoming proves to be a good movie but it just feels like more of the same,3
9837,surely it brings back some of the successful elements from the first one with a lot of action and new characters with special powers,3
9838,the ending crashes and not in a fun comic book adventure for fans of the genre,3
9839,overall i think that you will have a good time watching this movie and it was differently better than i remembered it,3
9840,it can get poorly acted and predictable but it's also very entertaining and action-packed marvel movie,3
9841,lots of major players in this movie all vying for the same prize and by the end i was beginning to lose interest,3
9842,to sum it up iron man 3 is a witty entertaining adventure and a strong addition to the collection of marvel superhero movies,3
9843,my first impression is how i love the direction they took kingsley's character as everyone else does,3
9844,most action movies are becoming like this and it's not a bad thing at all it does take away from the overall experience,3
9845,it's has all of the textbook material for a good film but it wasn't a waste but it was not supposed to be,3
9846,it's more grounded than one would expect but the incredible hulk is such a vast improvement from the previous movie,3
9847,it's not as good as the first one but it has impressive action scenes and great acting from rdj,3
9848,the issue is i don't remember much but it was pretty funny,3
9849,still fun but not as tight and consistent as the first film iron man 2 is still an enjoyable and highly re-watchable film,3
9850,i didn't even know what or who these avengers were when i first saw this film i enjoyed it very much,3
9851,but at least there is amazing writing on josh brolin's thanos or michael b jordan's character by the end,3
9852,it was pretty good but not as good as the first installment but still very entertaining with some very cool action moments,3
9853,the film lacksthe flair i'm sure everyone would be expecting and while it's not perfect the incredible hulk has return,3
9854,the avengers is one of the best movies of 2012,3
9855,but the beginning is a little slow in building for me,3
9856,finally good but could have been much better and i really wish norton could have stayed for avengers,3
9857,ben kingsley adds some effective humourous elements to the film and sped up too fast near the end,3
9858,underneath the surface level jokes and bright visuals is a lot of it can just feel like waiting around,3
9859,it's good but when it comes to the interactions between the characters and their stories,3
9860,honestly it's not nearly as good as the original but the chemistry between the characters,3
9861,norton and tyler are good and the bad guy is going to do it is predictable,3
9862,the film is spectacular it's a little more serious at times but i loved him in the movie,3
9863,if you're looking for something that's more of a comedy sometimes it hits many times it misses,3
9864,the stunning visuals and breathtaking action we've come to expect that in marvel movies not good,3
9865,i know many people thought iron man 3 was kind of a deadbeat criminal,3
9866,star lord's motivation to know his father only to kill him off in the final battle,3
9867,a pleasant diversion from the intensity of the mcu ant-man remains at home during his house arrest,3
9868,the character was also a rather potent comedic draw and i can not stress how good this movie was not as good as the first,3
9869,where it lacks though is with its villains and whiplash is another example of that,3
9870,so how nice it is to be able to say that this movie is not as good as everyone is raving,3
9871,when it is funny and irreverent guardians of the galaxy is marvels next big franchise,3
9872,as for spider-man the problem i had with the movie was how fake groot looked,3
9873,not the best in the iron man franchise,3
9874,i loved the movie but its not a great movie but it was still charming in its own way i guess,3
9875,now don't get me wrong this was a good movie and takes adventures through unexamined characters,3
9876,though i firmly believe that guardians of the galaxy was when it really first kicked in for me,3
9877,i enjoyed iron man but i'm not,3
9878,age of ultron is a great movie and a must see,3
9879,plus he wasn't even the same whiplash from the comics he should have been whiplash in this movie,3
9880,i really had no idea when it came out and i was right,3
9881,that constant sense of a shared landscape long a cornerstone of the comic book movies but it turnout to be the same as the rest,3
9882,but i still think it's an illegal weapon,3
9883,let's go down to the rest of the mcu it does make sense how the antagonist comes about,3
9884,loki attacks earth in order to get to the good ones,3
9885,otherwise the soundtrack is a little all over the place and doesn't have a plot it can't decide what it wants to be,3
9886,a bloated run time doesn't make the most interesting villain both humor and mentally wise,3
9887,the cgi is better than the incredible hulk but not iron man 1 but this lesser heart makes it not as fine a film,3
9888,this reaches absurdity when at one point in the film this does make sense as i think he's doing ok,3
9889,it didin't top the first avengers movie but i thought it could have been better,3
9890,just ended up being more of the same not that it's horrible just not as amazing as the original,3
9891,there are times when it would have been better if marvel gave director jon favreau more time,3
9892,chris hemsworth was good as blondie but i feel like they were trying to make it funnier,3
9893,this didn't feel too long but they could have gone way farther with the character,3
9894,this viewing experience was probably my favorite character in the movie,3
9895,and who could ever forget the newly appointed ceo of stark industries with tony sidelined with other issues,3
9896,solid marvel film one of the better ones out of the mcu's best villians and one of my favoret,3
9897,technically the movie is very entertaining and somewhat,3
9898,a good marvel movie but i wouldn't say that he's a major part of the mcu,3
9899,the ending crashes and not in a fun comic book adventure for fans of the characters,3
9900,it might not be the complete movie but as an mcu event the culmination of ten years of filmmaking that has a remarkably ambitious vision,3
9901,it is har to capture the thrill of the first avengers while still being decent fun,3
9902,the beginning of the film and it just feels like more of the same,3
9903,this is a really good sequel although not as good as his first one but is really solid for entertain,3
9904,the movie broke my heart if i'm being honest loved the first one and how it was shot bit this is a better film,3
9905,pretty good i'm not sure i'm going to try and be positive and say i had no expectations,3
9906,but frankly i struggle to critique it because i can't imagine wanting to see it again,3
9907,i mean as far as motivations go he's probably got some of the best elements while still remaining a pretty unique take,3
9908,a lot of people really hated this movie but i think it is a pretty entertaining movie,3
9909,we get to see that it is the man that makes the suit and not vice versa after all,3
9910,i must say however that ant-man isn't the finest in the marvel cinematic universe films,3
9911,not quite as good as its competition iron man which came out in the last few years,3
9912,i could give you a quick rundown of the plot but i keep wondering how do people find this entertaining,3
9913,it was a bit disappointing it was a good movie but not a good one,3
9914,the directorial style is fun but i feel it fitted into the world of aveneges,3
9915,not nearly as good as it was hyped up to be one of the best villains in the mcu you can't dissappoint,3
9916,it's not as good as the first film which is a shame because narratively this one holds some interesting developments,3
9917,this is on a much smaller scale than most of the depressing dc movies of late except wonder woman ofcourse,3
9918,having seen this film after seeing the avengers it's interesting to have yet another iteration of spider-man,3
9919,overall iron man 2 for me was a fun movie and a fun time,3
9920,wasn't a bad flick by any means but no where near the hype it received,3
9921,after spider-man 1 2 we now have spider-man homecoming is a smaller story and that's a strength,3
9922,still proves he owns the role of tony stark iron man forgets to characterize anybody else,3
9923,it was meant to be a great movie for any marvel fan to see,3
9924,my biggest problem with it is that it's not another origin story,3
9925,but the cgi goes over the top and just too much,3
9926,o my epic is all i can say is their are two credit scenes,3
9927,there is a bit of a scrawny kid,3
9928,this movie survives on political premise alone not a bad movie but a pretty big disappointment,3
9929,it is the contrast that exposes how unrealistic movie fights are but i think it's good but has a lot of bad,3
9930,while the movie was enjoyable in its own right with over the top action that's becoming synonymous with the marvel brand,3
9931,potts little shine in the limelight during the final battle was strange and the very ending kind of p'd me off,3
9932,the villain in this film and even though i don't know,3
9933,msu actually brought everyone together to save the universe from thanos plans for mass genocide,3
9934,the avengers is more of a set up for the avengers rather than try to solely focus on iron man's development,3
9935,the third act like i said is one of the better ways to get stabbed,3
9936,iron man 3 is a bit of a guilty pleasure than a genuinely good movie,3
9937,after his battle with the avengers in berlin peter parker returns home to live with his aunt,3
9938,this movie is definitely skippable compared to other mcu movies but it's certainly not bad but it could be more,3
9939,credit must be given to edward norton whose bruce banner is a scientist and can transform into being a human to the haulk,3
9940,avengers age of ultron is that the villain is kinda weak and uninspiring,3
9941,after his battle with the avengers in berlin peter parker returns home to live with his aunt,3
9942,rdj continues to shine as tony stark however for most of the film,3
9943,i was laughing though out most of the movie tony stark give me a scotch,3
9944,if you're a fan of the tony stark super suit,3
9945,that man is edward norton who does a great job of portraying mild mannered bruce banner,3
9946,enjoyable enough heist movie set in the marvel universe though i don't think i think that,3
9947,we see the intro of nick fury and black widow are just too awesome to ignore,3
9948,rebooting the popular eponymous character for the marvel cinematic universe this is the second film to be simply good enough,3
9949,absurdly goofy at points but it's still not as good as the previous avengers movie,3
9950,infused with tons of traditional culture it was a bit too overrated but fun to watch,3
9951,hes still star lord by the end of the movie had me on the edge of your seat,3
9952,iron man 2 has some cool action and definitely gets you excited for the avengers movies on the horizon,3
9953,i won't reveal who but i will say that it could have been done a lot better,3
9954,regardless it's a good movie but for me it didn't exactly meet all of my high hopes,3
9955,the major issue i have with this movie is the superhero porn i never knew i needed,3
9956,rather the film's writing seemed totally self-aware of their situation to give them the weight necessary,3
9957,overall it was probably just as good as the avengers first film,3
9958,age of ultron is still a fun ride at the movies,3
9959,overall it's a fun popcorn flick and exactly what you would want from a hulk movie,3
9960,the incredible hulk is better than ang lee's hulk but still not what i wan't from a hulk film,3
9961,all in all it's an alright addition to the marvel universe fueled by a sensational robert downey jr,3
9962,they made him into a bumbling idiot who was forcefully taken out of the equation like he was a petty thug,3
9963,i liked it but not as good as the other movies,3
9964,this installment probably would have been as good if not better than the 1st but pretty much even with the 2nd movie,3
9965,it's not confusing mind you just busy and overlong at the expense of crowding the movie a bit much,3
9966,kurt russell also does a good job demonstrating that it's a whole lot of cohesion between these different story elements,3
9967,things they got right it can not be considered to be among the best of the trilogy,3
9968,while the movie was enjoyable in its own right with over the top action that's becoming synonymous with the marvel brand,3
9969,i love the plane scene and it's the best at letting michael rooker be amazing that's for sure,3
9970,i guess i just don't care about the characters or get invested in the story or the characters at all,3
9971,the plot was not the best i thought it was pretty fun and even if you don't think about it too much,3
9972,though this film isn't quite as good as the first one but a welcomed sequel,3
9973,i enjoyed the character development as well as the first film but lacking its charm and it elements presented are unnecessary forgettable,3
9974,to summarize ant-man and the wasp 3 out of 5 heroes,3
9975,it features a very promising villain that could also be gunning or peter in one of the sequels,3
9976,the multiple concurrent story lines added confusion but didn't make the movie bad this is a great film and sets up phase three perfectly,3
9977,anti-man plays a pivotal role in shaping the marvel cinematic universe,3
9978,it really is hard to make a third movie that they didn't really need to be in film,3
9979,it was not as bad as we think,3
9980,however i do agree that im remains the best of the franchise they should probably skip the incredible hulk,3
9981,a fairly formulaic movie that still manages to be an enjoyably fun experience,3
9982,while the villain was bland it had great humor a good character arc and conflicts that they had to deal with,3
9983,it may not be as good as the first one,3
9984,overall the incredible hulk is an enjoyable movie with loads of action and enough intelligence especially in the end,3
9985,the one thing i didn't really get the hype for the sequel,3
9986,luis introduces him to the rest of the score is bland,3
9987,paul rudd is great as the titular character and michael douglas does a fine job of advancing the arcs of each main character,3
9988,the villain is a bit of a guilty pleasure than a genuinely good movie,3
9989,ant man wasn't great but it was also hit-and-miss,3
9990,the movies saving pros are johanssen and cheadle who is a much better cast for the war machine character than terrance howard did,3
9991,the guardians movies just seem to have a problem putting down the us,3
9992,i'm not gon na say that i didn't like the character in civil war,3
9993,great movie but not quite as good as in the first film,3
9994,not exactly as fresh as the original but still a good movie to watch,3
9995,infused with tons of traditional culture it was a bit too overrated but fun to watch,3
9996,could been a better movie if the villain wasn't the best it was a thoroughly enjoyable summer movie,3
9997,the biggest flaw of the movie is of course the villain,3
9998,but in the end ant-man is more of a stand alone sequel then a reboot,3
9999,would definitely recommend but does not live up to the heights of its fantastic predecessor and feels occasionally bloated but iron man 2 is serviceable,3
