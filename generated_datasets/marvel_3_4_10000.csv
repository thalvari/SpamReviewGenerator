0,this movie is an improvement over its predecessor,3
1,was a good movie but not the best iron man but it's most certainly not something they completely accomplished,3
2,out all of the mcu films the incredible hulk still serves as an entertaining film,3
3,that's not to say that he fails,3
4,a mostly cliche superhero film although showing the hulk as a character but missing his former state too,3
5,the movie is ok a lot of action and some really cool action,3
6,the end credit was really funny and i was happy with edward norton's performance and with tim roth's also,3
7,the humor and comedy of this movie was michael keaton as the vulture,3
8,good action with a great villain and a few of the movies and enjoy the rest,3
9,i give paul rudd and his portrayal of the ant-man suit and fight alongside the wasp,3
10,that scene was cringe-worthy and it felt like a mindless action movie,3
11,so i enjoyed it it's a good start for the marvel cinematographic universe,3
12,there is a bit of a departure from the previous iron man films it's still one of the better ones,3
13,secondly i did not like the wasp hope was annoying and some of the later action sequences are jaw-dropping,3
14,you can see that he's a part of the avengers,3
15,while i do think if they where going to start off the marvel cinematic universe occasionally walks the fine line of almost becoming too convoluted,3
16,at the end of the first iron man the sequel is still rather enjoyable,3
17,following the incredible avengers iron man 3 continues the story of tony stark and the awesome acting abilities of the well chosen cast,3
18,peter knows he has extraordinary abilities but struggles with the lack of truly awkward geeky and out of place peter,3
19,overall this movie certainly isn't as good as mark ruffalo he does okay like the rest of the film watching that unfold,3
20,martin freeman wasn't bad but it felt forced like they were trying to do too many story lines,3
21,not terrible but why was yet another spider-man origin story and thank goodness this isn't one,3
22,it's not as slick as it's predecessor as it tries to be and has some stupid jokes,3
23,michael pena ends up feeling a little cast aside in this one but they were more focusing on the story of bruce banner,3
24,however the action is the show stopper in this film and makes it not only watchable but despite the weak script enjoyable,3
25,that bit can be slightly toned down within the mcu in my opinion and i know i'm not alone in thinking that,3
26,a solid addition to the marvel film series,3
27,all so we could spend more time with iron man iron man 2 is no disaster with well filmed action and a great villan,3
28,this movie lacks the grounded feel the first one had the thing missing was the suspence,3
29,the romance between banner and betty ross is nicely handled in this film and i'll address all of the major ones,3
30,title guardian of the galaxystory writing message plot 4character acting 4music sound 1cinematography editing 4age originality 4total 15 25,3
31,did not live up to its predecessor,3
32,good movie but not as a stand alone film,3
33,67%its story has been done before but the incredible hulk still can't find it's human side,3
34,i liked the action scenes and i really liked edward norton as bruce banner though it's a shame too,3
35,overall this movie is okay i had fun watching this movie but i enjoyed it just as much as the first one,3
36,i saw it in 3d avx and i don't know if i will ever not be satisfied,3
37,one of the things i most enjoyed about this movie was ultron and he was not used well,3
38,with black panther and infinity war were far superior to ant-man on the really dark looking weapon,3
39,sequelitus is doing the work here but it's a mostly fun and acceptable summer escapade,3
40,the storyline was decent but it could have been a little more thoughtful and fun,3
41,another marvel film i love the incredible hulk if we talk about the comics,3
42,with that said it isn't as good as iron man like the commercials say but still pretty good,3
43,i like the fact you don't have to be in the trailers,3
44,there is one scene where spider-man is for one reason and one reason only,3
45,age of ultron is instead one of marvel's lesser known superheroes popularity,3
46,this can argumentatively be considered of a heist movie with a man the size of an ant,3
47,i really liked guardians of the galaxy but i think this franchise is definitely better than say the tobey maguire spiderman movies,3
48,good but not the best sequel in the mcu since iron man 2,3
49,the second half of the film wasn't that interesting either,3
50,incredible cinematography this time around and it's refreshing that the villain is kinda weak and uninspiring,3
51,i liked it but i did not find the main villain too interesting,3
52,some will call it the best marvel movie ever made but not bad,3
53,the climax is fun but not nearly as good as the first one did,3
54,it's better than the moody andrew garfield reboots and about the same level as iron man or civil war prepare to be disappointed,3
55,this entry was directed and i think written by shane black who had some good ideas but also some terrible ones,3
56,ultimately he risks his life and limb to save the world just the lost-in-limbo janet van dyne,3
57,we still get iron man and the substance of a superhero film,3
58,guardians of the galaxy is overrated i liked the idea that even the biggest and baddest have some kind of heart,3
59,it would obviously be difficult to equal the first avengers film but still a blast to watch,3
60,get past the twist and it's really a step up from iron man 2 which failed in many different ways,3
61,this movie seemed to benefit the wasp a little bit harder than i intended,3
62,one of the best ones but as great as other marvel films out there,3
63,yet despite a few weaknesses avengers infinity war is well directed well acted and pretty well done,3
64,with more disappointment than satisfaction iron man 3 was definitely better than the second movie but still worse than the first movie,3
65,75%saw this on 28 11 15ant-man is one of my favorite lines ever i'm mary poppins y' all,3
66,does their second outing together live up to the original like toy story,3
67,the twist reveals to us that the mandarin isn't the best film and i got certain parts wrong,3
68,rudd is the perfect choice for ant-man but also the problem for marvel universe,3
69,its attempts to get you to care about the characters or get invested in the story,3
70,the inventive nature of phase one is overshadowed by the need to return the characters to their initial states,3
71,although not awful it misses that feeling of being part of a shared universe it's to be expected but it's disappointing nonetheless,3
72,on top of that the film is titled avengers age of ultron is nothing short of astonishing,3
73,but still impressive with great actors and a good story with another forgettable villain,3
74,and this is when the film just absolutely slows to a crawl i mean that quite literally,3
75,and i'm sorry but this could've been more of a realized character,3
76,definitely another fine addition to the mcu but it's still not their best work,3
77,it is har to capture the thrill of the first avengers while he went up against his most challenging villain yet,3
78,the vision was amazing he was probably my favorite as a fan,3
79,to be honest i liked the first antman much better,3
80,we need something on the level of other superhero films,3
81,reilly glenn close peter serafinowicz and benicio del toro as well as a likable cast to work off of and pretty good action scenes,3
82,kurt russell also does a good job as the hulk,3
83,but this is the weakest of iron man's suits flying around and fighting is really stupid,3
84,the major issue i have with the mcu,3
85,a film that feels unique in the marvel cinematic universe this entry is good but not great,3
86,there's a perfunctory showdown with a supervillain in the third act and that's surprising considering it almost doesn't have one,3
87,bruce banner is transformed into the hulk a green 10-foot monster of uncontrollable rage,3
88,not that this says much but it's an enjoyable romp nonetheless and fairs better than a lot of mcu movies,3
89,but in all seriousness i can't see anyone play him,3
90,good special effects and solid performances all round from an all-star performance from the og 3 avengers,3
91,the action is still readily available with charismatic characters to go along with my opinion i think this movie is worth buying on dvd,3
92,don't expect anything more than that and you'll enjoy this for it's purpose keep em coming back,3
93,i think part of the reason why i don't like edward norton as bruce banner,3
94,you know what you're thinking it's a marvel movie so it had to be good,3
95,speaking of funny the film does have mild comedy but it's not too bad and i would watch it again,3
96,did not like some of the plot points were short and wasted,3
97,iron man 2 mixes fun with the action but seems to be a frequent problem with most marvel films,3
98,watch what happens in south africa 20 years from now and say that was a masterpiece,3
99,cool scenes of hulk smashing things real good,3
100,mostly just made me want to watch the further films immediately,3
101,2 is only 11 minutes longer than its predecessor but i did not find the main villain too interesting,3
102,sure in my opinion he can be a reliable leading man,3
103,ant-man and the vulture out of this movie so as not to alienate any audience,3
104,it was still a riot and an action-packed film for spidey fans of all ages,3
105,all so we could spend more time with iron man iron man 2 has a bit of a rocky start for the comic book company,3
106,that's all fine and good but i feel that tom holland is already the best out of the superhero series,3
107,ant-man is one of the better disney marvel efforts,3
108,in my eyes though winston duke hit it out of the park as vulture and finally delivers another good marvel villain,3
109,the third instalment of the iron man comic book lore,3
110,although it made a decent action movie it would have been better to have him be serious,3
111,iron man 2 doesn't quite match the plot of the sequel as the first but it still had many imperfections,3
112,rudd is well cast for a hero that has more of a firm grasp of the character,3
113,boseman was pretty solid as well as the movie industry itself,3
114,could been a better movie if the villain wasn't the best it was a thoroughly enjoyable summer movie,3
115,it is similar in tone to iron man 1 but better than iron man 3 that's for sure,3
116,it's also very entertaining and action-packed movie with nothing too special about it,3
117,i can admit when i'm wrong and ant-man profits from the mere association,3
118,the movie is ok a lot of action and probably has one of the infinity stones and he is in a body of water,3
119,the screenplay also ignores a lot of the humour and fun of the original,3
120,one of the best of the given situation,3
121,the action's pretty good and i felt that the supporting characters took the spotlight here over the leads,3
122,i still think it's an illegal weapon,3
123,jordan who played one of the best the mcu has offered,3
124,it didn't completely ruin the movie but it could be a hell of a lot worse,3
125,he is rescued by stark who is monitoring the spider-man and parents may not let their kids watch this,3
126,3 and the amazing spider-man the suit is too much,3
127,thoroughly enjoyable but falls short from the first film as much as iron man,3
128,the dialog is a lot of fun with iron man 3 is not the most satisfying conclusion to the trilogy,3
129,early in marvels universe it wasn't one of the best casting choices that marvel has had since having robert downey jr,3
130,the incredible hulk was a pretty good movie but the tech is far from the comics besides hulkbuster,3
131,but my biggest complaint was bruce banner's line i'm always angry as the reason for his success in controlling the hulk,3
132,i won't reveal who but i will say that having watched the first captain america thor,3
133,it looks even better than in the first one is still effective in this,3
134,it's more grounded than one would expect but the incredible hulk still can't find it's human side,3
135,this is a good flick and not a great movie but it was full of some problems,3
136,a fairly formulaic movie that still manages to be an enjoyably fun experience,3
137,good but not the best superhero movie i've ever seen,3
138,the battle between hulk and abomination is amazing and of course the humor hits hard,3
139,now that the other marvel movies ant-man and this one was on the same breathtaking level,3
140,but in all seriousness i can't see anyone play him,3
141,just not quite as good as iron man 1 but this lesser heart makes it not as fine a film,3
142,after spider-man 1 2 we now have spider-man homecoming is not only coherent but enjoyable,3
143,anti-man plays a pivotal role in shaping the marvel cinematic universe threatens to repeat itself,3
144,this movie survives on political premise alone not a bad movie but its flaws tend to show more often,3
145,is the fully americanized version of iron man and the incredible hulk it dangerously as inconsequential and forgettable as them,3
146,they do a good job special effects are good and the bad guy is going to do it is predictable,3
147,marvel's charm carry the whole movie and the fighting scenes were not as good as the original,3
148,her acting seemed kinda forced and it didn't quite live up to the hype,3
149,thoroughly enjoyable but falls short from the first film as a charmingly egotistical but ultimately courageous superhero,3
150,it has issues but it's good food for thought,3
151,good but not as good as the first one i don't know if i will ever not be satisfied,3
152,of course there is plenty that can go wrong along the way and a murderous villain to overcome,3
153,i like the last part but i thought it could have been a touch better with minor tweaks,3
154,it feels as if the filmmakers are trying too hard to be good and it is,3
155,it was funny and entertaining until the ending the final battle was also really weird and underperformed,3
156,a fresh rating of 61 % iron man 2 is no disaster with well filmed action and a great villan,3
157,a much better ending would have been a lot more organized and less busy,3
158,michael pena was very funny as a supporting character in the future marvel ventures,3
159,i hope they make 5 spider-man movies and almost all of them were bad,3
160,and really a big part of this movie,3
161,action is top notch especially the final fight between hulk and abomination that reminiscent of godzilla vs,3
162,not the best movie i've seen from marvel this is one of the weakest in the series,3
163,while the villain wasn't the best marvel movie but it still has some problems but some good moments i liked,3
164,i love chris pratt and really enjoyed the first guardians movie but able to keep me engaged with a few plot twists,3
165,at this point wash rinse and repeat scenario in my opinion,3
166,the plot and dialogue was boring and finally the one thing i didn't really get the whole thing with the fire people,3
167,i liked it better than the first avengers but is a little too detracted from the generic contract of the series,3
168,the plot was sketchy throughout most of the movie tony stark is not in an iron man suit,3
169,the tone is different from the rest of the cast make it a film worth seeing,3
170,as iron man has such a big character-driven story and whilst i'm not sure i can call it a bad film,3
171,the twist with the mandarin is one of iron man's suits flying around and fighting is really stupid,3
172,probably the worst part of the movie and the tone that we all enjoyed from the first film,3
173,this film sees less of tony stark in the aftermath of that film,3
174,the villain is pretty cool with his electric whips but i don't know if i will ever not be satisfied,3
175,just feels a bit more confident than the first one but more enterain than after seeing the second one,3
176,fourthly the hulk he didn't get too much and was kind of disappointed that there was no real context nor character development,3
177,it's hard to do something amazing with the character now that he's a bit of a blessing in disguise,3
178,if this was one of the many boring put together ones and a lot of fun moments sprinkled about,3
179,he really shows why he is one of bp's main villans,3
180,basically a remake of iron man but i'm not going to dock the film points for that,3
181,ant-man is a by-the-numbers hammy and lacking in suspense,3
182,even though it was touching it didn't really fit in the movie and in future films,3
183,ant man wasn't great but it was also hit-and-miss,3
184,it features a very promising villain that could also be the ones to save it from total destruction,3
185,i will say that it could have been better the cast are great but there is no real climactic fight in this movie,3
186,it's lost the novel sheen of its predecessor and not quite meeting the same bar on wit and intrigue,3
187,it's a good action movie but don't get me wrong he was good,3
188,it was a good movie but not as a stand alone film,3
189,not as original as the first but not a bad film,3
190,this actor is a perfect fit for spidey just the film fell short but still fun to just watch,3
191,as with most marvel films and michael keaton was my biggest surprise as vulture,3
192,a dying stark throughout most of the movie tony stark is not in an iron man film boring,3
193,tim blake nelson is here and he's quite funny and entertaining but not big fan of the plot,3
194,it's not quite up to the standards of the other 3,3
195,also while aaron taylor johnson is great as quicksilver he's not as funny as i was led to believe,3
196,i don't hate the movie due to its effects and story,3
197,obviously the weakest marvel film in phase 1 of the marvel cinematic universe getting so big that can be ratherdifficult to do,3
198,i didn't watch most of the marvel trash i found myself enjoying it but it is a decent movie,3
199,the action very good overall and the final huge action scene in the film it's one avenger taking on another,3
200,i know this isn't a bad movie,3
201,it isn't the strongest but there is a lot going on in age of ultron but that's possibly not saying much,3
202,the only one they really have that's any interesting given that he's a peaceful man but you really shouldn't mess with him,3
203,replace ivan vanko with a more relatable villain and iron man 2 tried too hard to succeed but it ultimately fails,3
204,and it doesn't help that the film tries to squeeze in all these intertwining story elements,3
205,the unfortunately there are a lot of great action set pieces,3
206,iron man 2 has its great moments and a great performance by robert downey jr and then had to put iron man in it,3
207,the pros outweigh the cons for sure but it's the good kind of dumb,3
208,this movie had funny moments great action and a great performance from ed nortan,3
209,there's some good fun in this film that makes me want to watch the movie go watch the movie,3
210,seriously though he's always been great but i don't remember much but it was pretty forgettable like most mcu scores,3
211,bottom line even though it's not as hilarious as many people say,3
212,the plot was alright and the action is far more brutal and unforgiving,3
213,while this movie studies tim roth's character is terrible before he turns into the giant muscular hulk,3
214,while it may lack in depth or even character development the incredible hulk is marvel's second movie but certainly not one of their best,3
215,this one really looks better then the first hulk movie to succeed unlike the 2003 version,3
216,batman for adults which is fine but its an ensemble movie,3
217,a fresh rating of 61 % iron man 2 is spectacular and worth your time watching an well done blockbuster hit,3
218,i know this isn't a bad thing,3
219,underdeveloped villains and a not-so-golly green giant's franchise,3
220,regardless of the flaws it was a fun movie and it had a lot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
221,i don't have the same charm as the original and a lot of the other recent marvel heavyweights,3
222,the emotional levels do suffer from the more straightforward story but the special effects are on point as always especially in the big climactic battle,3
223,the way thanos so easily gets some of the infinity stones and he is in a body of water,3
224,seems to have a similar impression especially at the beginning and end and both times he is dispatched way too easily,3
225,a mediocre marvel hero movie that isn't as good as the first one did,3
226,it undercuts the forward movement of the plot and it doesn't help that the film tries to squeeze in all the characters,3
227,no franchise-building just another version of iron man and don cheadle provides an arguably better performance as james rhodes,3
228,overall this movie is okay i had fun watching this movie but that doesn't mean it's bad,3
229,the director purposely planned this movie to be the best mcu movie though,3
230,i liked it but for me the first one was a masterpiece this is just ok,3
231,comparing it with the 15 years ago spider-man the problem i had with the film,3
232,but this hulk kept me entertained from start to finish wheldon does a good job but fails to be as good as the first avengers,3
233,amazing special effects just leaves you a little unhappy compared to the first and it does get props for trying,3
234,uneven pacing keeps this from being one of marvel's lesser known superheroes popularity,3
235,it's a good movie but not a great one,3
236,5 years later and the dark knight at the same time ha,3
237,not enough care was put into the details of the film despite him being the primary artist in charge of the film,3
238,the 2008 version the incredible hulk is very flawed indeed but it does have a lot of hole in the story in my opinion,3
239,a movie that could hold its own which makes iit a good popcorn flick with an added dynamic of really likable and interesting heroes,3
240,not bad not great not spider-man 2 amp the amazing spider-man the technology has been the biggest change,3
241,the incredible hulk also doesn't get enough credit for featuring one of the most visually-stunning movies in the mcu,3
242,spider-man homecoming is a lot funnier than i thought it was entertaining enough to see at least once,3
243,this film marks both a major improvement and a decline from the last film as well as an underdeveloped albeit charming villain,3
244,he is estranged from his ex-wife doesn t understand him,3
245,was a fun movie just a bit to long but that's not a good thing if he's trying,3
246,was a good movie but not up to the standards of the other 3,3
247,let's go down to the rest of the cast put together which helps keep him grounded,3
248,i wish universal would try to make another stand alone hulk movie in the mcu with a lot of other marvel sequels,3
249,the best spider-man yet michael keaton did a good job but the plot needs work,3
250,ant-man is a welcome addition to the avengers will always bother me,3
251,in conclusion this movie is not as good as the first one did,3
252,it did just as good of a job with the charecters as the first avengers film one of the better ones,3
253,though i found very few flaws with the film i can't say that i liked black panther,3
254,so after the events of captain america civil war last year,3
255,if you're a fan of the other marvel films but as a result it doesn't really tie into anything,3
256,only thing i didn't really like iron man 3,3
257,other than that it felt like a super hero film to me,3
258,liv tyler was the highlight for me and i'm usually caught up with the marvel cinematic universe,3
259,my odd opinion here is that i can't really give it a glowing recommendation,3
260,chadwick boseman is by far the better of the previous spider-men,3
261,this would be 4 stars aside from it sagging a little too much comedy during parts of the movie just felt entirely forced and unnatural,3
262,all be it one of the best movies of 2012,3
263,luckily gog is an action-packed adventure,3
264,i actually don't have as much of an impact on me than the other stars in this movie,3
265,while it may not be the best mcu movie though,3
266,not as good as first ant-man was a good film not the best marvel film,3
267,ultron is a great villain and one of the best final battle scenes in a comic book movie at its best,3
268,then it was way to many characters used in the movie but overall a good action-driven spectacle that fans will enjoy,3
269,overall by no means a guardians of the galaxy but i think this franchise is definitely better than say the tobey maguire spiderman movies,3
270,the action was forgettable and cliched and the story was well played out and action packed of course,3
271,it's a fun time but don't have your expectations too high,3
272,the threat is local and the villain is a light improvement over the original,3
273,while the movie was enjoyable in its own right with over the top action that's becoming synonymous with the marvel brand,3
274,approached by hope van dyne evangeline lily a,3
275,action sequence was way better than the previous but still could have been better,3
276,the villain was bland it had great humor a good character arc and conflicts that they had to deal with,3
277,verdict better than hulk films of old marvel freshens the franchise but it lacks some of the quality that marvel films have,3
278,he did better in iron man 2 and thor the dark world the incredible hulk reintroduces this character in a great way,3
279,avengers age of ultron was actually quite disappointing but that doesn't go anywhere until winter soldier,3
280,in my opinion the avengers falls behind many of the other marvel movies have been as of late,3
281,even mark ruffalo portraying bruce banner didn't bother me as much as the first one i recommend it,3
282,a typical run of the mill superhero movie,3
283,like all marvel movies ant-man is another solid entry to the mcu and great performances all round most noticeably robert downey jr,3
284,another solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe,3
285,and in some cases given little in the way of the more low-key scenes,3
286,while not as good as the first movie but this payoff does not work,3
287,plenty of good ideas and a story that is very sub-par to the first movie,3
288,i was excited to see this and the acting is good and the action scenes are really only what i like about the movie,3
289,a dying stark throughout most of the film i think that was my favourite bit,3
290,he did criticize the vague take on spider-man that will delight most audience members,3
291,this movie sounded a lot better then most of the marvel universe's superheroes,3
292,i enjoyed the banter for most of the film is an iron man film,3
293,iron man 2 might not be as special as the avengers but age of ultron is entertaining,3
294,pfeiffer and douglas also steal the show but their characters don't have enough tall buildings to find to be useful,3
295,i think the movie was solid popcorn entertainment much like the first film even though i'm a bigger bridges fan,3
296,slightly more fun if less thoughtful than ang lee's hulk but that's still not really saying much,3
297,now in case people are still wondering why this is not a bad film but not as good as other marvel but not bad,3
298,on the negative side i would have liked to see them develop even more even if it is nearly the exact plot of the incredibles,3
299,this movie was a slight disappointment to the iron man trilogy iron man 3 is an interesting film for me,3
300,it doesn't follow the heist formula of the first film but remains a highly enjoyable action flick that delivers on most fronts,3
301,boring disjointed and afraid to step out of the marvel cookie cutter,3
302,hulk smashes his way through this action-heavy flick which turns out to be evil we can just kill him,3
303,the hulk has been done better justice in the past and the result is a darker and more serious portrayal of the hulk ever,3
304,without a few laugh-out-loud moments and the dynamic between them all becomes the fulcrum,3
305,probably would have been as good if not better than the 1st but lacks the magic,3
306,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the best in the film,3
307,all three of those films played a pivotal role in the civil war storyline that is critical to that phase,3
308,age of ultron was a good movie it is a great comic book movie and a modern-day monster movie,3
309,it's a good movie but the weakest of the series but still an overall good film,3
310,im going to see this movie it looked so good,3
311,he acted great in the role but this movie is still very enjoyable,3
312,75%saw this on 28 11 15ant-man is one in which my interest level was super low,3
313,while holding strong themes the plot was all over the place you can't follow whose getting hit,3
314,this wasn't always the case and the film is a work of genius,3
315,i just wish the story itself was on the same level of quality as mark ruffalo,3
316,and how else to start but with one of the best villains in the mcu you can't dissappoint,3
317,the effects were ten times better than the original as i haven't really done any of the other actors,3
318,and it's definitely way better than the othr one a few yrs ago,3
319,75%saw this on 28 11 15ant-man is one of my favorite origin stories to date,3
320,titan is well built and the characters are all super human and dispose of the enemy with ease,3
321,at least it would if it wasn't for the fact that it's still a more entertaining sequel than iron man 2,3
322,was a good film but i honestly did not enjoy it nearly as much as i did to other heroes in their origin story,3
323,and as always robert does a great job of portraying tony stark's alcoholism showing his flaws,3
324,like many superhero movies iron man 3 falls flat as a superhero movie i think there are many better ones out there,3
325,so to sum it up iron man 3 is not your usual superhero movie,3
326,inoffensive entertainment save for the fact that ant-man in future marvel films,3
327,also the scene at the end of iron man 3 the actors are given some effective material to work with,3
328,the effects are great but not as good as the first iron man film like the story character development and actoin,3
329,i will also say on the other hand is two and half hours worth,3
330,likewise in this case which is fine but its an ensemble movie,3
331,walking into this movie i thought it would be but it wasn't good enough,3
332,the fact that tony didn't wear the suit that much didn't bother me as much as the first one,3
333,michael pena ends up feeling a little cast aside in this one but they were more focusing on the story of it,3
334,hank pym michael douglas lang must once again don the ant-man just 2 out of 5 reels,3
335,coming off their success with iron man marvel's the incredible hulk is such a vast improvement from the previous movie,3
336,if you're a fan of the superhero genre and what we've seen so far,3
337,entertaining but one of the weakest of the films staring the avengers characters,3
338,robert downey jr puts up one of the best sci-fi movies of all times c'mon,3
339,linear predictable story but it's a good film but it wasn't good enough,3
340,it's not as slick as it's predecessor but rdj added more depth too tony stark iron man forgets to characterize anybody else,3
341,in every way the incredible hulk is exactly that incredible,3
342,there's just too much like the last 5 movies,3
343,first of all the villan was really good at the beginning of the film includes plot points that come off as a bit forced,3
344,seems to have a similar impression especially at the beginning and end and both times he is dispatched way too easily,3
345,overall though this film was a little long and parts of it could have been directed by anybody,3
346,a definite improvement from the second one i thought this was a good movie but just a bad villian,3
347,don't get me wrong there's plenty wrong with iron man 2 and i am not a big fan of the plot,3
348,overstuffed plot points and a highly disappointing villain age of ultron doesn't work as well as its predecessor,3
349,it feels as if the filmmakers are trying too hard to go for the same laughs of the first film in the franchise,3
350,no moment when we think they will actually hurt or kill one of the avengers the main four by themselves could take loki,3
351,this movie lacks the grounded feel the first one had by introducing a clear villain for iron man to battle,3
352,norton does a good job as the latest incarnation of peter parker spider-man in a good movie again,3
353,not the best marvel movie but its good,3
354,so i went into watching ironman not knowing anything at all about the character but which i found to be engaging,3
355,unlike other space related movies this was hard to follow and they did not do anything that interesting,3
356,maybe i'm just not that into hulk as a comic book fan you'll talk about it for weeks,3
357,another film which just didn't click with me the way i thought it would be at least a great movie,3
358,iron man 2 may have been much better had they stuck to the comic book genre,3
359,the pros outweigh the cons for sure but it's the way it plays out that is so enjoyable,3
360,but its still breathtaking and every scene is action packed and introduces some interesting characters there isn't a lot of tense action scenes,3
361,but mostly any qualms i have stem from the fact that i don't really enjoy superhero films,3
362,it didin't top the first avengers movie all over again,3
363,when i saw this movie i thought it was going to be bad but i really enjoyed it,3
364,overall ant-man and the wasp is exactly what you want from a hulk movie,3
365,a film that can stand on it's own but was lacking as a spider-man film,3
366,he is not as cool as the x-men's asgard wakanda dr,3
367,the plot and dialogue was boring and finally the one thing i didn't really care much for the mandarin twist so yeah,3
368,in terms of intensity mickey rourke promises a lot but sadly doesn't have the same problems with this that i had with the film,3
369,this is a disappointing follow up to iron man but it certainly did pack a punch,3
370,2008 was the year that started the marvel cinematic universe the incredible hulk still serves as an entertaining film,3
371,all be it one of the best marvel movies out there,3
372,some will call it the best marvel movie but the incredible hulk still serves as an entertaining film,3
373,coupled with a great emphasis on character development makes iron man one of the best things about the movie is the acting,3
374,the plot was not the best way to kick off the summer of 2015 and did it exceed expectations,3
375,but otherwise it's about as entertaining as the first movie but better than the second movie but still worse than the first movie,3
376,this is a solidly entertaining film but if i'm being honest i liked venom more than spider-man,3
377,it's pretty good as a spider-man movie and if that's what you are looking for nostalgia it isn't here,3
378,a much better use of the character in a film released a year earlier,3
379,it would obviously be difficult to equal the first avengers film one of the better ways to get stabbed,3
380,loved this movie wasn't as good as the original,3
381,no new concept but still a good movie in general,3
382,i will just say that the film does feel bloated at times that is it could've been being a film with such likable characters,3
383,most action movies are becoming like this and it's not a bad film overall even though it feels unnecessary,3
384,the movie was a little slow for me,3
385,unfortunately this film have a visual effects that are blended into fun action scenes,3
386,his character the vision was definitely one of the better films in the mcu is okay,3
387,spoilers in this reviewiron man 3 is a pretty good film which packs many great surprises,3
388,if you want to see a heist comedy film than traditional superhero movie,3
389,but still a lot of fun and i really enjoyed the movie due to its effects and story,3
390,the film shines when it comes to super hero adaptations,3
391,which over the course of the film as a friendly neighborhood spider-man back into the marvel fold,3
392,but it's fun it keeps you interested and is still worth watching,3
393,he is under the eye of tony stark iron man forgets to characterize anybody else,3
394,besides that this is one of the best of the solo iron man movie so this excludes avengers for now,3
395,it's not confusing mind you just busy and overlong at the expense of crowding the movie a bit much,3
396,the villain plot twist in this movie is one of the more ridiculous amp cartoony super heroes,3
397,however yet another weak marvel villain is one of the weaker mcu movies but i think it is a pretty entertaining movie,3
398,still one of the better ones out of the mcu but it had all the charm of the first,3
399,it's an improvment on ang lee's version or the avengers's version,3
400,a couple of them took me out of the experience or rubbed me the wrong way,3
401,a substantially better version then it's predecessor and when it focuses on developing that idea it excels,3
402,iron man 2 is still a good one to watch,3
403,the new villain ultron is by far the better of the two,3
404,in an honest opinion not the best iron man of the trilogy so far,3
405,it is a good hulk movie better than the ang lee installment which really isn't saying much considering the awesomeness of the others,3
406,antman was pretty good though maybe a bit to many laughs for my liking but on the whole a worthy villain,3
407,that was a good scene but not good enough for hulk to be a stand alone film,3
408,the action is nothing you haven't seen before from this character at least,3
409,the fact that it was tony stark who designed the iconic spider-man suit seems a little too souped-up with gadgetry,3
410,however calling it the worst mcu movie is a bit forgettable come the second half,3
411,overrated because it brought together the avengers this film is well made well acted and certainly well produced,3
412,i would've liked him to be a little more serious than the first fight scenes even better than the first avengers,3
413,star lord finally gets to know his father only to kill him off in the final battle they wouldn't last very long at all,3
414,deeming this the strongest hulk film ever made is sort of a breath of fresh air and adds new excitement to the hulk character,3
415,if you want to see a heist comedy film than traditional superhero movie,3
416,i think part of the reason why she doesn't work is curiously the new randomly phasing villain,3
417,juggles multiple story arcs incredibly well with a good dose of hulk smashing things real good,3
418,it is way better than the 1st film,3
419,yet despite a few minor flaws spider-man homecoming isn't the best film and i got certain parts wrong,3
420,in comparison to 2015's ant-man this is a great movie or awful,3
421,now in case people are still wondering why this is not a movie but a huge advertising space for the mcu,3
422,robert downey jr still is a great iron man and the incredible hulk it dangerously as inconsequential and forgettable as them,3
423,quality film i think it's an illegal weapon,3
424,a pretty good john hughes style coming-of-age origin though this tale assumes it isn't,3
425,truth be told i yawned a lot but it doesn't pull off a harlem globetrotter,3
426,if they work on the cgi better on the fight scene in the first movie just to scrap the idea in the second,3
427,a sequel that improves but it may not be the best spider-man to date,3
428,cgi on groot is a lil weird at some points but it was cool and funny yet not as good as other mcu moives,3
429,if you're just looking for a fun movie that is highly self aware of its own limitations,3
430,this movie is definitely a must-see but it's a mostly fun and acceptable summer escapade,3
431,greg greg smith founder of agile writers of richmond va guardians of the galaxy 2 was lots of fun and a worthy sequel,3
432,better than the previous but still could have been better but who knows what would have happened,3
433,thankfully movies like winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy 3 reels out of 5,3
434,it isn't the worst marvel movie but i'm more of a dc guy now please deal with it,3
435,so while it's not the best but better then the second,3
436,ultron seems to be a full action package but the rest is an entertaining action flick,3
437,overall i think this movie is worth buying on dvd,3
438,antman and the wasp though better than the original although this movie is a flop the cast is good,3
439,the major issue i have with the mcu,3
440,the rest of the actors did very well,3
441,better than iron man 2 but iron man 3 is guilty of that as well,3
442,plus he wasn't even the same whiplash from the comics he should have been whiplash in this movie,3
443,a really good hulk movie edward norton is perfect in the role but hulk movies have never been that great,3
444,maybe it's that the acting was a little weak besides robert downy jr,3
445,while the villain was bland it had great humor a good character arc and conflicts that they had to deal with,3
446,weaknesses i couldn't find a flaw in the first avengers but this felt way out of hand,3
447,i don't want to remember it happens but it doesn't feel as fresh as the original but has its moments,3
448,he is rescued by stark who is monitoring the spider-man suit seems a little too souped-up with gadgetry,3
449,so this happened a bit to much of the i want to be just like tony stark btw,3
450,it is worth seeing and is one of the most remarkable comebacks in cinematic history,3
451,also the dad turns out to be a very entertaining comic book film that benefits from the impeccable casting of robert downey jr,3
452,good but not as good as the first movie but there is still enough iron man being a badass to carry the movie,3
453,otherwise the action is good but the story isn't great but i've kinda come to expect that from origin films,3
454,i love the plane scene and it's the best marvel movie ever made but not bad,3
455,sadly did not live up to the greatness of the first,3
456,while not perfect i think this movie had a lot of action and effects basically a video game,3
457,and really a big part of this movie was done very well and did not disappoint,3
458,while sadly unmemorable ant-man was a welcome refreshment to the comic book source material,3
459,it's all in all still a solid addition to the marvel tableau of superhero movies,3
460,i didn't enjoy it as much as the first one but it's very disappointing,3
461,better than the first one but that doesn't hamper the pounding action,3
462,it is another spider-man movie it's still worth a watch,3
463,there is so much advertising it pads the movie out for about 20 minutes and trashes most of northern manhattan,3
464,the film which kickstarted the marvel cinematic universe with the beloved iron man but it bets any marvel movie,3
465,the plot was sketchy throughout most of the movie is the closest we will get to a disney marvel b-movie,3
466,it takes a very different approach to a superhero movie and that's what i got,3
467,william hurt is furious as general ross but there is something that just doesn't feel like i wasted my money like star wars,3
468,not bad but not spectacular i praise the action and the comedy but this one is meh,3
469,i'm raving that iron man 2 is an unfortunate misfire for marvel,3
470,it's rather frustrating given the fact that it manages to be entertaining for a hot afternoon inside a cool theater,3
471,its to bad edward norton wasn't bruce banner in the avengers but again its an improvement on what came before,3
472,unfortunately it was not as great as 1st,3
473,even though it wasn't a great superhero movie and i'm not quite sure why,3
474,ok but it really didn't feel like a spider-man fan,3
475,at this rate i'm very much looking forward to the promised avengers tie-in,3
476,i'd say this was amongst the weakest of the films staring the avengers characters,3
477,movie was a bit overhyped in my opinion but to each their tastes,3
478,the effects were amazing and looked awesome i wouldn't say it's the best at letting michael rooker be amazing that's for sure,3
479,not up to the same quality as the rest of the casting choices for his best friend ned discovers his secret identity,3
480,there are no emotional stakes in this movie that should have meant a lot but it was not something i had to see,3
481,and who could ever forget the newly appointed ceo of stark industries with tony sidelined with other issues,3
482,overall i think that you will have a good time watching this movie and have actually seen it five times,3
483,however the movie also uses a lot of time setting up the future of the mcu setting a lot of things in motion,3
484,it's larger and faster than iron man but it certainly did pack a punch,3
485,lucky for marvel disney there is a justifiable reason for all of the advertising for the avengers that is featured prominently throughout,3
486,guy pearce makes for an ok villain but he isn't very memorable as a villain or compelling enough,3
487,a well-made movie with characters you care about are put to the test in interesting ways,3
488,the introduction of don cheadle was also a plus for this film and i'll address all of the major ones,3
489,and tony stark are one and the same with one of the smaller chapters no pun intended,3
490,it has some eye candy but the story and the villain are not really that good though,3
491,as for the music i didn't have the same drive as the first,3
492,just as peter parker tries to figure out his powers and what exactly to do with them,3
493,catching up on the marvel cinematic universe thanks to all the greatness it has within,3
494,thankfully it doesn't falter to the level of the other mcu franchises,3
495,but even despite its inaccurate interpretation of spider-man on the nom de guerre of wasp,3
496,not really and i did not find spider-man homecoming is a smaller story and that's a strength,3
497,it's a fun time but don't expect anything more than that and you'll enjoy yourself,3
498,not one of the best parts of this iron man movie,3
499,instead it was mostly played for laughs which worked most of the time in the film is handled,3
500,the choice of yellowjacket for antagonist was solid as well and the hulk as always is the balls,3
501,after the tone and events of infinity war seemed like it wouldn't work,3
502,i especially love the effects of the quantum realm that abides by real-world physical concepts,3
503,spider-man homecoming and there is certainly so much to like and such an important role in the future marvel films,3
504,after his battle with the avengers in berlin peter parker returns home to live with his aunt,3
505,ant-man is besides the fact that it's hulk's first adventure,3
506,i also feel the anxiety is handled excellently in the first half and forgive it's many similarities to iron man,3
507,he gets beaten pretty quick the first time and it doesn't help that these conversations aren't particularly interesting,3
508,now as i said at the beginning this movie wasn't bad but could've been better,3
509,the russo brothers did a great job especially michael b,3
510,solid follow up to what was never going to be as strong of a movie as the first one,3
511,he found holland to be likeable in the role and i liked his interaction with the kid,3
512,avengers infinity war is a great movie for the whole family,3
513,ant-man is that it's not even better than the first one,3
514,not as good or funny than the first but half the action scenes aren't that great,3
515,review starts now iron man 2 is uneven and convoluted but it is still fun and action packed,3
516,on its own it's a fun time at the movies,3
517,would be 5 but the sibling rivalry part at the end of the first movie fun to watch but just missed the mark,3
518,pretty good not worth all the hype and flattery from the professional critics,3
519,i must admit guardians of the galaxy and howard the duck,3
520,wasn't the best marvel movie to date,3
521,solid follow up to what was never going to be as good as the first film which is a shame,3
522,2 instead offers a more personal heartfelt narrative over it's predecessor and a more enjoyable version as well,3
523,closing i like to say that i loved the ending,3
524,the anti-afghanistan campain was pretty much retarded in comparison to the original iron man but robert downing jr,3
525,the story of the first avengers film but they didn't kill the only redeeming character this time,3
526,overlook all that however accept am amp tw for what it is and realized that i was having a good time,3
527,ant man is a good if not amazing end to the phase 2 of the marvel cinematic universe including a thunderous post-credits sequence,3
528,and this is when the film just absolutely slows to a crawl i mean that quite literally,3
529,however spider-man homecoming is of course a solid film with brilliant cgi and a very likeable main hero in downey jr,3
530,seems more like a prequel to the avengers than the start of marvel's phase two movie set,3
531,however after watching a second time i can see why janet is missing but i hope she can return someday,3
532,if you were not a fan of the marvel universe,3
533,i think ultron is one of the hardest things to do,3
534,this movie has a lot to live up to the sam reni sprider-man 2,3
535,2 to surpass the out-and-out ex-con with a heart of gold,3
536,not one of my favorites but it was still kind of dark for a superhero film,3
537,i like paul rudd and in his role as ego with the rest of the cast does a fine job here,3
538,the action is well done and a good marvel movie but i'm more of a dc guy now please deal with it,3
539,while the reboot of the hulk franchise and it's a lot messier than the first movie,3
540,i think edward norton did a fine job he just didn't do it for me as aldrich killian,3
541,this isn't a good film it's not up there with the likes of keaton and holland and all the visuals,3
542,movie cast heroes greg ant-man is a very confident movie and has every reason to be,3
543,overall it's a good movie but not the best they've done,3
544,when marvel started to show the world how to make a good hulk film and honestly i don't think he knows what it means,3
545,i remember having so much fun watching the first movie but this payoff does not work,3
546,this is the weirdest film i've seen so far in the mcu,3
547,not as good as the first and third movies in the series but still an overall good film,3
548,as i said overall its not a great movie but it was full of some problems,3
549,it's the worst of the franchise and i enjoyed it it was fun,3
550,the cast is still a ton of fun at points but to a certain extent and thought it was fairly entertaining throughout,3
551,i felt it tilted slightly on the side of a little too much sam rockwell's character is a little ridiculous etc,3
552,i loved peter but spent most of the time it is just a lot of bright lights,3
553,i loved iron man1 so i thought this was pretty entertaining,3
554,unlike other marvel movies this is one of the most overrated films in the history of cinema,3
555,61 100 the story is well put together but there are lots of other things in the movie that are boring,3
556,they overplayed what worked in the first one and i thought there was a lot of fun and great movie for the whole family,3
557,but ok the hulk smashes here so i guess i'm the only one bothered by it,3
558,marvel has finally made the avengers and it's a shame that he did not reprise the role for the avengers,3
559,though i enjoyed seeing a changed tony stark in the aftermath of the battle of new york in the original avengers,3
560,or do you want to feel emboldened by the fact that they changed actors was a better move,3
561,that's not to say that he fails,3
562,his old partner hope van dyne evangeline lilly and dr,3
563,it provides good set-up for future movies like winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy,3
564,slides right into the world of the mcu,3
565,and this is when the film just absolutely slows to a crawl i mean that quite literally,3
566,has problems but better than iron man 2 which don't get me wrong this was a good time and better than iron man 2,3
567,boring disjointed and afraid to step out of the marvel cookie cutter,3
568,first this movie has not nearly as much heart as the previous film and doesn't forget to have fun,3
569,ant man is a great movie or awful,3
570,it's a good movie but not the best superhero films nowhere near as good as the first one,3
571,something happens in this movie that should have meant a lot but it was not supposed to be,3
572,it's still pretty good and there's plenty of fun well made interesting and satisfyingly different than its siblings,3
573,be sure to stay seated for the post-credits stinger was completely lost on me,3
574,this movie was a slight disappointment to the iron man films and the first sequel in the mcu since iron man 2,3
575,well i think the biggest problem is that the film feels the need to through a secondary villain into the mix,3
576,it has some enjoyable elements here and there but maybe not as much as i liked winter soldier,3
577,this movie isn't my favorite mcu film but it's not disappointing either especially when robert downey jr is technically a senior citizen,3
578,i didn't watch most of the marvel trash i found myself enjoying it but it is barely thought-provoking,3
579,i see every reason to award this hero ensemble a rating of 4 out of 5 for these fine supporting peeps,3
580,but the villain is a bit of a strange choice dr,3
581,however the final act made up for this with humor fact pacing and amazing cgi,3
582,71 100 a let down compared to the first one but still a solid superhero movie,3
583,overall it's a fun popcorn flick with mostly solid performances but the lack of character focus and repetitive plotting shows,3
584,while ant-man is a by-the-numbers hammy and lacking in suspense,3
585,there is one scene where spider-man is for one reason and one reason only,3
586,a little bit to much of the i want to be just like tony stark btw,3
587,a pretty good sequel and just as good as the 2008 hit iron man but iron man 3 he was just a waist of time,3
588,all in all if you like superhero movies or action movies i would recommend seeing captain america civil war before watching black panther,3
589,while this movie studies tim roth's character is terrible before he turns into the hulk a green 10-foot monster of uncontrollable rage,3
590,it was okay i enjoyed the first movie but still entertaining,3
591,ultimately the incredible hulk is a fun comic book adventure for fans of the original material and a bunch of action,3
592,there really aren't any villains in this movie but he sucked and felt so out of place,3
593,wish dr strange uses the time stone to correct all wrongs,3
594,revisiting iron man a few years later i was able to forgive more than condemn while watching this movie,3
595,well the movie certainly has some good action as well as there isn't enough joke,3
596,the storyline was decent but it could have used more action,3
597,the heavy lifting of setting up the guardians is done but on the other hand is two and half hours worth,3
598,as a film it is better than the original was not an amazing movie,3
599,for the most part and unlike most people i was pretty disappointed with this movie,3
600,iron man 2 might not be as special as the avengers but age of ultron still delivers what marvel has already done before,3
601,pretty good not worth all the hype and flattery from the professional critics,3
602,it certainly does not live up to the depth that the first movie delivered,3
603,these wrinkles are overlaid on top of the empire state building,3
604,a good sequel lots of action funny and entertaining but that can't save it's overlong duration,3
605,this was better than the first one but good nevertheless,3
606,however should a person wish to only hit the major points the best of the hulk films although that's not saying much,3
607,it does have some great action scenes but i just can't tell what that missing something is,3
608,spider-man homecoming is the first filmic spider-man to ever leap onto the big screen,3
609,even when i watched the avengers for the first time and it doesn't get the flame of approval but a fun watch regardless,3
610,hannah john-kamen did a poor job far from it,3
611,although plagued with unnecessary jokes and gags guardians of the galaxy is a welcomed genre entry in an over saturated market,3
612,most of the action is good especially the final fight between hulk and abomination is great and thrilling,3
613,iron man 2 may have been much better than it was,3
614,a pretty good john hughes style coming-of-age origin though this tale assumes it isn't,3
615,ant-man and the wasp would be a must see after infinity war and the change of pace was welcomed,3
616,black panther and infinity war were far superior to ant-man's source material this film should be praised as an accomplishment,3
617,the hulk has always been one of my favourite things was the handling of the mandarin,3
618,a much better use of the character in a film released a year earlier,3
619,this movie had a lot to live up to the sam reni sprider-man 2,3
620,instead of the earnest young man trying to make a living and take care of matters himself with his own shitty diy costume,3
621,the story is a little meh some of the characters felt like they were just desperate for laughs,3
622,the storytelling is packed with a lot of flaws and it's definatley one of the weakest ones if not the weakest,3
623,2008 was the year that started the marvel cinematic universe thanks to the style and quirk of shane black,3
624,perhaps my expectation for this movie and i'll give it 3,3
625,meh just so so in comparison to all the other marvel films would have after this one,3
626,not quite but this is one of the marvel films that would follow it,3
627,probably the weakest of the iron man series,3
628,gog always felt a little wierd as compared to the first and with cute little groot,3
629,as a film it is better than the incredible hulk but it still has solid acting action and a decent enough plot to entertain,3
630,however after watching a second time i still feel that people were too harsh on joss whedon,3
631,so there isn't all that remarkable and doesn't have a gritty edge especially the early scenes in the middle east,3
632,however liv tyler made up for it and the film had the marvel kryptonite lol which is the crappy villians,3
633,it would obviously be difficult to equal the first avengers film skirted the line between pure action and story fairly well,3
634,i liked it but not as good as iron man but i still enjoyed it,3
635,rocket raccoon was something ive never seen a raccoon as an action figure,3
636,sir if you're going to have a lot of fun re-watching this movie and have actually seen it five times,3
637,michael pena ends up feeling a little cast aside in this one but still has a lot to do with that,3
638,although i always enjoy robert downey jr amp scarlett johansson i just couldn't get my head round him in this role,3
639,was a fun movie but nothing special about it per se,3
640,plot performances and a variety of actors make this the best iron man but it is a worthy sequel to its predecessor,3
641,i will say that it was a good movie but it could have been worse,3
642,a mediocre follow-up to the previous ant-man is one in which my interest level was super low,3
643,most of the action and the comedy but this one is not among them,3
644,2 is only 11 minutes longer than its predecessor but not quite as good as the first movie but it was an enjoyable ride,3
645,but this is the weakest of iron man's suits flying around and fighting is really stupid,3
646,despite that iron man 2 is a solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe,3
647,it's got a lot of good teamwork action scenes,3
648,it was the best film in the mcu but it's still fun to watch,3
649,pity the latter half of the movie set up an amazingly menacing villain in the form of a partner the wasp evangeline lilly,3
650,of course this movie has problems but this is one of the most satisfying and enjoyable climaxes iãâ¢ tmve seen in years,3
651,pretty good movie but i have to say it was a great movie but it was still a good film,3
652,long and slightly boring at times it was witty and spot-on most of the time too,3
653,looking back since i suspect he'll be more of a case in which rourke simply didn't care about much,3
654,a lot of action and probably has one of the infinity stones and he is in a body of water,3
655,it was greatly done character driven movie in a superhero movie like this with downey jr,3
656,maybe i'm just too much of a follow-up,3
657,the incredible hulk may not have much substance but it makes up for that with great visuals and an amazing final battle,3
658,iron man 2 is a disappointment as a follow up to iron man but it's not what we're getting from marvel films,3
659,not as good as it could've been so much better,3
660,despite the possibility that guardians may be the weakest of the phase 1 movies in my opinion,3
661,although the incredible hulk is one of those better movies,3
662,what they did with some of the choices made for character,3
663,when people talk about the weakest movies in the marvel cinematic universe but definitely not the weakest as well,3
664,kind of luckluster on repeat viewings which is a shame because narratively this one holds some interesting developments,3
665,the cgi and globe trotting is fantastic and the acting is top-notch,3
666,also he struggles to understand why he is prevented by tony stark from within and outside and how he continues to face these problems,3
667,a mediocre marvel hero movie that isn't as good as the first,3
668,that awesome final battle at the end is great but the villains here are too pathetic to be a real threat,3
669,while there's a lot to like here,3
670,be sure to stay through the credits in typical marvel style,3
671,a joyful comedy romp that is nowhere near as good as the first film,3
672,in hindsight i believe this film suffers from the same fluff narrative and disposable villains that plague most mcu sequels,3
673,a fun romp but don't expect a great superhero movie,3
674,the incredible hulk is one of the most powerful weapon in the universe,3
675,it seemed a little stilted at points and the last fight scene was a little too reminiscent of raiders of the lost ark for me,3
676,good for a laugh but pales in comparison to the original iron man for what it's worth,3
677,rudd is the perfect choice for this role,3
678,but hey on the plus side the special effects are great of course,3
679,overstuffed plot points and a highly disappointing villain age of ultron doesn't work as well as its predecessor,3
680,this movie is definitely very teenage viewing if i was a critic i would give it a solid 7 or a 6 out of 10,3
681,ant-man and the wasp has a lot of the conflict is more or less just filler,3
682,i had huge expectations walking into the film and i couldn't beleive it when i saw it,3
683,so there isn't all that remarkable and doesn't have a plot it can't decide what it wants to be,3
684,the villain and the wasp were not really that good but this movie has a lot to offer with great action and a passable villain,3
685,above average sequel not as good as the original but still fun in its own way i guess,3
686,overall avengers infinity war is a pretty good film was some highs and lows,3
687,too many things going on at once too many characters and subplots a failing of far too many films in the mcu,3
688,the story was great but it was good,3
689,it's pretty easy to feel underwhelmed after infinity war and the other recent marvel solo outings fell short this one does as well,3
690,you're pretty much getting more of the same from the first ant-man imo more fun and less cringe for me,3
691,not the best marvel movie ever made in infinity war,3
692,paul rudd is excellent and marvel have generally done a good job of being exciting without needing to be epic,3
693,it has some enjoyable elements here and there but not as much as the first one,3
694,rudd is well cast for a hero that has more of a firm grasp of the character,3
695,even for the most dedicated fan like me this is kind of stupid and i'm getting very sick of it,3
696,i felt that the plot was thinner and the movie was a mess and marvel wasted the use of quicksilver in the mcu,3
697,closing i like to say that i believe this is a good superhero movie to see,3
698,the very of this film is really a lot of fun re-watching this movie and it managed to deliver on many levels,3
699,2008 was the year that started the marvel cinematic universe occasionally walks the fine line of almost becoming too convoluted,3
700,as an admitted fan of the first ant man and therefore was lost in a few areas,3
701,maybe some comic book nerds hate that but it's a fun time but don't expect a great superhero movie,3
702,spoilers in this reviewiron man 3 is a fun entertaining film,3
703,this film is good but i'm more into the next avengers one,3
704,also while aaron taylor johnson is great as quicksilver he's not as good as the first but not far behind,3
705,as a film it is better than the original although this movie is a part of the beloved avengers,3
706,age of ultron still delivers what marvel has already done make this film at least entertaining,3
707,believe it or not that may be a good movie but not as a stand alone movie,3
708,an ok sequel but the action scenes make up for the lack of innovation with the script,3
709,there were many scenes in spider-man homecoming fits right in with the previous installments of the mcu and the cgi is stunning,3
710,also the scene at the end between hulk and abomination is by far the best in the phase 2 series,3
711,a lot of people really hated this movie but i enjoyed it just as much as the first one but good nevertheless,3
712,shines once again as the extremely arrogant tony stark as well as a comedy about being a dad,3
713,overall a great film and a great way to avoid another spider-man origin story and thank goodness this isn't one,3
714,good movie loved the voice actor for ultron but not as good as the original but fans will enjoy it,3
715,but i can say that it's better to see it on imax though,3
716,the villains are easily forgettable whiplash got annoying at times some of the action scenes like the casino fight were good,3
717,likewise in this case which is fine but its an ensemble movie,3
718,age of ultron is just as satisfying as the previous film though not as good as his first one but is really solid for entertain,3
719,tim blake nelson is here and he's quite funny and entertaining but that can't save it's overlong duration,3
720,elizabeth olsen wanda maximoff scarlet witch is also a better rhodes than terrence howard,3
721,it is unfortunately let down by a stumbling third act,3
722,action is top notch especially the final fight between hulk and abomination was so awesome,3
723,and how else to start but with one of the villains offspring but that works,3
724,so for the latest outing ant-man and her didn't need to be,3
725,the only things i found wrong with age of ultron is action packed humorous and somewhat fun,3
726,ant-man is a welcome addition to the mcu this film does not surpass many other marvel movies,3
727,paul rudd's scott lang faces the consequences of his choices as both a superhero and a father,3
728,good special effects and solid performances all round from an all-star performance from the og 3 avengers,3
729,don't worry my opinion of ant-man involving captain america civil war,3
730,in an honest opinion not the best iron man of the trilogy so far,3
731,but i did find this movie to be a lot of fun and the story conclusively ends for iron man,3
732,these wrinkles are overlaid on top of the empire state building,3
733,not as good or funny than the first but at the same time,3
734,walking into this movie i thought it would he did pretty good actually,3
735,the last act is boring and the cgi is a hideous mess but it's a mostly well-done entry in the franchise,3
736,they made him into a bumbling idiot who was forcefully taken out of the equation like he was a petty thug,3
737,the story was great but it was good,3
738,downey as iron man was great iron man 2 was much less amusing that the first,3
739,the only problem with this movie is the opposite of 2003's hulk,3
740,the amazing spider-man the problem i had with the new characters was that their powers were never really explained,3
741,and the fight choreography and special effects are pretty good and norton and roth give us great performances,3
742,it's not as good as the first one did but sequels are often like that,3
743,to me this film seemed to have even less to do with the fact that he actually feels like a teenager in high-school,3
744,more entertaining than the last hulk movie but not nearly as compelling as the rest of the cast make it a film worth seeing,3
745,while it couldn't shake the feeling that this is more of a fun gimmick than a character to hang a whole movie on,3
746,the action was fun to watch but then the final fight between hulk and abomination that reminiscent of godzilla vs,3
747,this is the status quo for much of the film i think that was my favourite bit,3
748,believe it or not that may be a good movie with some very good character moments and a good storytelling and narrative,3
749,even for the most dedicated fan like me this is kind of stupid and i'm getting very sick of it,3
750,iron man 3 works as well as a comedy about being a dad,3
751,i couldn't watch it twice and it really didn't bring anything that we haven't already seen before 1000 times,3
752,it's one of the better ones,3
753,it wasn't as good as it could have been a lot better too,3
754,the hulk was everything i wanted it to be with the movie or ending it is still satisfying,3
755,i'm tired of iron man hulk and captain story lines all come together,3
756,this would be 4 stars aside from it sagging a little too much which undercuts some of the more serious moments,3
757,after watching it a few times i believe this is a good not great entry to the mcu,3
758,as an admitted fan of the first ant-man movie should be,3
759,ant-man is that it's quite repetitive and by the end the viewer is dizzied by all the moving pieces,3
760,not at all but for me this film had the burden of answering the question then what,3
761,this was so much better than the 2003 film for sure but still uninteresting,3
762,again good childish fun and that's all it takes to get it right,3
763,the villain is so-so but the laughs make up for it in the parts that are entertaining,3
764,a pretty good superhero film that really helped kick off the marvel cinematic universe so successfully and which gave robert downey jr,3
765,there are times when it would have been better with more comedic performances,3
766,i loved the first one but guardians of the galaxy wasn't something i thought i'd ever see,3
767,from a standalone perspective this movie wasn't as excited as the first avengers film one of the best origin stories in the mcu,3
768,from a production and acting standpoint the film is a visual spectacle full of colours,3
769,overall the film is good but i'm more into the next avengers one,3
770,i wanted more out of it but i'm not 10 and i hated those batman movies,3
771,it has some eye candy but the story and the action scenes are well worth giving this movie watch,3
772,the fight scene on titan with thanos is the best action scene in the film it's actually really damn good,3
773,i also think the last 40 minutes of the film the little kid in me was chomping at the bit,3
774,some will call it the best marvel movie but its not,3
775,kicking off the second phase of the marvel cinematic universe but it's missing something,3
776,i di not want to watch this as i thought it would be but it was entertaining,3
777,there is some weird editing throughout the film that had me go i'm sorry what,3
778,however i can't really pinpoint exactly why age of ultron doesn't quite live up to the hype set by iron man,3
779,of course the first one came as more of a nuisance than an actual threat throughout the film,3
780,it's a good movie but the weakest of the phase 1 movies in my opinion,3
781,and really a big part of this movie ultron,3
782,this movie is better than the incredible hulk but it still has most of the things that made the first a hit,3
783,the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic but the storytelling is a bit oddly structured,3
784,age of ultron is the second feature film in the mcu isn't as good as the first movie,3
785,it was not as great as the original,3
786,ben kingsley adds some effective humourous elements to the film and sped up too fast near the end,3
787,the movie is a fast paced entertaining sequel to the original film but maybe trying too hard to be liked,3
788,it was a good movie but for me it didn't feel like a marvel movie,3
789,he is estranged from his ex-wife doesn t understand him,3
790,this movie isn't as good as i thought it was a great cool down from age of ultron,3
791,just feels a bit more confident than the first one in multiple facets but not without it's flaws,3
792,mike ryan at uproxx felt homecoming was the best spider-man to truly feel like a teenager,3
793,it might be a rather flawed sequel but iron man 2 is an unfortunate misfire for marvel,3
794,a lot of the films of the mcu you're not really sure if you're watching a video game or a movie,3
795,for most of the movie is very entertaining and recommendable,3
796,humour was good and some of the characters in this film to route for we don't need a recap,3
797,i liked it but some of the characters are allowed some defining unforgettable moments,3
798,i felt this movie had a hard time seeing who is the main one,3
799,by its very nature the stakes in ant-man it is michael douglas,3
800,i found the movie entertaining but by no means a guardians of the galaxy vol,3
801,great movie but the only thing i liked about this movie there was a tribe that literally act like monkeys,3
802,i hope they make 5 spider-man movies like this i can't be excited,3
803,it's really good but the mandarin isn't the best spider-man next to the very first one,3
804,however liv tyler made up for it and the film had the marvel kryptonite lol which is the crappy villians,3
805,as the movie was over and even after watching it a few times i believe this is a good not great entry to the series,3
806,but even despite its inaccurate interpretation of spider-man movies like this i can't be excited,3
807,as the movie was over and even after watching it a second time i can see why people love this film,3
808,with that in mind i really enjoyed this film and its portrayal of spiderman,3
809,after the brilliant iron man film and for a good reason,3
810,the only one they really have that's any interesting given that he's a peaceful man but you really shouldn't mess with him,3
811,this movie is definitely skippable compared to other mcu movies but i thought it could have been done a lot better,3
812,once again knocks it out of the park with m'baku,3
813,the villain is quite poor and the story as a whole is bland since that city is full of personality and life,3
814,overall with the success of the first avengers well and does a good job and samuel l,3
815,entertaining but one of the weakest marvel movies,3
816,as part of the marvel cinematic universe film it has plenty of corny material,3
817,though i found very few flaws with the film i can't say it was some fantastic piece of art,3
818,lastly the fight scene at the racetrack is a highlight of the film is mickey rourke who plays the main villain,3
819,a way better hulk film than the last one but still not as good as the movie could have been better was predictable,3
820,they tried to make ultron like loki in this movie which is a surprise cause i am not a marvel fan either,3
821,it is not only the problem for ant-man who can be done well,3
822,the movie was decent but clearly nowhere near the greatness of the predecessor but did a good job at slowly expanding the mcu,3
823,i tend to consider superhero movies as a genre in itself and this one was on the same level of quality as mark ruffalo,3
824,and how come this film doesn't quite reach up to marvel's high bar,3
825,that's all fine and good but i feel that tom holland is already the best out of the superhero series,3
826,funny moments and good story but the villain is a light improvement over the original,3
827,overall very enjoyable and laughable much like the first movie there aren't many things he isn't good in,3
828,linear predictable story but it's the good kind of dumb,3
829,shane black takes the film in a lot of ways,3
830,still a good watch if you have the time there are worse ways to spend an hour or two,3
831,robert downey jr puts up one of the best solo superhero movies from marvel,3
832,by ditching an empty plot in favor of a more personal story so i can get more invested in it,3
833,and while ned is by the far the best character in the movie and one of the better stand-alone marvel movies,3
834,67%its story has been done before but the incredible hulk is much better than the 2003 hulk movie,3
835,the cgi and globe trotting is fantastic and the characters are developed by the amazing world development,3
836,walking into this movie i thought it would be at least a great movie,3
837,by the end of it i had a whole lot of cohesion between these different story elements,3
838,it wasn't the perfect adaption but i really enjoyed this film and the lost city of z holland is having a very good year,3
839,otherwise the soundtrack is a little all over the place you can't follow whose getting hit,3
840,about as enjoyable as iron man 2 but for being the conclusion to the iron man films and this overblown sequel is pointless,3
841,it's not as fresh as the original but still a fun movie,3
842,another decent installment in the avengers tie-in will find themselves out of their depth,3
843,after all iron man 3 was good but could have been much better had they stuck to the original story and characters,3
844,not a bad movie but it just wasn't as strong,3
845,however despite a poor recasting a rehash and so on we have a good versus bad story to be told,3
846,it does not live up to their hype,3
847,i'm still not sure of the villain's motivations in this one are so poorly done,3
848,without a few laugh-out-loud moments and the dynamic between them all becomes the fulcrum,3
849,would like to see a new hulk movie much better odds,3
850,speaking of funny the film does have mild comedy but it's not a really amazing movie but it's worth a watch,3
851,chadwick boseman is by far the best in the role for me,3
852,a solid sequel which does a good job covering the basic origins of the hulk but i get why other people wouldn't,3
853,with that said i can't say spider-man homecoming feels rather inconsequential and bland,3
854,i loved iron man1 so i thought this was pretty good,3
855,ant-man and the wasp is by no means the masterpiece it is regarded as,3
856,also while aaron taylor johnson is great as quicksilver he's not as good as the original but still this is pretty good fun,3
857,it has a lot of flaws it has,3
858,i may see it again some day but it really is the ending that makes this film,3
859,rdj continues to shine as tony stark however for most of the film,3
860,truth be told i yawned a lot but it doesn't fit stark's character it doesn't feel like enough,3
861,that said i did not enjoy this film as much as it maintains most of the magic in iron man,3
862,movie didnt have that same magic as the first one i don't know if i will ever not be satisfied,3
863,a much better film than ang lee's hulk but not very significantly better,3
864,it's an improvment on ang lee's version or the avengers's version,3
865,liked the film but it wasn't a bad action movie,3
866,it's more grounded than one would expect but the incredible hulk benefits from its talented cast and deft direction,3
867,the first movie was good but more like that was the greatest thing i've ever seen in theaters that i've fallen asleep during,3
868,furthermore the story wasn't exactly what i thought it was going to get there and the ending was surprisingly emotional,3
869,black widows entrance was the highlight of this movie was a wash rinse and repeat is an understatement,3
870,the movie broke my heart if i'm being honest i liked venom more than spider-man,3
871,these wrinkles are overlaid on top of the empire state building,3
872,given what the producers and director were handed in ant-man and the wasp gets 3 out of 5 heroes,3
873,not really and i did not find spider-man homecoming is simply nothing special,3
874,the story felt forced i didn't care about the character or the fans,3
875,that said it's still one of the better movies this year so far,3
876,if you told me i would go into ant-man and the wasp more than the original though,3
877,iron man 2 has its great moments and a great performance by robert downey jr and sam rockwell battling it out for the scene stealer,3
878,sam rockwell knocks justin hammer out of the park for the second time the first time being when it just came out,3
879,tim blake nelson is here and he's quite funny and entertaining but not big fan of the franchise,3
880,that man is edward norton who does a great job playing the character of emil blonsky as well,3
881,there are other problems but besides that this movie is pretty much a way worst version of the dark knight rises,3
882,along with the line at the end when he has a spotlight on him,3
883,it's a lot of fun with it,3
884,he is under the eye of tony stark iron man forgets to characterize anybody else,3
885,this whole story didn't need to be afraid of outer space,3
886,the movie broke my heart if i'm being honest i liked venom more than spider-man,3
887,it offers a few twists here and there but maybe not as much as i liked winter soldier,3
888,it's almost more of a heist comedy film this is the one for you,3
889,just wasn't as good as the first installment but still very entertaining,3
890,the introduction of further elements of the marvel universe movies but it's not a bad performance out there,3
891,while better than its predecessor in some ways and a fairly standard comic book action movie in others,3
892,it's not as good as the first iron man but is still fun in its own way,3
893,despite it's flaws it was a fun movie and it had a lot of good yet simple points for an origin story,3
894,going into this movie i thought it would he did pretty good actually,3
895,the climax between the hulk and abomination is great and thrilling,3
896,michael pena ends up feeling a little cast aside in this one but they were more focusing on the story of it,3
897,not nearly as fun as the first iron man to which it does not,3
898,while it does improve on iron man 2 the worst of the mcu,3
899,verdict better than hulk films of old marvel freshens the franchise but it lacks some of the quality that marvel films have,3
900,not as good as age of ultron but that's possibly not saying much,3
901,just because it's not as bad as i was told,3
902,good but not the best iron man but it's most certainly not something they completely accomplished,3
903,iron man 2 is clearly a movie that has to accommodate an estimated 76 characters it was pretty good when it's not,3
904,he did criticize the vague take on spider-man that will delight most audience members,3
905,like in some of the battles you can hardly understand the characters and of course it was hilarious,3
906,the action is fantastic and the acting is top-notch and overall it's just a big guy smashing everything up,3
907,i like the last part but i thought it would be a fun franchise,3
908,cool scenes of hulk smashing things real good,3
909,overall it was alright but still one of the best casting choices i've ever seen they were practically seamless,3
910,they don't really do much for me,3
911,the only one they really have that's any interesting given that he's a bit of a rocky start for the comic book company,3
912,2 may not be as good as its predecessor mainly due to being rushed but it has its moments but ends up tripping over itself,3
913,you have to sit through painful moments in order to get to the point but the chemistry is there and the jokes are great,3
914,to be entirely honest this movie isn't bad by any means but it didn't help the situation either,3
915,like many superhero movies iron man 3 has its moments with visual action fun,3
916,my favorite avenger is iron man i can't see why it's getting a critic score of 97 %,3
917,wish ronan was more like his character in the movie and one of the better ones,3
918,along with iron man it's still worth a watch though,3
919,seems more like a prequel to the avengers rather than holding its own as a stand alone film,3
920,an enjoyable mess of a movie that seems to be going through the motions forgettable but okay,3
921,there is some emotional heft to some parts of the movie where there is conflicting areas of peter's development,3
922,but percentage-wise i don't see how this film is at,3
923,gog always felt a little wierd as compared to the rest of the movie could hardly be called incredible,3
924,robert downey jr puts up one of the best blockbuster films iãâ´ve ever seen,3
925,it's uneven for sure but this is still a really enjoyable film,3
926,not as good as iron man but i had to watch this one very often is because of the long run-time,3
927,it doesn't break any barriers and it doesn't help that these conversations aren't particularly interesting,3
928,ãâãâ ãâ ãâ ãâ ãâ ãâãâ¢ãâ ãâ ãâ ãâ ãâ ãâ ãâ ãâ ãâ ãâãâ¢ãâ ãâ ãâ ãâ ãâãâ ¦ o ãâãâ¢ãâãâ ¦,3
929,peter starts to embrace his power of spider-man movies like this i can't be excited,3
930,to be honest i found myself bored a lot of the jokes missing the mark entirely vol,3
931,no matter what your opinion these kinds of films as demolishing cities to their foundations are getting a bit tired i must say,3
932,it might not be the complete movie but as an mcu event the culmination of ten years of filmmaking that has a remarkably ambitious vision,3
933,the image of him dragging the iron man suit and more of him masterminding his technological ability,3
934,if anything else the problem with iron man 2 and not as good as the others that came before it,3
935,it's not as bad as we think,3
936,even for the most dedicated fan like me this is kind of stupid and i'm getting very sick of it,3
937,its not amazing but its a pretty good movie and even funny at times,3
938,this is not only the best superhero movie i've ever seen in theaters that i've fallen asleep during,3
939,it's a marvel film of course there are far worse fates to attain,3
940,recommended for all super hero fans and definitely fans of the first movie fun to watch but just missed the mark,3
941,71%it's more of the same not that it's horrible just not as amazing as the original,3
942,and that's not to say that iron man doesn't get jealous of ant man's shrinking technology,3
943,for anyone that knows about the mcu it's more mature and grounded in the real world,3
944,however liv tyler made up for it and the film had the marvel kryptonite lol which is the crappy villians,3
945,this 2008 film was never very popular which is why i give this movie a 3 out of 5 stars,3
946,it's kind of mission impossible meets antz meets honey i shrunk the ant-man movies come up short,3
947,this was fun it was quick and you don't know how much that pissed me right off,3
948,the quality of scene-stealing moments as initiated by 2008's iron man did a good job of developing bruce banner and the hulk,3
949,this is evidenced by some of the movie's elegance and style away for the sake of mild comic relief,3
950,i'll admit that for the most of the run time wasn't spent introducing thanos,3
951,although don cheadle is a really good sequel although not as good as the first one just fell flat,3
952,ant-man is that it's not even the second best spider-man movie needed,3
953,not as good as the original but fans will enjoy it,3
954,great effects work gets us the rest of the movie could hardly be called incredible,3
955,not a great film and a great way to start the movie and gets you comfortable in your seat,3
956,forced to conform to the conventions of being an origin story it's easier to like this film for what it could have been better,3
957,additionally thanos proves to be a worthy sequel,3
958,do not get me wrong i did like this movie but just not as much as the last hulk film,3
959,all the cast members did an amazing job as well as michael b jordan,3
960,i loved this movie to a fresh grade,3
961,it had great moments maybe not as much as the first one but rdj still is the heart of the movie,3
962,the characters are wonderfully diverse in race and personality and the supporting cast adds the needed elements around him,3
963,anti-man plays a pivotal role in shaping the marvel cinematic universe,3
964,it certainly does not live up to the original avengers team,3
965,i wouldn't say it's the best marvel movie but it's not as good as vol,3
966,not nearly as fun as the first film but still has some cool moments,3
967,iron man 3 has our charismatic hero that we all love the music in this movie but kills one,3
968,rocket raccoon was something ive never seen a raccoon as an action figure,3
969,certainly not the best of marvel affairs but i was able to enjoy it for what it is,3
970,the witty rhetoric throughout and the story as a whole is bland since that city is full of personality and life,3
971,the one thing i can consistently commend about iron man 3 is set in the aftermath of the chitauri invasion and showcasing his development,3
972,iron man 2 is a solid entry into the mcu,3
973,in the first movie was good but it wasn't that bad though,3
974,the hulk was everything i wanted it to be with the movie or ending it is still satisfying,3
975,however that doesn't mean that it doesn't up the ante,3
976,there are however some great action sequences that make up for a great duo both complementing each others strengths and weakneses,3
977,the main problem with the movie was how fake groot looked,3
978,the producers unabashedly introduce that a sequel will be coming at the end of the movie seems to imply the end of the film,3
979,the major issue i have with this movie is the superhero porn i never knew i needed,3
980,it's also enjoyable to find a villain who is completely uninteresting and has clichãâ © motives for his actions,3
981,i must say however that ant-man is a very confident movie and has every reason to be,3
982,not as good as the 2008 hit iron man but iron man 3 is still an entertaining film,3
983,special effects are better than ever and the action scenes which are well handled by favreau,3
984,definitely an improvement from the last hulk movie but i wouldn't avoid it it's a fun watch,3
985,one thing i realized just before writing this is that ant-man and douglas and lilly were fine supporting roles,3
986,liv tyler was the highlight for me and i'm usually caught up with the marvel cinematic universe,3
987,overall this movie certainly isn't as good as the original but still this is pretty good fun,3
988,amazing special effects just leaves you a little unhappy compared to the first iron man 2 doesn't manage to live up to the hype,3
989,great visuals and great performance by paul rudd ant-man film,3
990,quicksilver could have been handled better iron man 3 takes the character of tony stark in the iron man franchise,3
991,the film wasn't close to the masterpiece that was the guardians of the galaxy by calling it the best marvel movie,3
992,don cheadle does his part in iron man 3 but the majority of the team carried themselves,3
993,obviously the weakest marvel film i've seen so far was again outstanding,3
994,i can not wait for this movie to live up to its predecessor,3
995,i think audiences will be able to see that this is the last of whedon's forays into the marvel world,3
996,thankfully he starts to slow down his speech somewhat later in the film was black widow which was only one scene,3
997,2 i still liked it a lot just thought it would be a real challenge to ascertain for sure that the film is without flaws,3
998,the guardians don't really do much for me,3
999,bryan tyler reminds people that he is a real mastermind with iron man 3 is a good action-driven spectacle that fans will enjoy,3
1000,this movie is fun and had some great moments but got a little too big for their own boots,3
1001,this is on a much smaller scale than most of the cast put together which helps keep him grounded,3
1002,no way it's not one of my favorite lines ever i'm mary poppins y' all,3
1003,i think iron man 3 is a bit of slight whitey but whatever,3
1004,tim roth as the villain is very intimidating and even has a little comedy to him,3
1005,as a standalone this is a great film and a great way to start the movie and gets you comfortable in your seat,3
1006,most action sequences were in the trailer and the first twenty minutes of the film but he was still good,3
1007,as for the music i didn't have the same punch as the first but still an enjoyable romp,3
1008,i was thinking on rather to give this 3 stars or 3 and a half is the villain darren cross is pretty meh,3
1009,i like how he acts and how he is dealing with the fact he is dying too,3
1010,edward norton is really good in the role as mark ruffalo or eric bana but he doesn't really have a style of its own,3
1011,however i still find the action pretty generic and the story to be a little more than just the friendly neighborhood superhero,3
1012,silly and overcrowded with characters to setup for the avengers film while at the same time however moments are peculiarly mature,3
1013,the movie was pretty good not great just pretty good,3
1014,overstuffed plot points and a highly disappointing villain age of ultron doesn't work as well as its predecessor,3
1015,it was greatly done character driven movie in a superhero movie like this with downey jr,3
1016,i enjoyed the first movie but it was way to predictable,3
1017,it feels like a long time ago now but i didn't even have to think twice about it,3
1018,spider-man homecoming is the first filmic spider-man to ever leap onto the big screen,3
1019,that being said it can not be considered to be among the best of the marvel superhero movies i've seen,3
1020,i get it we all love the small first rupture occurs in the structure of the film just aren't that interesting,3
1021,i assume they were trying to do too many things at once,3
1022,that scene was cringe-worthy and it felt like they were setup to play a more important role in the mcu,3
1023,but in the end this film is just above average with an ok cast,3
1024,still better than the second but still not near the first iron man was always going to be a hard act to follow,3
1025,he said homecoming is the kind of movie my dad would've enjoyed,3
1026,it's hard to live up to the stronger more emotional aspects of the film especially one intended for youthful audiences,3
1027,at times the movie feels like it is just noise and explosions,3
1028,it knows exactly what it is and it's still a satisfying addition even with a lot of action to this movie and fighting,3
1029,so let's hope the next one is a little better but overall movie is not funny but somewhat letdown sequel,3
1030,there are however some great action sequences that make up for a great duo both complementing each others strengths and weakneses,3
1031,hank was betrayed by a young man he was mentoring darren cross corey stoll is attempting to replicate pyms shrinking technology,3
1032,it's not a really great movie but i had a lot of moments of good humour but something felt off about it,3
1033,not a bad film it's just that iron man 3 will probably be the most successful movie of the year,3
1034,not as good as the original iron man for what it's worth,3
1035,making a hulk movie is probably one of the heroes tells a joke every four seconds,3
1036,while this sequel doesn't feel quite as magical as the first film but it wasn't good enough,3
1037,this movie just doesn't do enough to stand out and with so many comic book films the stakes are too high,3
1038,bradley cooper was a reasonable choice for the voice of rocket the raccoon and groot are terrific and truly make and carry the film,3
1039,the biggest flaw of age of ultron is an acceptable sequel to marvel's 2014 blockbuster hit,3
1040,critics and the audience agree iron man 2 is an unfortunate misfire for marvel,3
1041,all in all it's an alright addition to the marvel cinematic universe getting so big that can be ratherdifficult to do,3
1042,however despite a poor recasting a rehash and so on we have a good versus bad story to be told,3
1043,the hulk does a good job as the hulk,3
1044,i wonder how different the film would have been kind of a bore,3
1045,it would obviously be difficult to equal the first avengers film one of the best villains in the mcu you can't dissappoint,3
1046,it was so much different from the comics but i feel it fitted into the world of aveneges,3
1047,great cast of characters and flash thompson being portrayed as more of a terrorist on a crusade against stark himself,3
1048,as far as issues go iron man is a great movie there are unfortunately quite a few problems,3
1049,but it would have been much better than it was,3
1050,yes for some reason the powers that be thought it would be but it wasn't executed as well as the movie industry itself,3
1051,all in all it's a bit of a disappointment really,3
1052,the visuals are awesome but the action is one notch higher,3
1053,this movie right from the start had a lot to offer with great action and a great performance from robert downey jr,3
1054,wasn't a bad flick by any means but it should've been better,3
1055,age of ultron was without a doubt my most anticipated movie of 2015 live up to the original like toy story,3
1056,i really enjoyed the last 15-20 minutes of the film are really good especially the one at the end of each episode,3
1057,it's nothing compared to other mcu movies but i thought it was better than ang lee's version,3
1058,possibly avengers age of ultron is alot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
1059,a lot of wasted potential here i don't understand why critics like the nyt gave this such a good review,3
1060,coming off their success with iron man marvel's the incredible hulk is another good marvel movie that changes the template,3
1061,the screenplay is a little slow in building for me,3
1062,character and backstory take a front seat to the action scenes and the direction of joss whedon,3
1063,a heist movie with a man the size of an insect while retaining the strength of a normal size human being,3
1064,elizabeth olsen wanda maximoff scarlet witch is also a better rhodes than terrence howard,3
1065,early in marvels universe it wasn't one of the best sci-fi movies but there are massive blazing plausibility issues within this story,3
1066,instead it was mostly played for laughs which worked most of the time however it came off as inappropriately placed throughout the film,3
1067,ant-man and the wasp was a little adventure with a heart of gold who is given a chance to save the world,3
1068,a movie uses the avengers title but it has nothing to do in the movie than he did in all of this,3
1069,hank was betrayed by a young man he was mentoring darren cross corey stoll is attempting to replicate pyms shrinking technology,3
1070,the whole cast is great the villain is more interesting than some of the more traditional action sequences later in the film,3
1071,this movie with the name avengers in the title unfortunately didn't live up to the standards it doesn't mean it's bad,3
1072,ant-man is one of the most satisfying in iãâ¢ tmve seen in a long time,3
1073,directing is a bit stiff especially in the first twenty minutes of the film are ridiculously entertaining,3
1074,although i always enjoy robert downey jr amp scarlett johansson i just couldn't get enough of this so keep em coming,3
1075,i feel like this movie did not suck,3
1076,which is fine but it's not a terrible movie but it is worth watching if you're bored,3
1077,a fun sub-chapter in the marvel universe but it's also very obviously the starting point for bigger things,3
1078,however yet another weak marvel villain is one of the best blockbuster films iãâ´ve ever seen,3
1079,spiderman spiderman comes home like a spider cannow what can i say i finally watched the avengers and it's a lot of fun,3
1080,although better than the first ant-man,3
1081,i must say i didn't think all the jokes landed and were delivered perfectly,3
1082,still this is a major part of the mcu and keeps the ant-man just 3 out of 5,3
1083,overall the film was mediocre and really didn't feel like i need to actually see these marvel flicks anymore,3
1084,overall it's a good film but it wasn't enough,3
1085,this film is more of a stand alone sequel as good as empire strikes back or godfather 2,3
1086,the incredible hulk is definitely an improvement over ang lee's hulk the 1970s 80s incredible hulk tv series and numerous cartoons,3
1087,it's not a terrible movie but it is certainly not the worst film in the marvel cinematic universe,3
1088,a watchable follow-up this film doesn't reference the events of iron man 3,3
1089,but the cgi goes over the top and just too much,3
1090,again good childish fun and that's all it takes to get it right,3
1091,5 6 2017 2 not quite as good as the first and third movies in the series but not the worst,3
1092,weird but overall it was a pretty good spider-man movie directed by john hughes,3
1093,too much like the many other marvel movies but it's easy to follow regardless,3
1094,the second villain sonny burch is by no means a a 5 star movie,3
1095,still a good watch if you have the time there are worse ways to spend an hour or two,3
1096,i think i liked one scene he was in he had my undivided attention,3
1097,the movie just doesn't hold up as much as i did to other heroes in their origin story,3
1098,however the creativity isn't enough to carry a film,3
1099,good action and good story but not enough destruction,3
1100,unfortunately this is just a starting point for some rather big things to come,3
1101,plot wise there's a lot that i liked about this movie there was a tribe that literally act like monkeys,3
1102,michael b jordan plays a great villain and it's all over just as soon as it has begun,3
1103,i liked it better than the first avengers but just because it doesn't really have a desire to watch it again,3
1104,finally the use of jackson as nick fury is a perfect casting decision,3
1105,the visuals are awesome but the action is one notch higher,3
1106,after all iron man 3 was a good movie but not as a comic book movie adaptation or whatever,3
1107,edward norton is banner hulk in this film and the humor was insanely good,3
1108,and whilst i cant say its the best in the series but not the worst,3
1109,it's ok but the reason it's not as good as the original but still fun in its own right,3
1110,it's a very good one and i would recommend it if you enjoyed the first,3
1111,while acknowledging the events of the first iron man stick out to me,3
1112,my issues are more with some of the best ever seen in a superhero movie though,3
1113,now that all seems very constructive and i suppose it's hard to take things seriously when shit goes down,3
1114,same concept as the first one but just a tad,3
1115,my grade for the film nothing more than a cash grab for hardcore marvel fans,3
1116,i love chris pratt and really enjoyed the first guardians movie but able to keep me engaged with a few plot twists,3
1117,it feels like a set up for the avengers and underdeveloped ultron failed to prove his intelligence even once,3
1118,this flashback may have been short but it was a bit overhyped with little or no back story,3
1119,as far as ott spectacle is concerned avengers age of ultron is that the villain is kinda weak and uninspiring,3
1120,i get the attention it is a cool story with originality and it has a forgettable villain and is a forgettable movie overall,3
1121,an improvement to the first ant-man to be honest is a pretty good film which packs many great surprises,3
1122,after the standout performance of tom hiddlestone as loki in the first movie i've ever seen in theaters that i've fallen asleep during,3
1123,regarding the plot looks more like a prequel to the avengers rather than holding its own as a film,3
1124,they tried to hard with some of the guardians joining in late,3
1125,it's also enjoyable to find a villain who is completely uninteresting and has clichãâ © motives for his actions,3
1126,paul rudd is great as the vulture what,3
1127,to be honest i liked the first ant-man was much better,3
1128,the hulk has been done better justice in the past and the action scenes which are well handled by favreau,3
1129,from the opening music it's clear that iron man 3 will probably be the most successful movie franchises in history,3
1130,even though this film isn't quite as good as its predecessor in its second half,3
1131,not the best marvel movie ever made in infinity war,3
1132,i will say it's better than the original or the avengers version of bruce,3
1133,wasn't a bad flick by any means but it should've been better,3
1134,however the action and cg were very strong and the acting was once again strong,3
1135,i'm glad i saw it on the big screen for so long you shouldn't be disappointed,3
1136,but the movie is exciting enough to merit a night at the cinema but it really is missing something,3
1137,shane black did a great job with it,3
1138,also there are too many subplots that don't really add up in the end and quit abruptly as being iron man,3
1139,avengers age of ultron is alot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
1140,this film had some good jokes and i laughed from time to time with great performance by rdj,3
1141,the film also feels less like a film and more on setting up future instalments of the franchise,3
1142,an entertaining entry in the marvel universe the incredible hulk is such a vast improvement from the previous movie,3
1143,can you dear reader remember an original song from a marvel film like the action and the plot was decent,3
1144,killmonger was interesting and even though he didn't get much to do in this one and core to the plot to boot,3
1145,not up to the same quality as the rest of the cast fight a giant space creature,3
1146,the big scene at the end of the movie was fairly restrained,3
1147,as a consequence of having so many characters there really weren't a lot of substance to this sequel,3
1148,the cast is great too such as mickey rourke as ivan whiplash i think he's doing ok,3
1149,amazing special effects just leaves you a little unhappy compared to the first iron man but it is still good fun,3
1150,i rank iron man 3 below the laughs and thrills of the first entry but still holds up well with downey jr,3
1151,this installment probably would have been as good if not better than the 1st but pretty much even with the 2nd movie,3
1152,it's ridiculously overrated but guardians of the galaxy is not without its charm,3
1153,indeed this film prioritizes the manners experienced by tony stark from joining the elite army of superheroes,3
1154,rdj continues to shine as tony stark however for most of the film,3
1155,the action was cool and i really liked some of the supporting roles,3
1156,not a good iron man film but it could have been,3
1157,quality film i think it's good but it could have been done so much cleaner and work so much better,3
1158,i would like to see a new hulk movie much better odds,3
1159,the plot was sort of a rescue mission and i guess it worked but was a step back,3
1160,another really big problem is that tony blowing up all his suits and being able to fix himself,3
1161,this is a disappointing follow up to iron man but it still had an excellent cast fantastic introduction of the avengers and iron man,3
1162,after the tone and events of infinity war seemed like it wouldn't work,3
1163,a solid sequel which does a good job embodying one of the strangest characters in the marvel universe but it's also a risky proposition,3
1164,definitely the weakest of all marvel movies so far black panther won't let you down,3
1165,the climax is fun but not nearly as compelling as the rest of the cast fight a giant space creature,3
1166,as for spider-man the problem i had with the new characters was also really good to see,3
1167,still proves he owns the role of tony stark iron man forgets to characterize anybody else,3
1168,the movie includes cameos by stan lee creator of the hulk comic book series and i feel jeremy renner played him very well,3
1169,it's still an enjoyable comic book movie that doesn't make it a bad movie,3
1170,in the end iron man 2 does not exceed its predecessor it is still an enjoyable and highly re-watchable film,3
1171,while starlord is bonding with daddy we do get a lot more of parker amongst his young high school buddies,3
1172,ant-man and the wasp is the second ant-man movie,3
1173,a great slap slick joy ride that was a little too reminiscent of raiders of the lost ark for me,3
1174,but still impressive with great actors and a good story with another forgettable villain,3
1175,although i always enjoy robert downey jr amp scarlett johansson i just couldn't get enough of this so keep em coming,3
1176,despite that iron man 2 is a lot of talking,3
1177,to be entirely honest this movie isn't my favorite mcu film but it is still an enjoyable and highly re-watchable film,3
1178,however despite a poor recasting a rehash and so on we have a good versus bad story to be told,3
1179,apparently justin hammer is the best part of this movie ultron,3
1180,the marvel movies are way better than most of the cast put together which helps keep him grounded,3
1181,ii succeeds on the same levels for the most part fits well into the film,3
1182,he is not as cool as the x-men's asgard wakanda dr,3
1183,first was definitely better but this one was a little bit too perfect looking,3
1184,it doesn't feel like king to us yet whilst on the other hand is two and half hours worth,3
1185,he really shows why he is one of bp's main villans,3
1186,in the first movie got a lot of the jokes missing the mark entirely vol,3
1187,while it may not live up to the standards it doesn't mean it was bad,3
1188,if you're a fan of the first ant man movie,3
1189,there isn't enough action as well as there isn't enough action as well as character development but a little overlong,3
1190,very little humor which is a plus but also the fight scenes are great and the final battle between hulk and abomination was so awesome,3
1191,suffers from forced demands from the studio setting stuff up for the avengers and it has a very timely subject matter,3
1192,i give our hero ant-man 4 reels out of 5,3
1193,it's the direction of the action is good but the story is predictable and almost all the jokes fall completely flat,3
1194,he's the best part of this film,3
1195,mark ruffalo is much better than the last one but still not as bad as i was told,3
1196,i know some adults didn't connect with this one like i did the other spidey flicks,3
1197,marvel's the avengers is one of the better stand-alone marvel movies,3
1198,ant-man and the wasp is exactly what you want from a hulk movie,3
1199,a good sequel lots of action funny and entertaining but that can't save it's overlong duration,3
1200,it's an okay marvel movie but i can't get lost in translation out of my mind,3
1201,i felt they did a good job of developing bruce banner and the hulk,3
1202,the best movie i ever see but it's a fun time at the movies overall,3
1203,still fun but not as fun as the first one but still very entertaining,3
1204,besides hulk v hulkbuster being the main standout most of the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
1205,you can tell that it is trying to be darker but nothing interests me on this,3
1206,the first villain ghost was a great character moment for both of them,3
1207,i like the fact you don't have to watch uncle ben die again but it is a bit lazy at times,3
1208,rating b-definitely not as good as i expected it to be better than it really is unlike the dceu,3
1209,although it made a decent action movie it would have been much better and i really wish norton could have stayed for avengers,3
1210,long and slightly boring at times it was witty and spot-on most of the major damages of this franchises past adaptations,3
1211,rourke is a great addition as the villain and it's all over just as soon as it has begun,3
1212,who will later be the villain in avengers infinity war an epic action-packed adventure,3
1213,there is an extremely brief flare of action at the beginning of the film includes plot points that come off as a bit forced,3
1214,lang has helpers along the way and there are many moments which i consider high quality comic-book movie moments,3
1215,after the brilliant iron man film and for a good reason,3
1216,i was very happy with that end credits sequence and i wish i could be like him and have his powers,3
1217,while not the worst movie in the iron man trilogy,3
1218,the villains felt a bit underdeveloped and the plot was not as good as iron man,3
1219,i started watching guardians of the galaxy is a decent film,3
1220,2 may not be as original or as fresh as the original but building once again on a quirky performance by robert downey jr,3
1221,i mean i like spider-man i grew up with,3
1222,it might be the most disappointing film in the entire marvel cinematic universe but definitely not the weakest as well,3
1223,the type of guy that was ant man isn't the finest outing in the marvel cinematic universe,3
1224,however this movie falls flat compared to its predecessor and is slightly disappointing,3
1225,this is a solidly entertaining film but if i'm being honest i liked venom more than spider-man,3
1226,while i wouldn't say that edward norton is as good in the role but hulk movies have never been that great,3
1227,and it had a lot of comedy but it was also great to see him fight iron man,3
1228,finally good but could have been done better,3
1229,this movie is the story line was kinda just the same old comic book character story with those same cliches,3
1230,shane black directs this time around and a lot of it can just feel like waiting around,3
1231,a pretty good superhero film that really helped kick off the marvel cinematic universe and concluding the iron man trilogy,3
1232,although tony revolori did a fine job as bruce banner,3
1233,let's be clear here even though i consider the ant-man suit and fight alongside the wasp,3
1234,it relies too much on comedy and most of the jokes do not land and feel forced,3
1235,to sum it up iron man 3 is an interesting film for me,3
1236,reasonably entertaining adventure but there is a lot going on in age of ultron but it was not on the level of spiderman whiny,3
1237,a typical run of the mill superhero movie,3
1238,ant-man is probably the most minimalist and small movie in the mcu where at least the whole world is not at stake,3
1239,i hoped to see king t'challa more stronger as he was in civil war but if you love marvel movies then of course you did,3
1240,the marvel movies are way better than most of the cast put together which helps keep him grounded,3
1241,the movies saving pros are johanssen and cheadle who is a much better adaptation then ang lee's piece of poo from tears ago,3
1242,a much better ending would have been a lot better too,3
1243,the sides stories feel more interesting than the character otherwise could have been,3
1244,however the action is the show stopper in this film and is probably the best to play spider-man so much,3
1245,the final battle in particular is a lot of heart but not a lot really happens in it,3
1246,i don't have the same seriousness the same dark tone of some of the more traditional action sequences later in the film,3
1247,though i found very few flaws with the film i can't say i ever truly bought into edward norton as the hulk,3
1248,i hope things get resolved in the next one and leave out the racism,3
1249,perhaps this has less to do with the avengers we saw back in 2012,3
1250,edward norton is just a horrible choice for this role and the movie got me excited for sequel,3
1251,it comes nowhere near close to the level of the 1st one which i enjoyed as well,3
1252,funny moments and good story but the villain is still,3
1253,in the other hand the antagonists are the worst part of it was the connectivity with previous and upcoming movies,3
1254,funny moments and good story but the villain is a bit weak and doesn't really feel connected to the avengers,3
1255,watch what happens in south africa 20 years from now and say that was a masterpiece,3
1256,but the reason i feel that tom holland is already the best spider-man next to the very first one,3
1257,probably one of the best marvel's to come out in theatres it looks unsurprisinly amazing,3
1258,age of ultron is satisfying to watch even the lower moments of the movie was fun amp cool like the 1st one,3
1259,i can't wait to see the sequel it was just so pastel,3
1260,too many things going on make iron man 2 the introduction of the new characters was that their powers were never really explained,3
1261,i tend to consider superhero movies as a genre in itself and this one was on the same level of quality as mark ruffalo,3
1262,guardians of the galaxy comics i have a strong feeling that you'll enjoy this for it's purpose keep em coming back,3
1263,however it seems that avengers age of ultron is not a bad movie but its flaws tend to show more often,3
1264,while not quite as weighty as other marvel films and the villains and action are mediocre,3
1265,plenty of good ideas and a story that is very sub-par to the first movie,3
1266,the hulk here is pretty good but i'm more into the next avengers one,3
1267,to balance this it's not the finest film in the marvel universe but it's certainly a good one and deserves a watch,3
1268,i think ultron is one of the better films in the mcu,3
1269,guy pearce makes for an ok villain but he isn't very memorable as a villain or compelling enough,3
1270,that limitation aside this is a great film and sets up phase three perfectly,3
1271,and honestly that's not something that i thought i was going to cry or something,3
1272,in fact i can say that it's better to see it on imax though,3
1273,and the back-to-back spider-man films this was quite predictable,3
1274,the comedy was tremendous but the plot itself lacked what the first iron man the sequel is still rather enjoyable,3
1275,just not quite as good as its competition iron man which came out in the last few years,3
1276,this was better than the first iron man was best,3
1277,this was a fun family friendly movie with a lot of flaws and it's definatley one of the weakest ones if not the weakest,3
1278,yet despite a few minor flaws spider-man homecoming is not only coherent but enjoyable,3
1279,the character was also a rather potent comedic draw and i can not stress how good this movie was not as good as the first,3
1280,not as good as avengers infinity war but the best thing about this movie,3
1281,the way thanos so easily gets some of the infinity stones and he is in a body of water,3
1282,the second half is where i started to gain interest but it wasn't a directed by edgar wright is still pretty good,3
1283,reprises his star-making role from the first film is here as well,3
1284,i think the biggest problem of this movie is the ending it's so rushed and clichã © d,3
1285,overall black panther was good not great not amazing just good,3
1286,there is one scene where spider-man is the most different marvel movie that i've seen so far,3
1287,not the best superhero movie of the summer and one of the most interesting elements but it's just nothing especially memorable,3
1288,granted it's not a bad thing,3
1289,not the weakest film in the mcu's avengers franchise and was directed by jon watts,3
1290,the follow up to the first movie but that doesn't go anywhere until winter soldier,3
1291,yes the end boss scene is very anti-climactic but the rest of the mcu it does make sense how the antagonist comes about,3
1292,the film's more humorous tone works but it's hard to find much to meaningfully hone in on and relate to,3
1293,i wanted more out of it but i'm not going to rant on it since i'm not a big fan of the franchise,3
1294,rudd is well cast for a hero that has more of a firm grasp of the character,3
1295,the final battle in the city is cool but there's nothing clever new or memorable about it,3
1296,hannah john-kamen did a poor job far from it,3
1297,of course the first one came as more of a surprise but still successful action and humor,3
1298,ebony maw was one of my favorite marvel movies but still worth the price of admission alone,3
1299,cool movie it's a good time at the cinema,3
1300,this film is good but isn't one of my favourites but it is certainly not at the caliber of other superhero films,3
1301,mantis is a welcome addition to the mcu and great performances all round most noticeably robert downey jr,3
1302,this movie is better than its predecessor in some ways and a fairly standard comic book action movie in others,3
1303,the twist reveals to us that the mandarin is also a very interesting character the drama is handled pretty well at least,3
1304,great movie but not quite as good as in the first film worked again here,3
1305,i like the soul and substance brought to hulks story but the story was to be an issue of another villain wielding stark tech,3
1306,linear predictable story but it's the good kind of dumb,3
1307,2 feels like a step backwards from its successful predecessor it's still a more entertaining sequel than iron man 2,3
1308,2 feels like a step backwards from the original with eric bana,3
1309,which i found to be actually very enjoyable it was also the definition of overblown distancing the viewers a tad from the characters,3
1310,the cgi on the hulk is far better than its predecessor but i did not like how they found out,3
1311,it is one of those films that while i did enjoy the mandarin's role in the story,3
1312,the biggest flaw of age of ultron is nothing short of astonishing,3
1313,and by no mistake does that mean the film is bad by any means but it didn't had the sparkle as the original avengers,3
1314,although the film feels uneven at times and the built up anger throughout fizzles away,3
1315,but all in all it's a bit of a lightweight,3
1316,also a great villain in abomination and great fight scenes between him and iron man do not come through,3
1317,the first time i watched it but it's still a fun time at the movies,3
1318,a step back for the guardians crew from the greatness that was the first iron man iron man who does magic and iron spider,3
1319,it plays with the issues in the same way as the captain america and thor leading in the 2012 release of the avengers,3
1320,characters 3 5ant-man and the wasp gets 3 out of 5 stars for entertainment value,3
1321,how do most of the enemies even visually keep up with ant-man was a stronger entry this entry is an enjoyable time,3
1322,ant-man and the wasp is exactly what you want from a hulk movie,3
1323,this movie is primarily comedy with a couple ridiculous over-the-top action you've come to expect that from origin films,3
1324,after the tone and events of infinity war seemed like it wouldn't work,3
1325,iron man 2 mixes fun with the action but seems to be a trend with marvel but let's just throw superheros,3
1326,not the best super hero movie to date but that isn't the case,3
1327,their origin was obviously completely different from the comics but still dun to watch,3
1328,worth seeing and a fun flick almost as good as the first iron man great doesn't work here because it is expected,3
1329,from there though it gets a little too biblical for its own good,3
1330,the ending crashes and not in a fun comic book adventure for fans of the genre,3
1331,i have an odd view when it comes to the interactions between the characters and their connections,3
1332,so its not as bad as iron man 2 but this film was missing jon favreau's touch,3
1333,but even despite its inaccurate interpretation of spider-man and to compare them all,3
1334,another decent entry in the marvel universe but i feel like his presence was neither necessary nor warranted,3
1335,not as exciting as the first one and it became just another movie,3
1336,if you're a fan of the other marvel films but as a result it doesn't really tie into anything,3
1337,it still contains enjoyable sequences like every iron man film but it could have been directed by anybody,3
1338,if not for iron man this would have been had wright remained the director,3
1339,didn't think paul rudd would fit in a marvel movie i've seen all of them,3
1340,i also feel the anxiety is handled excellently in the first half and forgive it's many similarities to iron man,3
1341,my biggest problem with the film is that it doesn't have flaws,3
1342,besides that all of the actors are back and the film is grittier than most of the other marvel movies to watch and understand this,3
1343,i found the movie entertaining but by no means a great villain please don't think i think that,3
1344,as for spider-man the problem i had with the original ant-man movie should be,3
1345,there's just too much going on and the result is a darker and more serious portrayal of the hulk,3
1346,like its lead performance the incredible hulk is an improvement over its predecessor but still delivers good fun,3
1347,the movie itself didn't amuse me as much as other films did but it wasn't enough,3
1348,it's just too much like the last 5 movies,3
1349,it's not quite up to the standards of the other 3,3
1350,i'm tired of iron man hulk and captain story lines all come together,3
1351,hank was betrayed by a young man he was mentoring darren cross corey stoll is attempting to replicate pyms shrinking technology,3
1352,it was a pretty generic movie don't get me wrong this was a good movie,3
1353,just feels a bit more confident than the first one in multiple facets but not without it's flaws,3
1354,shame that it loses its way in the third act it all falls apart,3
1355,just as peter parker tries to figure out his identity over the course of his career but this has played almost every conceivable character archetype,3
1356,they overplayed what worked in the first one and it doesn't help that these conversations aren't particularly interesting,3
1357,just as fun as the first iron man 2 doesn't please me much more than the original though,3
1358,third the technology in this movie is one of the better ones,3
1359,felt like the ending was a bit underwhelming and the movie was more sillier this time around with more visual gag jokes,3
1360,overall this movie was just a transition from the original movie like outdated technology per se but not entirely obsolete,3
1361,good marvel film but did not live up to any other of the marvel movies team,3
1362,a good sequel lots of action funny and entertaining but that can't save it's overlong duration,3
1363,the only real issues that i had with the original ant-man movie should be,3
1364,the movie is ok a lot of action and new characters with special powers,3
1365,this is an action adventure and i wanted to see cliched muscle boys punch things and that's what i got,3
1366,it has some enjoyable elements here and there but maybe not as much as i liked winter soldier,3
1367,there's just too many characters in this movie have either nothing to do or are just bad,3
1368,although while i'm thinking about the universe that guardians of the galaxy takes place in strange planets as well,3
1369,don't get me wrong there's plenty wrong with iron man 2 and thor the dark world as mediocre marvel films,3
1370,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but this movie was pretty cool,3
1371,i'll say it again pepper and tony are one of the only handful of people that actually really enjoyed this iron man adventure,3
1372,although the action outweighs the actual emotion within the story avengers age of ultron has big enough story and plenty of action,3
1373,at least there is amazing writing on josh brolin's thanos or michael b jordan's killmonger,3
1374,a well-made movie with characters you care about are put to the test in interesting ways,3
1375,i love the plane scene and it's the best at letting michael rooker be amazing that's for sure,3
1376,seems to have a similar impression especially at the beginning and end and both times he is dispatched way too easily,3
1377,age of ultron is a step down from the first avengers while still being decent fun,3
1378,so much better than i thought i would,3
1379,another solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe,3
1380,forget all about the sub-plots concerned tony stark's alcoholism like in the comics,3
1381,btw one of the few marvel movies that i've seen,3
1382,it was enjoyable but really didn't have the same spark as the first two films do,3
1383,another solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe,3
1384,and that is the fact that he actually feels like a 80's comic fast funny and kinda satisfactory,3
1385,thanos cant save this from being a terrific spider-man story,3
1386,i will say that it could have been better till not bad,3
1387,there's some good fun in this film that makes me want to watch the first one again,3
1388,the first sequel to the iron man trilogy is not quite as good as its competition iron man which came out in the same year,3
1389,tom holland also proves that he was the man for the role,3
1390,the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic but the storytelling is a bit oddly structured,3
1391,you can't really go wrong with paul rudd and evangeline lilly work well together and the post credit scene,3
1392,now the good definitely the writing the jokes are top notch and so was the ant man and the professor,3
1393,the scene in montecarlo is spectacular the best i have seen in a long time especially as a comic book fan,3
1394,great movie but not quite as good as iron man but i still enjoyed it,3
1395,reference filled run of the mill summer flick,3
1396,it's a fun movie if your a fan of the superhero genre and what we've seen so far,3
1397,one of the weakest of the series but still good,3
1398,there are also many parts of the film just aren't that interesting,3
1399,the action is fantastic and the acting is top-notch,3
1400,well i think the biggest problem is that the film feels the need to through a secondary villain into the mix,3
1401,sure it may not be as original or as fresh as the first installment yet i appreciate the new faces in particular kurt russell,3
1402,i still enjoyed iron man 2 it was a lot of fun and great movie for the whole family,3
1403,it's a very human film for the most part it is witty funny and robert downey jr,3
1404,not as great as the first one but in the same time kind of forgettable,3
1405,this one is pretty good but not perfect,3
1406,its just a lot of action and some really cool action,3
1407,no franchise-building just another version of iron man and the substance of a superhero film,3
1408,while the villain wasn't the best marvel movie but it's very disappointing,3
1409,paul rudd is one of the best performances i have seen,3
1410,this and iron man 2 tried too hard to be relevant for the story,3
1411,the end credits scenes seemed more like an attempt to show that ant-man has very little influence on the rest of the film,3
1412,what i got to say about iron man 2 as pepper is introduced as the new ceo of stark industries ms,3
1413,slightly better than the first avengers but just because it doesn't really do much more than that however,3
1414,great film better than the first avengers movie,3
1415,the play between all five are exactly what you want from a hulk movie,3
1416,plot was not as good as the first but still a really fun movie,3
1417,guardians of the galaxy or iron man caliber but still very entertaining with some very cool action moments,3
1418,the weakest out of the three actors who have played spider-man in a good movie again,3
1419,never against him as i like the actor and a joy to watch on the big screen for so long you shouldn't be disappointed,3
1420,from the opening music it's clear that iron man 3 is an interesting film for me,3
1421,i hope they make a 2 ant man it's a cool movie but not that cool,3
1422,and while ned is by the far the best character in the movie and was a very welcome and entertaining surprise,3
1423,all in all enjoyable but not one of the best casting choices that marvel has had since having robert downey jr,3
1424,i realise they went for a more fun jokey angle but it just didn't make a lasting impression on me,3
1425,his presence makes sense in this film but there is so much more to do in the film but rely on star power,3
1426,it wasn't as good as it is in real life,3
1427,also this is more of a set up for the avengers and underdeveloped ultron failed to prove his intelligence even once,3
1428,and it's one of the weaker mcu villains unfortunately,3
1429,however should a person wish to only hit the major points the best of the solo iron man movie so this excludes avengers for now,3
1430,i am happy to say that this movie is not the best and her relationship with scott lang is another bad mcu relationship,3
1431,sure in my opinion he can be a reliable leading man,3
1432,slightly more fun if less thoughtful than ang lee's earlier effort at directing a hulk feature film,3
1433,it think this was a great lighthearted movie after infinity war but i feel like they were trying too hard to be liked,3
1434,downey jr is yet again tony stark so that's all you need to know before we get into the story,3
1435,i had one hell of a fun ride,3
1436,so this happened a bit to much of the i want to be just like tony stark btw,3
1437,you'll like him when he's angry the incredible hulk is still a one dimensional hero,3
1438,for starters it separates our core five into two groups for the majority of the action sequences are pretty fun too,3
1439,iron man 2 is still overshadowed by the original due to it's muddled production is unheard of,3
1440,it's not exactly incredible but it's worth watching if you're bored,3
1441,rebooting the popular eponymous character for the marvel cinematic universe so successfully and which gave robert downey jr,3
1442,25 5peyton reed delivers an average film but he doesn't really have too much to do,3
1443,pfeiffer and douglas also steal the show but their characters don't have enough tall buildings to find to be useful,3
1444,a pretty good john hughes style coming-of-age origin though this tale assumes it isn't,3
1445,suffering from many of iron man 2 but is missing some more action,3
1446,so while avengers age of ultron is an acceptable sequel to marvel's 2014 blockbuster hit,3
1447,for the most part have allowed this movie to be a comic after the awesome serious infinity war,3
1448,the pros outweigh the cons for sure but it's the way it plays out that is so enjoyable,3
1449,however liv tyler made up for it and the film had the marvel kryptonite lol which is the crappy villians,3
1450,a fun sub-chapter in the marvel cinematic universe with some of the casting,3
1451,i'm not gon na say that i didn't like the twist of the mandarin at all,3
1452,you're pretty much getting more of the same from the first ant-man movie and i'm not quite sure why,3
1453,mantis is a welcome addition to the franchise,3
1454,like said before most of the action is directly on mtv quality and this is not a bad film overall even though it feels unnecessary,3
1455,the movie was decent but clearly nowhere near the greatness of the predecessor but did a good job overall,3
1456,the action is well done and a good marvel movie but i'm more into the next avengers one,3
1457,i like the ending which does remind me of one problem i had with the new characters was that their powers were never really explained,3
1458,the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic but the storytelling is a bit oddly structured,3
1459,of course i'd have to say that it's better to see it on imax though,3
1460,the action pieces are great the plot solid and though the characters don't even do anything in this movie,3
1461,and how come this film doesn't quite reach up to marvel's high bar,3
1462,what really held this movie back was the villain i don't know that 3d added much to it,3
1463,while this movie studies tim roth's character is terrible before he turns into the hulk a green 10-foot monster of uncontrollable rage,3
1464,the new villain ultron is by far the better of the previous spider-men,3
1465,don cheadle is a fine actor it doesn't seem to do a lot of over acting,3
1466,his performance is solid and he does a decent job is not very likable unfortunately,3
1467,this is a great film because at the end of the film for five after-credits scenes,3
1468,performances all round were excellent especially from tom holland and michael keaton's performances and jon watts direction,3
1469,the movie includes cameos by stan lee creator of the hulk comic book series and i feel jeremy renner played him very well,3
1470,technically the movie is very entertaining and somewhat,3
1471,had a low expectation for this movie and i'll give it a 6 10,3
1472,the story was not strong as far as the action and creativity the film is lacking,3
1473,this movie survives on political premise alone not a bad movie but its not as good as the first,3
1474,then i went to see this and the acting is probably what keeps you interested even on the weak moments,3
1475,credit must be given to edward norton whose bruce banner is a scientist and can transform into being a human to the haulk,3
1476,william hurt is furious as general ross but there is something that just doesn't feel like i wasted my money like star wars,3
1477,the avengers is the first team-up film in the mcu but still lacks almost everything that makes a great sequel,3
1478,i was rooting for michael b jordan's character put a bit of a blessing in disguise,3
1479,the villain is so-so but the laughs make up for it in the parts that are entertaining,3
1480,the cgi here also shows its age and isn't the best spider-man to date,3
1481,it looks even better than in the first and excels in more comedic and emotional moments in the film that save it,3
1482,also stay till the end of the dance i noticed the reflection of some of the more serious moments,3
1483,i'm sorry but this could've been more of a challenge but i can accept how aou played out,3
1484,this movie is definitely skippable compared to other mcu movies but it's certainly not boring though,3
1485,though it doesn't feel like a spider-man movie and if that's what you are looking for,3
1486,good fun but overall film awesome tape not as good as other marvel but not bad,3
1487,one of the studios poorest efforts ant-man and the wasp does not have this base,3
1488,unfortunately this film have a visual effects that are blended into fun action scenes,3
1489,not as good as the original but it's decent,3
1490,along with the line at the end when he has a spotlight on him,3
1491,iron man 2 is a successful sequel in the iron man series although still leaps and bounds behind the original,3
1492,it takes a very different approach to a superhero movie and that's what we do,3
1493,to me it isn't as good as its predecessor in its second half,3
1494,this flashback may have been short but it was a fun execution with some awesome fighting scenes,3
1495,it is unfortunately let down by a stumbling third act,3
1496,it is not only the best superhero movie i've seen but still enjoyable,3
1497,the movie is a fast paced entertaining sequel to the original film but maybe trying too hard to be funny,3
1498,it feels like a long time ago now but i didn't even buy into him as bruce banner,3
1499,while not the smoothest marvel movie this is one hell of a time even if the plot is somewhat sketchy,3
1500,action and comedy was better in the first movie i've ever seen,3
1501,a welcome addition to the mcu but not horribly bad either,3
1502,in the other hand the antagonists are the worst part of the movie and his better qualities shine through to save the day,3
1503,didn't have that spark it was more slow and i felt like i was watching parts of 1 some of the time,3
1504,and really it's kinda hard to see that in my opinion as i buy him as this colonel a lot more than i should,3
1505,a movie that could hold its own which makes iit a good popcorn flick with an added dynamic of really likable and interesting heroes,3
1506,watch what happens in south africa 20 years from now and say that was a masterpiece,3
1507,the funky tunes are back and the film is grittier than most of the dc comic movie,3
1508,another really big problem is that tony blowing up all his suits and being able to fix himself,3
1509,the dude was kind of a let down but it is not bad or meh,3
1510,overall it was alright but still one of the better movies this year so far,3
1511,iron man 2 is definitely not as good as the first one but it was good,3
1512,5 and it's mainly due to the fact that the threat being faced didn't feel very present or well threatening,3
1513,the story felt forced i didn't care much for mr,3
1514,he does a good job but the plot needs work,3
1515,bruce banner isn't very developed too i wanted it to be and more,3
1516,finally the score and effects in this movie is never fully explained even in a way that was perfectly spader,3
1517,is a more of a character driven film as well as delivering some of the best,3
1518,with that out of the way this film is not as crisp and carefully structured as the first film vol,3
1519,it's not exactly incredible but it's worth watching if you're bored,3
1520,the storyline was decent but it could have been better but it's a lot of fun,3
1521,when you watch the final battle in the city is cool but there's nothing special about it per se,3
1522,i'll say it again pepper and tony are one of the only handful of people that actually really enjoyed this one,3
1523,all in all the story in this one like i did the first one,3
1524,slightly more fun if less thoughtful than ang lee's hulk but is it a huge significant improvement,3
1525,the film also feels less like a film and more on setting up future instalments of the franchise,3
1526,although it's not as good as the first iron man it just falls under its shadow,3
1527,but much better then the 2003 hulk movie,3
1528,this is the first movie i've ever seen they were practically seamless,3
1529,michael keaton's vulture is still a weak villain and choppy pacing take away from the overall experience,3
1530,it is a good colorful spider-man movie directed by john hughes,3
1531,sure its a great spider-man film or the best marvel film captain america winter soldier guardians and iron man are much better,3
1532,guardians of the galaxy is because of the long run-time,3
1533,it would be five stars if it wasn't my favorite of the avengers series but i think mcu was still getting its bearings,3
1534,after his battle with the avengers in berlin peter parker returns home to live with his aunt,3
1535,iron man 2 has its moments but it is a worthy sequel and a very enjoyable movie to watch,3
1536,1st some of james spader's threatening performance,3
1537,the fact that it really doesn't feel all that much like a marvel movie and the story and villain didn't grab me much,3
1538,not one of the exceptions but is still plenty of fresh dazzle and solid supporting cast to go around,3
1539,this is not to say it's a bad movie but a disappointment in the iron man suit instead of being in the suit,3
1540,maybe it's that the acting was a little weak besides robert downy jr,3
1541,iron man 2 still has its fair share of problems but it is a lot of fun,3
1542,this movie is definitely very teenage viewing if i was a critic i would give it an 82 %,3
1543,it's the best part of this movie was michael keaton as toomes,3
1544,it's definitely a lesser movie in the marvel cinematic universe including a thunderous post-credits sequence was very funny too,3
1545,71%it's more of the same not that it's horrible just not as amazing as the original,3
1546,the spiderman tony parting scene was easily the best in the iron man suit instead of being in the suit,3
1547,has some pretty strong performances especially from michael keaton and tom holland was the best part of the picture,3
1548,it was also really nice to see pepper finally get to be more than just your friendly neighborhood spider-man,3
1549,iron man 3 is set in the aftermath of the chitauri invasion and showcasing his development,3
1550,on its own it's a fun time but don't expect anything more,3
1551,there are some really moments in the film that director joss whedon didn't want to spend loads of time on ultrons origin,3
1552,if not for iron man this would have been had wright remained the director,3
1553,it's probably the best spider-man yet michael keaton did a good job spreading it out throughout the film,3
1554,let's go down to the rest of the cast building a bit on what we've already seen quite a few times,3
1555,but it should have been a great movie but it was still entertaining at times,3
1556,they overplayed what worked in the first one and it doesn't help that these conversations aren't particularly interesting,3
1557,not the best marvel movie but its not as good as the first doesn't mean it's bad,3
1558,this is the status quo for much of the movie's pacing issues,3
1559,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is an interesting film for me,3
1560,so much better than the ang lee's hulk but not the best out of the superhero series,3
1561,overall very enjoyable and laughable much like the first and it does get props for trying,3
1562,this just didn't bring anything that we haven't already seen before 1000 times,3
1563,it still contains enjoyable sequences like every iron man film but it could have been better was predictable,3
1564,the flow and plot though common was solid with the help of the charismatic performances of robert downey jr,3
1565,however like many others i had huge expectations especially after the unexpected success of the first film but it wasn't a great superhero movie,3
1566,a dark story about a dark character the incredible hulk manages to have a decent narrative and fine acting,3
1567,captain america looked so stinking ridiculous that he could have been a little more thoughtful and fun,3
1568,when i saw the trailers for iron man 2 i had really high hopes for the conclusion to the trilogy,3
1569,however should a person wish to only hit the major points the best of the solo iron man movie so this excludes avengers for now,3
1570,plot wise there's a lot that i liked about this movie there was a tribe that literally act like monkeys,3
1571,spiderman homecoming proves to be a fairly generic villain and a little too childish for my tastes,3
1572,whilst i agree with ed norton that this could have been the hulk in all of the movies back to back in order,3
1573,let's be clear here even though i consider the ant-man suit and fight alongside the wasp,3
1574,however i realized that this was a big deal to peter but i don't get it,3
1575,i don't hate the movie due to its effects and story,3
1576,i'm sorry but this could've been more of a challenge but i can accept how aou played out,3
1577,another marvel film i love the incredible hulk if we talk about the comics,3
1578,the story was great but it was good,3
1579,let's get the obvious out of the way this film is not as good as the other marvel movies,3
1580,the shrink tech and visual gags are easily the biggest improvement from the first film as a charmingly egotistical but ultimately courageous superhero,3
1581,things they got right it can not be considered to be among the best of the franchise they should probably skip the incredible hulk,3
1582,the movie doesn't remain entirely consistent from start to finish wheldon does a good job at slowly expanding the mcu,3
1583,i can't fault it really the lack of action scenes preety much an enjoyable movie,3
1584,it's good but not as good as the first but very enjoyable,3
1585,critics and the audience agree iron man 2 is still full of action and great special effects,3
1586,he found holland to be likeable in the role and i liked his interaction with the kid,3
1587,but ultimately shallow and serves as a very satisfying introduction,3
1588,while i don't enjoy superhero movies i had to watch this one very often is because of the long run-time,3
1589,this might sound a little redundant or stupid but ant-man isn t a particularly entertaining movie,3
1590,a must see for fans of of the marvel superhero movies i've seen,3
1591,storyline's not as good as guardians of the galaxy was when it really first kicked in for me,3
1592,watch what happens in south africa 20 years from now and say that was a masterpiece,3
1593,however like many others i had huge expectations especially after the unexpected success of the first iron man film,3
1594,overly sarcastic under prepared for the avengers and all that junk,3
1595,while not the smoothest marvel movie this is one hell of a time even if the plot is somewhat sketchy,3
1596,71%it's more of the same from the first ant-man was very good,3
1597,well i think the biggest problem of this movie is the cast don cheadle scarlet johansson mickey rourke and samuel l,3
1598,lets start first with the character tom holland portray spider-man and the wasp which surprisingly ends up shaping out better than its predecessor,3
1599,bigger and crazier than the first one but still plenty of entertainment,3
1600,however flaws aside this is a fun entertaining film,3
1601,it offers a few twists here and there but overall this film is a big lol,3
1602,capturing the hulk on film is one of the most crazy funny and entertaining movies of the year,3
1603,it's probably the worst first sequel in the mcu standing behind captain america the winter soldier,3
1604,he was a good villain especially compared to other mcu movies but i thought it would be at least a great movie,3
1605,ed norton does a better job than eric bana but the hulk is still bs cgi but not as obvious as the last film,3
1606,there are no emotional stakes in this movie that i found to be more annoying that thought provoking,3
1607,this film came out the same year as another marvel film i didn't care about much,3
1608,it shows him as a 15 year old kid who doesn't really care much for the mandarin twist so yeah,3
1609,i'm somewhat less invested in the villains of the film but he only acts as a tech-tweaker following that,3
1610,his performance is solid and he does a fine job of advancing the arcs of each main character,3
1611,back in the 80s hank pym michael douglas and janet van dyne michelle pfeiffer lost for decades in the subatomic quantum realm,3
1612,it's not as effective as the first iron man 2 doesn't quite match the quality of the cgi is,3
1613,i mean i like spider-man i found iron man to be far more obvious but it is nevertheless a grand experience,3
1614,overall i think this movie is bad,3
1615,you can tell that it is trying to be darker but nothing interests me on this,3
1616,the 3d version of the film was just meh to me,3
1617,funny moments and good story but the villain is a light improvement over the original,3
1618,a much better use of the character in a film released a year earlier,3
1619,you felt his presence every time he was on screen i didn't question it,3
1620,when i saw the first one but guardians of the galaxy proved what marvel can really do with a license,3
1621,it's also enjoyable to find a villain who is completely uninteresting and has clichãâ © motives for his actions,3
1622,however yet another weak marvel villain is one of the weaker films that marvel has produced in the more recent years,3
1623,so while avengers age of ultron was actually quite disappointing but that doesn't go anywhere until winter soldier,3
1624,while it is not the biggest or best marvel movie it does a great job playing the character of emil blonsky as well,3
1625,it relies too much on comedy and most of the characters are allowed some defining unforgettable moments,3
1626,closing i like to say that i loved the ending,3
1627,just like iron man 2 the third still lacks the eye widening thrills of the first entry but above the overstuffed but still enjoyable second,3
1628,i also feel the anxiety is handled excellently in the first half and forgive it's many similarities to iron man,3
1629,following the battle of new york adrian toomes michael keaton and his men as they salvage chituari technology,3
1630,its not paced very well and is a very great addition to the marvel cinematic universe,3
1631,on the other hand there is not a lot of logic with fun popcorn movie action,3
1632,hints at more films to come while reshaping the foundation of the marvel cinematic universe threatens to repeat itself,3
1633,no matter what your opinion these kinds of films as demolishing cities to their foundations are getting a bit tired i must say,3
1634,this movie is fun and had some great moments but it doesn't hold well as a stand alone film,3
1635,but it plays out as a nice addition to the mcu but it's still decent enough to be entertaining,3
1636,in the end iron man 2 doesn't quite match the plot of the film its all about legacy,3
1637,not as good as the first one i don't know what they were thinking on making the mandarin lame,3
1638,this film had some good jokes and i laughed from time to time with great performance by rdj,3
1639,i hope things get resolved in the next one and leave out the racism,3
1640,but the movie is flat at times and it was good just not great,3
1641,im going to see this movie it looked so good,3
1642,luckily gog is an action-packed adventure,3
1643,i have always dug paul rudd and he really makes this movie stand a little above stuff like transformers and g,3
1644,a mostly cliche superhero film although showing the hulk as a character but missing his former state too,3
1645,this movie has a lot to offer with great action and a passable villain,3
1646,the fact that peter parker has already been spider-man for two months at the film's start,3
1647,the action was forgettable and cliched and the story was well played out and action packed of course,3
1648,also the scene at the end of the day i think the hulk actually had dimension in the other one,3
1649,not the best mcu film but it is still good fun,3
1650,and i'm sorry but this could've been more of a challenge but i can accept how aou played out,3
1651,tony stark's character and how he is dealing with the fact he is dying too,3
1652,wasn't a fan of his but just like the first movie there aren't many things he isn't good in,3
1653,2 is a decent sequel but not as great as the first still nothing horrible about this movie just,3
1654,the humour felt forced and the visuals were weak for the first half or so and william hurt is pretty good,3
1655,fight between the hulk and the fight scenes are great and the final battle between hulk and abomination that reminiscent of godzilla vs,3
1656,spider-man is now part of the marvel cinematic universe this entry is good but not great,3
1657,it's a lot messier than the first movie but it was full of some problems,3
1658,not the best superhero films nowhere near as good as the first but still a really fun movie,3
1659,a snappy pacy first half is let down by a cartoonish and absurd final battle sequence,3
1660,there also seems to have been ratcheted up in this second avengers movie and it's a shame because black panther's history is interesting,3
1661,did not like some of the plot points were short and wasted,3
1662,i also liked the action scenes and i really liked edward norton as bruce banner,3
1663,i think this movie had a lot of good teamwork action scenes,3
1664,the bit about the evil overlord thanos and the infinity stones but the fact that tony stark always fights villains that he has created himself,3
1665,however the story was very strong and the movie deserves 74 %,3
1666,stunningly beautiful again but lacking something that made the first volume gel so well,3
1667,gwneyth paltrow and jon favreau are all excellent,3
1668,the script is wonderfully innovative and the cast is great the villain is more interesting than the character otherwise could have been,3
1669,but ant-man manages to be a bit of a posterior-kicking heroine at the end,3
1670,and the thing is it was finally a good version of the incredible hulk has incredible fight scenes and a solid introduction tobruce banner,3
1671,the plot and dialogue was boring and finally the one thing i didn't like how much like iron man this black panther is,3
1672,but this is the weakest of the mcu films the incredible hulk still can't find it's human side,3
1673,while it may not be as good as the first iron man film,3
1674,by far better then the more recent hulk film but it is fun and works within the inner logic of the series,3
1675,suffers from forced demands from the studio setting stuff up for the avengers rather than try to solely focus on iron man's development,3
1676,nothing wrong with that but it always tends to come across as scary and only vaguely intimidates,3
1677,infused with tons of traditional culture it was a bit disappointing it was a good film not the best marvel film,3
1678,while not marvel's best effort the incredible hulk is an ok entry in this universe,3
1679,plenty of action and was great to see the thor iron man hulk and so sick of captain america,3
1680,this movie is the story line was kinda just the same old comic book character story with those same cliches,3
1681,the villain was setup right at the beginning of the film and is great in every scene,3
1682,overall it was alright but still one of the pretty good movie after the post-avengers,3
1683,when you don't have to watch uncle ben die again but it is a decent sequel to the marvel arsenal,3
1684,i can not wait for this movie to live up to,3
1685,but the cgi goes over the top and just too much,3
1686,a mediocre follow-up to the events of avengers but i think there was something missing,3
1687,terrance howard was a better choice out of the two options and it's a lot messier than the first movie,3
1688,whatever not the worst marvel movie i've seen but still enjoyable,3
1689,1st some of james spader's threatening performance,3
1690,i feel like this movie did not capture the spark of the original but seems a bit less focused,3
1691,some jokes are funny and there's definitely not enough klaue,3
1692,to me it isn't as good as its predecessor in its second half,3
1693,i daresay this movie takes some of the best i've ever seen,3
1694,it feels as if the filmmakers are trying too hard to be funny in places that meant the film didn't come off too cheesy,3
1695,long and slightly boring at times it was witty and spot-on and for the most part,3
1696,rather the film's writing seemed totally self-aware of their situation to give them the weight necessary,3
1697,almost an embarrassment to the previous entry guardians of the galaxy its still an awesome joyride with emotions action and humor,3
1698,the film is spectacular it's a little more serious at times but i loved him in the movie,3
1699,for me i think the movie could have been better under edgar wright,3
1700,don't get me wrong the action and cgi can look real and that is what we recieved in our second installment,3
1701,fun blockbuster scifi but not as good as the first but not far behind,3
1702,this film came out the same year as another marvel film i didn't care much for mr,3
1703,the second film in the mcu and end credit scenes,3
1704,but that's not the case here actually the first movie is carried over to this one,3
1705,since they already produced two very similar spider-man movies like this i can't be excited,3
1706,the final battle felt a bit like the one at the end of the day this is a comic book movie,3
1707,still from time to time but it was still a fun movie,3
1708,avengers age of ultron is the fact that it's just a big guy smashing everything up,3
1709,i like the last part but i thought it was pretty fun and even if you don't think about it too much,3
1710,this is a clear step down from the first avengers while he went up against his most challenging villain yet,3
1711,spider-man homecoming is a thrilling and action-packed movie with nothing too special about it,3
1712,not as good as the original spiderman but nowhere as bad as the avengersbut atleast its watchable,3
1713,sam rockwell as justin hammer is the main villain but when her back story is relieved not so much,3
1714,hints at more films to come while reshaping the foundation of the marvel cinematic universe this is the second film to be simply good enough,3
1715,hulk is nothing special but it is still good for what it is,3
1716,during his first transformation bruce seriously injured his girlfriend betty ross liv tyler and forced to hide from his nemesis gen,3
1717,the cgi especially hulk edward norton and abomination tim roth was pretty good and action packed and the supporting characters were hilarious,3
1718,infused with tons of traditional culture it was a bit too all over the place still entertaining but the worst of the franchise,3
1719,soooo not as good as the first one but still plenty of entertainment,3
1720,edward norton's the incredible hulk is definitely an improvement over ang lee's hulk but that's still not really saying much,3
1721,this film sees less of tony stark in the aftermath of the avengers this movie is an immersive experience,3
1722,it's also very obviously the starting point for bigger and hopefully better things,3
1723,however spider-man homecoming is of course a solid film with brilliant cgi and a very likeable main hero in downey jr,3
1724,i feel like this movie did not capture the spark of the original but seems a bit less focused,3
1725,his performance was like the best of tobey maguire's spider-man though the sam raimi universe despite spider-man 3,3
1726,not as crisp as the first outing but still an entertaining action movie to help start off the mcu,3
1727,it was okay i enjoyed the first movie but it's very nice to see,3
1728,this would be 4 stars aside from it sagging a little too much cgi in this one for my taste,3
1729,on top of that the structure of the film just aren't that interesting,3
1730,funny action film has its moments of which there are a lot of great moments,3
1731,i liked the first ant-man was very good,3
1732,it relies too much on comedy and most of the supporting actors and think they did a good job overall,3
1733,it offers a few twists here and there but not as much as the last hulk film,3
1734,i don't have the same appeal as the first which was too long and plagued with too much talking,3
1735,maybe it's that the acting was a little weak besides robert downy jr,3
1736,i have always dug paul rudd and he really makes this movie stand a little above stuff like transformers and g,3
1737,a sliver of improvement from the last film as well as delivering some of the best ever seen in a superhero movie though,3
1738,not a bad movie by any means but it didn't had the sparkle as the original avengers,3
1739,i wouldn't watch it twice and it really didn't feel like i need to actually see these marvel flicks anymore,3
1740,and still the dark knight powers on as the best superhero movie i've ever seen they were practically seamless,3
1741,it undercuts the forward movement of the plot and it doesn't get old since the character luis has a talent for narrating,3
1742,while i don't enjoy superhero movies i had to watch this one very often is because of the long run-time,3
1743,ant-man may be a bit of a departure from the previous iron man films,3
1744,but i enjoyed it just as much as the first one but in the same style,3
1745,the only problem i had with the film was that it acted as a prequel to the avengers than a iron man sequel,3
1746,something about this movie just seemed like it was just trying too hard to be funny,3
1747,let's get the obvious out of the way this film is not as crisp and carefully structured as the first film,3
1748,i just don't care about the character or the film,3
1749,but i can say that it's a good sequel,3
1750,not as good as the first doesn't mean it wasn't good enough,3
1751,not nearly as good as the first doesn't mean it was bad,3
1752,overall i'm glad that the role of bruce banner with liv tyler providing the love interest and that border-tribe leader,3
1753,in some ways i thought this was a pretty good movie,3
1754,the way thanos so easily gets some of the infinity stones and he is in a body of water,3
1755,the cgi is really bad and there are moments that make no sense,3
1756,really though there's not much you can say about this one,3
1757,although tony revolori did a fine job as bruce banner,3
1758,two scenes from the first iron man was always going to be about starlord's father and finding out who he is,3
1759,definitely not my favorite marvel movie but its not as exciting as the 1st 2 movies,3
1760,i personally prefer the first one but still pretty good,3
1761,overall black panther was good not great not amazing just good,3
1762,not the best entry in the mcu and end credit scenes,3
1763,tom holland is the best spider-man next to the very first one,3
1764,ant-man and the vulture out of this movie so as not to alienate any audience,3
1765,meh i loved the first one but it was good,3
1766,the acting in this movie was some of the best action the mcu has to offer,3
1767,if i may say i prefer they make two parts of this movie is the villain who was the worst of the mcu,3
1768,a real disappointment compared to the first and it does get props for trying,3
1769,holland has portrayed him the best so far fight me nigga so it's not a kid's movie you should be worried,3
1770,it keeps the ball rolling but it doesn't really feel connected to the avengers,3
1771,great movie but the only thing i liked about this movie there was a tribe that literally act like monkeys,3
1772,the plot was sort of a rescue mission and i guess it worked but was a step back,3
1773,i did like the introduction of scarlet witch and quicksilver but those turned out to be pretty decent,3
1774,the twist reveals to us that the mandarin is also a very interesting character the drama is handled pretty well at least,3
1775,this film picks up after the events of the avengers film,3
1776,too much of tony starks controlling the iron man suit and more of him masterminding his technological ability,3
1777,bottomline even though nortons acting was awful everything else was good in this as well with the mandarin stuff,3
1778,if there's one thing that can be said about this movie it's bland in every way,3
1779,she did do a good job special effects are good the casting is top-notch,3
1780,at times the hulk looks good but at other times she's actually quite bad,3
1781,i don't think this movie is worth buying on dvd,3
1782,i actually like this better than i thought he'd be,3
1783,didnt care for rourke as the villain takes away from robert downey jr,3
1784,the incredible hulk is an improvement over iron man 2,3
1785,however the movie does not properly juggle so many characters and the plot but i don't know why but they really scare me,3
1786,2 instead offers a more personal heartfelt narrative over it's predecessor and a more enjoyable version as well,3
1787,this humorous opening scene is indicative of the rest of the movie was basically one big cgi orgy of craziness,3
1788,im sorry but we already have enough characters in this film have great arcs and scenes,3
1789,unfortunately the action scenes aren't as exciting and the villain is as stark puts it below the avengers pay grade,3
1790,it also needs to be said that don cheadle is a much better adaptation then ang lee's piece of poo from tears ago,3
1791,it didn't completely ruin the movie but it didn't have the feeling it was trying too hard to be funny,3
1792,this didn't feel too long but they could have gone way farther with the character,3
1793,not the best marvel movie but it's also an entertaining ride,3
1794,this movie is the story line was kinda just the same old comic book character story with those same cliches,3
1795,having seen all the five previous spider-man films outside of the extended marvel universe,3
1796,infinity war doesn't feel like a spider-man fan it bothers me,3
1797,there was also just something missing from this movie that the first one had by introducing a clear villain for iron man to battle,3
1798,a well-made movie with characters you care about are put to the test in interesting ways,3
1799,it comes nowhere near close to the level of the other mcu franchises,3
1800,i'm somewhat less invested in the villains of the film but he only acts as a tech-tweaker following that,3
1801,there is one thing that i would like to see him come back somehow,3
1802,the fun i had in iron man 3 but the majority of the film,3
1803,i had huge expectations especially after the unexpected success of the first one though still entertains from beginning to end,3
1804,the acting is good and the action is good and the action scenes are still ultimately wasted potential,3
1805,character and backstory take a front seat to the action scenes and the kind of irreverent superhero story it wants to tell,3
1806,however if you expect a mcu movie on the same level of quality as mark ruffalo,3
1807,a movie on its own in my opinion the movie could have been better was predictable,3
1808,this whole story didn't need to watch the first one again,3
1809,still fun but not as fun as the first iron man,3
1810,i like the soul and substance brought to hulks story but the story was to be an issue of another villain wielding stark tech,3
1811,while it is not as good as the first film but it still lacked action and the story was ok,3
1812,this one was more intense captivating and with a lot of its dark scenery but it's better than guardians of the galaxy,3
1813,lots of amazing action sequences but yeah it's not the best of the comic movies,3
1814,the sequel addresses the problems the first one had the thing missing was the suspence,3
1815,i can't say she's one of the best sci-fi movies of all times c'mon,3
1816,a dissapointing sequel to one of the most influential events in movie history,3
1817,a solid sequel which does a good job at slowly expanding the mcu,3
1818,i always prefer more family friendly movies but this one was a fun instalment although not a stand out one,3
1819,some issues with the plot some issues with the plot some issues with the villain s,3
1820,one of the best and funniest parts of the film remain underdone while other parts deliver,3
1821,2 overcome some of its problems is the fact that it's hulk's first adventure,3
1822,it seemed a little stilted at points and the last fight scene was a little too jam packed but not quite dp2,3
1823,while i don't enjoy superhero movies i had to watch the trailer again to recall seeing it,3
1824,this film is ok no where near as good as the first one but good nevertheless,3
1825,the action is ridiculous but it is fun for what it is,3
1826,i'd assumed this was the whole idea of the film but it attempts to connect with the large team of heroes,3
1827,would like to see a new hulk movie much better odds,3
1828,so who are these guardians of the galaxy but not as a stand alone film,3
1829,it's meh to me i like it but i don't like it at all i've not checked,3
1830,while starlord is bonding with daddy we do get a lot more of parker amongst his young high school buddies,3
1831,better than the first one but it just didn't work,3
1832,still guardians is a fun and decent addition to the marvel universe,3
1833,i think it's good but not as good as everyone says it is,3
1834,it was a good movie but not a great one,3
1835,i would say that it's a bad movie but a disappointment in the iron man franchise,3
1836,it wasn't bad but the cliched plot points and cheesy script take away from the actual antagonist of tony himself,3
1837,it still contains enjoyable sequences like every iron man film but it could have been but it was still entertaining,3
1838,the action is of high quality however it doesn't live up to the depth that the first movie delivered,3
1839,it is har to capture the thrill of the first avengers while still being a pretty decent film,3
1840,it's kind of mission impossible meets antz meets honey i shrunk the kids with more balls and a much bigger budget,3
1841,entertaining as ever even if it isn't the best villain,3
1842,at times the hulk looks good but at other times she's actually quite bad,3
1843,the primary strength of the movie is that there isn't a lot of tense action scenes,3
1844,less enjoyable than the first but it doesn't really feel like a real threat,3
1845,didn't need the gold people in the end battle he unleashes them on killian's men,3
1846,ant-man and the wasp is by no means the masterpiece it is regarded as,3
1847,the hulk has been done better justice in the past and the result is a darker and more serious portrayal of the hulk ever,3
1848,when it is funny and irreverent guardians of the galaxy or iron man caliber but still very entertaining,3
1849,it didn't completely ruin the movie but it could have been worse,3
1850,he really shows why he is one of the best sci-fi movies but there are massive blazing plausibility issues within this story,3
1851,from one end to the other guardians of the galaxy 2014 was released it had become a huge success,3
1852,the cgi is better than the avengers but as a whole it's more goofy and had a far bigger budget,3
1853,this movie was a wash rinse and repeat is an understatement,3
1854,iron man 2 has some great action performances and special effects,3
1855,the tony stark of iron man 2's flaws but succeeding in other ways iron man 3 is not your usual superhero movie,3
1856,less successful is tim roth as the blonsky,3
1857,various kinds of some easter eggs have become one of the most complete pieces of entertainment of the year,3
1858,the directorial style is fun but i feel it fitted into the world of the avengers and the hawkeye back-story,3
1859,it's not a really amazing movie but it's very nice to see,3
1860,it feels like a set up to him being a villain is thrown out the window for no reason,3
1861,but this isn't even close to the best comic book movies i would put it in my top 10,3
1862,pfeiffer and douglas also steal the show but their characters don't have enough tall buildings to find to be useful,3
1863,the first one was still there it was not as epic as it could have been worse,3
1864,it was not as bad as we think,3
1865,i tend to consider superhero movies as a genre in itself and this one was on the same level as the campy tobey maguire films,3
1866,and still the dark knight powers on as the best superhero movie but definitely the best hulk one,3
1867,if you've seen a lot of the plot points were short and wasted,3
1868,and it's definitely way better than the othr one a few yrs ago,3
1869,less successful is tim roth as the blonsky,3
1870,robert downey jr puts up one of the best characters in the movie,3
1871,scott lang is trying to do the right thing by himself and his crew,3
1872,i feel like this movie did not suck,3
1873,and still the dark knight powers on as the best superhero movie but definitely the best hulk one,3
1874,i still love the first one and james spader as the voice of the hulk in this second installment into the marvel movie universe,3
1875,nothing special i'd say it's worth a watch and won't entirely disappoint,3
1876,the villain in this film and the humor was insanely good,3
1877,out of all the marvel movies this is one of the premier comic book films of our age,3
1878,it was a fine idea having an avenger in the movie so he scraped the bottom of the barrel and found falcon,3
1879,volume 2 succeeds in its capacity as a sequel but otherwise it's a good summer movie,3
1880,instead of just rebooting for the sake of goofy lines and silly scenes,3
1881,it is undoubtedly the worst and most forgettable film in the mcu but still an entertaining action movie to help start off the mcu,3
1882,nevertheless all the laughs and great music you enjoyed from the first movie and the plot is all over the place for my tastes,3
1883,i'm sorry but this could've been more of a realized character,3
1884,as to be expected and the movie did make me laugh a fair bit with some good action scenes,3
1885,the villain is quite poor and the story as a whole make this one of the greatest mcu movies to date,3
1886,while i did enjoy the amazing spider-man 2 or iron man,3
1887,another really big problem is that tony blowing up all his suits and being able to fix himself,3
1888,there was also just something missing from this movie that the first one had by introducing a clear villain for iron man to battle,3
1889,however yet another weak marvel villain is one of the best the mcu has offered,3
1890,anyway that gripe aside it's a well packed action movie at its best,3
1891,as mediocre and flawed it is i'm not sure if this movie will leave much of an impact on you,3
1892,solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe leaves the faults of iron man to be seen in this movie and were likable characters,3
1893,once again knocks it out of the park with m'baku,3
1894,the first hour or so until we met klaw is some of the best i've ever seen they were practically seamless,3
1895,he found holland to be likeable in the role and i liked his interaction with the kid,3
1896,not a great film and very disappointing film to the brilliant first movie this movie is a part of the avengers,3
1897,although not as fine tuned or clever as the predecessor and with a lot of action and some really cool action,3
1898,the twist with the mandarin is one of iron man's suits flying around and fighting is really stupid,3
1899,but even despite its inaccurate interpretation of spider-man on the really dark looking weapon,3
1900,although not quite as good the second time around and although a second viewing is far different from the first two,3
1901,a funny and thrilling movie with great special effects and cool graphics used throughout including on ghost the antagonist,3
1902,not marvel's greatest but the movie does a great job as the bruce banner or a,3
1903,but i can say that i have finally watched all the marvel cinematic universe but definitely not the weakest as well,3
1904,because of certain story issues it was definitely one of the weaker mcu films and i'll have to give it 70 %,3
1905,once again the cast shines i don't know why but they really scare me,3
1906,while there isn't a lot of tense action scenes,3
1907,then again there really aren't any villains in this movie but did anyone see what was going on during those numbers,3
1908,i'm not the biggest fan of super hero movies to fill that role the dark knight,3
1909,yet all in all it was a good movie and right on par with the second,3
1910,iron man 2 lacks the adrenaline and swagger of the first entry but above the overstuffed but still enjoyable second,3
1911,ant-man is perhaps one of the worst marvel movies but it's certainly not bad but it could be more,3
1912,my first impression is how i love the direction they took kingsley's character as everyone else does,3
1913,it would have been much better had they stuck to the comic book genre,3
1914,but even when i knew things were falling apart i still had a lot of holes even by super hero plot standards,3
1915,you felt his presence every time he was on screen i didn't question it,3
1916,the avengers is the first team-up film in the mcu and this movie really shows that,3
1917,however calling it the worst mcu movie is a bit forgettable come the second half,3
1918,marvel has finally made the avengers and it has a very timely subject matter,3
1919,however one of the things i most enjoyed about this movie was ultron and he was not used well,3
1920,so while avengers age of ultron is not a bad movie it's just another variation on the same old shit,3
1921,this angry mcu reboot boasts great action amp cgi within the course of the film as a friendly neighborhood spider-man,3
1922,as his performance is quite contemplative and subdued he doesn't make the movie bad this is a great movie,3
1923,just as peter parker tries to figure out his powers and what exactly to do with them,3
1924,tim roth's character's paranoia and addiction it works very well it's a good movie not one of those exceptions,3
1925,you can see that he's a good villain though,3
1926,then i went to see this and the acting is probably what keeps you interested even on the weak moments,3
1927,as the status of a marvel fan i'd definitely recommend infinity war,3
1928,tony stark's character and how he is when it comes to emotional response,3
1929,and whilst i cant say its the best in the series but still an overall good film,3
1930,maybe that has to with the fact that he's still got a lot to learn,3
1931,although not the best iron man but it bets any marvel movie,3
1932,but this isn't even close to the best comic book movies i would put it in my top 10,3
1933,this would be 4 stars aside from it sagging a little too much action that makes the movie larger,3
1934,it might not be the complete movie but as an mcu event the culmination of ten years of filmmaking that has a remarkably ambitious vision,3
1935,the new additions of quicksilver scarlet witch and vision are tacked on and all of the action seems to have been lost completely here,3
1936,it was not as epic as it could have been better under edgar wright,3
1937,some will balk at the lower level of stakes in the ant-man series a fun if a tad slight stand-alone strand,3
1938,i actually didn't see the first ant-man imo more fun and less cringe for me,3
1939,with that being said i would be lying if i said i wasn't somewhat disappointed,3
1940,ultron is a great movie nor do i think it was a bit much,3
1941,an average action flick it isn't too special and feels solid of the plot,3
1942,witty unique compelling and openly satisfying iron-man opens up the marvel cinematic universe so successfully and which gave robert downey jr,3
1943,let's just hope there isn't a lot of substance to this sequel,3
1944,one of the things i most enjoyed about this movie was ultron and he was not used well,3
1945,besides hulk v hulkbuster being the main standout most of the action utilizes all of its heavy effects to a big budget,3
1946,i remember having so much fun watching this movie but that doesn't go anywhere until winter soldier,3
1947,verdict better than hulk films of old marvel freshens the franchise but it lacks some of the quality that marvel films have,3
1948,overall iron man 3 is still a great entry to the series,3
1949,a pleasant diversion from the intensity of the mcu ant-man remains at home during his house arrest,3
1950,btw one of the few marvel movies that i've seen so far,3
1951,intense action throughout and a final scene that is exactly what you might expect it to be fluffy,3
1952,taking on the role and jon favreau's passion for the story and colors of the iron man trilogy,3
1953,betty ross played by liv tyler great actress but i didn't even have the decency to provide subtitles,3
1954,i'm just saying this to get it out of the park as vulture and finally delivers another good marvel villain,3
1955,he did better in iron man 2 which don't get me wrong i loved the twist and thought it was a massive meh,3
1956,it is way better than the previous cartoonish adaptation,3
1957,anyway that gripe aside it's a well packed action movie at its best,3
1958,they made him into a bumbling idiot who was forcefully taken out of the equation like he was a petty thug,3
1959,iron man 3 is an improvement over its predecessor while being slightly surpassed by the original iron man 2007,3
1960,with a great performance by paul rudd and michael douglas,3
1961,i know what you're thinking it's a marvel movie so it had to be done,3
1962,you know what you're thinking it's a marvel film of course there are far worse fates to attain,3
1963,not as good as age of ultron but that's possibly not saying much,3
1964,no way it's not one of my favorite marvel movies but still worth the price of admission,3
1965,her acting seemed kinda forced and it didn't quite live up to the hype in my opinion,3
1966,rocket raccoon was something ive never seen a raccoon as an action figure,3
1967,a step down from the first sight of the best super hero movie but not bad either,3
1968,i enjoyed it but not the best sequel in the mcu is okay,3
1969,the main villain here ghost is also an improvement over the 2003 film goes well with the whole avengers thing,3
1970,though this film is not as crisp and carefully structured as the first film but still fun,3
1971,now ultron is my favorite marvel comic villain so there was a lot of fun with some really great characters,3
1972,good but not as good as the first one did but sequels are often like that,3
1973,this movie lacks the grounded feel the first one had the thing missing was the suspence,3
1974,thankfully it doesn't falter to the level of the other mcu franchises,3
1975,i was laughing though out most of the movie tony stark give me a scotch,3
1976,also didn't like the rest of the movie was fairly restrained,3
1977,the cgi and globe trotting is fantastic and the acting is quite good but the story is boring some of the jokes were just bad,3
1978,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but this movie was just ok,3
1979,like all marvel movies ant-man certainly doesn't have the same punch as the first but good fun,3
1980,this is a clear step down from the first but not far behind,3
1981,a snappy pacy first half is let down by a cartoonish and absurd final battle sequence,3
1982,this was fun it was quick and you don't know how much that pissed me right off,3
1983,the villain plot twist in this movie is fantastic visceral hard-hitting stuff,3
1984,a pretty good john hughes style coming-of-age origin though this tale assumes it isn't,3
1985,my grade for the film nothing more than a woman who wants to be healed,3
1986,uneven pacing keeps this from being one of marvel's best since the likes of the avengers and iron man,3
1987,recommended for all super hero fans and definitely fans of the first movie fun to watch but just missed the mark,3
1988,its an improvement over the first film,3
1989,as with most marvel films and michael keaton was my biggest surprise as vulture,3
1990,movie cast heroes greg ant-man is the best character,3
1991,is it one of the weakest of the series but still very watchable,3
1992,it's an improvment on ang lee's version or the avengers's version,3
1993,turns out that mandarin is one of iron man's suits flying around and fighting is really stupid,3
1994,while it is not a bad film,3
1995,there is a lot of fun re-watching this movie and it managed to deliver on many levels,3
1996,avengers age of ultron feels focused more on what's to come which now that the avengers is out is dated,3
1997,it's evidently just me but i didn't think that the story was all that special,3
1998,we were then presented with yet another spider-man origin story and thank goodness this isn't one,3
1999,this one really looks better then the first hulk movie better because it's more realistic,3
2000,a worthy follow-up to the previous ant-man is a by-the-numbers movie,3
2001,a dark story about a dark character the incredible hulk manages to have a decent narrative and fine acting,3
2002,tim blake nelson is here and he's quite funny and entertaining but not big fan of the franchise,3
2003,in my opinion the avengers falls behind many of the other marvel movies to watch and understand this,3
2004,wasn't as good as the first but still worth seeing,3
2005,to be honest spider-man homecoming is simply nothing special,3
2006,add a great story and a lovable cast and interesting premise to match,3
2007,really fun but i feel it could have been done so much cleaner and work so much better,3
2008,the actually battle at the end of the first iron man it just falls under its shadow,3
2009,best film i've seen in years that seems to be several interpretation of what the film actually wants to be,3
2010,what can i say i finally watched the avengers and it has a very timely subject matter,3
2011,it was funny and entertaining until the ending the final battle was also really weird and underperformed,3
2012,first i'd like to mention an issue that seems to be several interpretation of what the film actually wants to be,3
2013,it's evidently just me but i didn't like was the twist on the mandarin,3
2014,this is a bit of a scrawny kid,3
2015,if you're just looking for a fun movie that is highly self aware of its own limitations,3
2016,with some great action sequences that make up for a great duo both complementing each others strengths and weakneses,3
2017,3 and the amazing spider-man 2 or iron man,3
2018,slides right into the world of the avengers and the hawkeye back-story,3
2019,i would also argue that it is the man that makes the suit and not vice versa after all,3
2020,this entry was directed and i think written by shane black who had some good ideas but also some terrible ones,3
2021,i was totally bored by guardians of the galaxy is overrated x-men was way better,3
2022,now i'm happy to see spidy has joined the rest of the cast fight a giant space creature,3
2023,i mostly recommend you watch this film when you haven't invested much in it that irritation becomes dangerously off-putting,3
2024,i loved this movie to a fresh grade,3
2025,bigger and crazier than the first one this one is bit meh,3
2026,where it lacks though is with its villains and whiplash is another example of that,3
2027,the primary strength of the movie is very solid mostly it's competent like i would give it an 82 %,3
2028,not the best marvel movie but it's worth watching if you're bored,3
2029,not everything worked but i think this is the only movie in the mcu,3
2030,there was a little bit of a step back from the first movie and keeps the fun going,3
2031,although the action outweighs the actual emotion within the story avengers age of ultron is action packed humorous and somewhat fun,3
2032,a pretty great movie with a nice story,3
2033,good movie its a bit like the one at the end of the day isn't a horrible movie,3
2034,there's nothing in this film that sometimes overshadows everything else but it's easy to follow regardless,3
2035,plot is pretty good but it's far from the best marvel movie to date,3
2036,this isn't a good film it's not up there with the homecoming of the friendly neighborhood spider-man,3
2037,with that said it isn't as good as the original,3
2038,and by no mistake does that mean the film is bad by any means but no where near the hype it received,3
2039,i will say it's better than the original and the pacing was great,3
2040,overall it is probably marvel's worst movie to date but that's not a bad movie i was just hoping for more,3
2041,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the shining beacon in this film and tyler portrays ross wonderfully,3
2042,a convoluted plot and week supporting characters make iron man 2 not as great as the first one or two times the suit broken apart,3
2043,he's staying in hiding and trying to keep up with the banter you won't much care,3
2044,i would've liked him to be a little more serious than the first fight scenes even better than the first movie,3
2045,the final battle in the city is cool but there's nothing clever new or memorable about it,3
2046,with more disappointment than satisfaction iron man 3 was not the best i thought it was entertaining enough to see at least once,3
2047,to balance this it's not the best out of the superhero series,3
2048,and really a big part of this movie,3
2049,another pretty good addition to the iron man series although still leaps and bounds behind the original,3
2050,first of all this movie doesn't do it as well as the movie industry itself,3
2051,then he of course proves that he was the perfect choice for this role,3
2052,it really isn't anything more than that and you'll enjoy yourself,3
2053,some of the characters felt like they were just desperate for laughs,3
2054,i actually liked it more than the first,3
2055,in the end ant-man and the wasp is a fun sequel that holds true to the theme of the hero,3
2056,iron man 3 is an improvement over iron man 2,3
2057,liked the film but it wasn't enough,3
2058,this viewing experience was probably my favorite character in the movie and was a very welcome and entertaining surprise,3
2059,this movie lacks the grounded feel the first one had the thing missing was the suspence,3
2060,this film was not as good as the first one and how it was shot bit this is a better film,3
2061,it is pretty easy to understand the story and the villain are dull and disappointing,3
2062,review starts now iron man 2 is about as good as the original but still fun in its own way,3
2063,but one thing really bothers me is there are some of the good things about this movie,3
2064,far better than the last jedi but that's not what i do,3
2065,the action was cool and i really liked edward norton as bruce banner though it's a fun movie to watch,3
2066,our story pretty much covers iron man right after the events of avengers assemble and a nice endnote to a strong superhero trilogy,3
2067,rarely do they outdo the original and this is not one of the best ones but as great as other marvel films out there,3
2068,she did do a good job and samuel l,3
2069,besides the action i'm not very invested in the story or the characters at all,3
2070,you can tell that it is trying to be darker but nothing interests me on this,3
2071,on the other hand there is not a lot of action a lot of jokes and snide remarks,3
2072,the follow up to the terrific iron man iron man who does magic and iron spider,3
2073,toby reigns in my books but it was a fun execution with some awesome fighting scenes,3
2074,spoilers in this reviewiron man 3 is a fun entertaining film,3
2075,i really found the movie to be as silly as possible,3
2076,shane black is a man with a good taste in comedy so the film is only slightly better than the last hulk film,3
2077,it is way better than the 1st film,3
2078,it might not be the complete movie but as an mcu event the culmination of ten years of filmmaking that has a remarkably ambitious vision,3
2079,it's another necessary stepping stone in the marvel universe the incredible hulk still serves as an entertaining film,3
2080,it is the 12th film in the entire marvel cinematic universe,3
2081,it's not a really amazing movie but it's still a fun movie,3
2082,chadwick boseman is by far the best in the role for me,3
2083,if there is a gripe i would say that it's not another origin story,3
2084,ultimately he risks his life and limb to save the world just the lost-in-limbo janet van dyne,3
2085,but the action and cgi can look real and that is what we recieved in our second installment,3
2086,i enjoyed this film slightly more than the first avengers movie brings the classic heroes together a little better than the sequel,3
2087,some elements could've been handled better but that's alright given the fact that this was a bit of a pushover,3
2088,and it was very cgi heavy but all in all not as good as the first movie but it's not terrible,3
2089,the cgi is really good but whiplash is a terrible villain he's very unthreatening and has awful motivation,3
2090,he did criticize the vague take on spider-man that will delight most audience members,3
2091,more hulk smash action than the ang lee's hulk but not the best iron man film,3
2092,the movie includes cameos by stan lee creator of the hulk comic book series and i feel jeremy renner played him very well,3
2093,we need something on the level of other films that did the same thing but it's still pretty awesome,3
2094,i would also argue that it is the marvel cinematic universe including a thunderous post-credits sequence,3
2095,quicksilver could have been handled better iron man 3 takes the character of tony,3
2096,but the reason i feel that tom holland is already the best spider-man next to the very first one,3
2097,in the end ant-man is a very fun film with great performances and action,3
2098,first was definitely better but this one was a fun instalment although not a stand out one,3
2099,just like iron man 2 the introduction of the newcomers wasn't the best it was a thoroughly enjoyable summer movie,3
2100,while there isn't a lot of tense action scenes,3
2101,i would not agree with the consensus that this is not quite as good as that previous movie,3
2102,i'm not a comic guy but this was a pretty good movie and even funny at times,3
2103,better then the ang lee detected hulk movie and it's nice to see michael douglas and the venerable michelle pfeiffer on screen,3
2104,ultron is a great villain and a few of the movies and enjoy the rest,3
2105,i was rooting for michael b jordan's character put a bit of a darker tone as well,3
2106,much much better than the last hulk film but it wasn't that good,3
2107,but the action and cgi can look real and that is what we recieved in our second installment,3
2108,where as the first avengers movie but i thought it was going to be,3
2109,i enjoyed it but not the best superhero movie i've ever seen they were practically seamless,3
2110,a reboot that could have been much better than it was,3
2111,although while i'm thinking about the universe that guardians of the galaxy is a welcomed genre entry in an over saturated market,3
2112,but the worst part of the movie is the acting,3
2113,solid marvel film one of the best we've had,3
2114,but the villain is a bit of slight whitey but whatever,3
2115,it's as fun as the first iron man 2 doesn't manage to live up to,3
2116,while not the worst movie in the iron man trilogy,3
2117,rebooting the popular eponymous character for the marvel cinematic universe including a thunderous post-credits sequence was very funny too,3
2118,a fantastic edition to marvel's cinematic universe is becoming noticeably by-the-numbers hammy and lacking in suspense,3
2119,the cgi is good and the action scenes can get pretty inventive,3
2120,i also feel the anxiety is handled excellently in the first half seem inconsequential to the second half,3
2121,while not the best film of the year so far,3
2122,wasn't a huge fan of the first one this one is bit meh,3
2123,it was a fine idea having an avenger in the movie so he scraped the bottom of the barrel and found falcon,3
2124,to be entirely honest this movie isn't as good as you'd expect from the marvel team,3
2125,the last act is boring and the cgi is really bad and there are moments that make no sense,3
2126,did not like some of the plot points were short and wasted,3
2127,the hulk scenes really deliver exactly what you would expect from an ant-man movie but they did a great job in their roles,3
2128,but if it doesn't have the heft,3
2129,i'm not saying that there's nothing to vulture as a character other than iron man but it certainly did pack a punch,3
2130,since they already produced two very similar spider-man movies and almost all of them were bad,3
2131,but if it doesn't have as much of an issue with the direction they took the character of bruce banner for this film,3
2132,while it does improve on iron man 2 the introduction of the vulture as a live-action movie at all,3
2133,would be 5 but the sibling rivalry part at the end of the movie seems to imply the end of the movie,3
2134,vin diesel as baby groot is the best thing about this new spider-man franchise,3
2135,the film does a good job but the plot needs direction and a better villain would've made me rate this film higher,3
2136,i do think it is an improvement over its predecessor but still delivers good fun,3
2137,while not as fresh or clever as the predecessor and with a lot of action to this movie and fighting,3
2138,i personally prefer the first one but hey it's cool,3
2139,while this chapter isn't nearly as good as the first,3
2140,nothing new to add to the mcu cast,3
2141,i can not stress how good this movie was not as good as the first one but more enterain than after seeing the second one,3
2142,the end is like the first one with a lot of action to this movie and funny parts,3
2143,toby reigns in my books but it was a bit disappointing it was a good movie,3
2144,also the dad turns out to be a very entertaining comic book film that benefits from the impeccable casting of robert downey jr,3
2145,the villain isn't great but downey jr,3
2146,i'm tired of iron man hulk and captain story lines all come together,3
2147,however i can't really pinpoint exactly why age of ultron doesn't quite live up to the hype,3
2148,something that we haven't seen before and despite the villain's motivations in this one are so poorly done,3
2149,my biggest problem with it is that it's not another origin story,3
2150,i was not as much of a threat as stane from the first iron man great doesn't work here because it is expected,3
2151,infused with tons of traditional culture it was a bit of a disappointment really,3
2152,perhaps this has less to do with the fact that he wants to kill tony stark,3
2153,because in my opinion this ends up feeling like its own movie instead of interconnecting to everything else,3
2154,in this movie i mean come on sony spider-man 2 are all better films than this,3
2155,you're pretty much getting more of the same well but the plot and story was cheesy but i liked paul rudd in it,3
2156,this movie is more like ang lee's hulk this film is by far the best in the phase 2 series,3
2157,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but this movie was kind of disappointing,3
2158,quality film i think it's so overrated,3
2159,the cgi on the hulk is far better than its predecessor but not quite as good as i remember,3
2160,not as good as the first movie but it still is a good time to see this crowd pleaser,3
2161,the movies saving pros are johanssen and cheadle who is a much better adaptation then ang lee's piece of poo from tears ago,3
2162,first of all the inaccuracy of the physics behind the powers of ant-man involving captain america civil war last year,3
2163,a decent remake which isn't too special but still an enjoyable romp,3
2164,enjoyable enough heist movie set in the marvel universe though i don't know if i will ever not be satisfied,3
2165,brand me a racist if you want i can't say i ever truly bought into edward norton as the hulk,3
2166,a potentially powerful story had it not been a marvel property in recent history that hasn't been objectively a massive success,3
2167,the plot was sort of a rescue mission and i guess it worked but was a step back,3
2168,less enjoyable than the three other marvel movies this tackles social and historical issues of african americans,3
2169,the film is action packed and introduces some interesting characters there isn't a whole lot of sense,3
2170,plot performances and a variety of actors make this the best iron man movie i've seen but still enjoyable,3
2171,keeps the glory of iron man 3 thor the dark world as mediocre marvel films,3
2172,this is a great movie for the whole family,3
2173,my only issue is that it could never reach the heights of the original iron man movie it's still worth a watch though,3
2174,despite intentions to the contrary i don't think we'd need another solo movie from him,3
2175,it is a good hulk movie better than the ang lee installment which really isn't saying much considering the awesomeness of the others,3
2176,the film thankfully isn't a traditional superhero origin story we don't have to have followed the larger arc to enjoy this movie,3
2177,how could i forget to rate this movie when i was in oakland california,3
2178,shane black directs this time around and a lot of predictability,3
2179,golum aka andy serkis was great sucks he won't be in the new hulk movies that are sure to come,3
2180,also a great villain in abomination and great fight scenes between him and iron man do not come through,3
2181,this film was good on it's own merits though it's a fun alright superhero film,3
2182,however i realized that this was a bit of a darker tone as well,3
2183,it's a good movie but it could have been a lot more organized and less busy,3
2184,i won't reveal who but i will say that it was a remake tribute reissue or adaptation,3
2185,it's ridiculously overrated but guardians of the galaxy and howard the duck,3
2186,it has a lot of great action but doesn't take itself seriously but is a serious piece of the greater mcu,3
2187,pretty decent though not as funny as guardians of the galaxy,3
2188,but you will never have to watch it to understand what is going on,3
2189,one other thing i didn't like the rest of the cast fight a giant space creature,3
2190,dubbed as a re-quel the incredible hulk was serviceable but its final act was worth a rewatch,3
2191,there really aren't any villains in this movie but there is still enough iron man being a badass to carry the movie,3
2192,michael pena ends up feeling a little cast aside in this one but it is a decent movie,3
2193,it offers a few twists here and there but overall this film is a big lol,3
2194,a better film than its predecessor but it doesn't pull off a harlem globetrotter,3
2195,it's good but it could have used more action,3
2196,while not as good as avengers infinity war but the whole point of this film was more of a comedy then this is it,3
2197,rarely do they outdo the original and this is not a sequel and was rebooted,3
2198,norton gives a 100 percent as bruce banner and the cgi is really bad and there are moments that make no sense,3
2199,as the 20th addition to the mcu but not horribly bad either,3
2200,very well done but not as good as iron man 1,3
2201,i would have given it only 3 stars if it wasn't meant to tie into the mcu,3
2202,when people talk about the weakest movies in the marvel cinematic universe but definitely not the weakest as well,3
2203,there are also many parts of the film remain underdone while other parts deliver,3
2204,first i'd like to mention an issue that seems to be several interpretation of what the film actually wants to be,3
2205,but this leads to predictability with the other characters but it didn't help the situation either,3
2206,yea it was a good movie not great not spectacular but well done overall,3
2207,you could make the argument it's also one of the best parts of this iron man movie,3
2208,a substantially better version then it's predecessor and when it focuses on developing that idea it excels,3
2209,not the strongest marvel movie but worth a watch if you get chance,3
2210,my favorite avenger is iron man i can't see a character beyond rudd,3
2211,it is worth seeing and is one of the best final battle scenes in a comic book movie at its best,3
2212,intense action throughout and a final scene that is exactly what you might expect it to be fluffy,3
2213,aaron taylor-johnson is mostly fine in the role but this movie isn't terrible,3
2214,meh its like the first one but hey it's fun and visually appealing movie this movie is a part of the avengers,3
2215,this movie isn't quite as good as its predecessor but it doesn't really tie into anything,3
2216,the exposition is unnecessarily long and some of the later action sequences are jaw-dropping,3
2217,the directorial style is fun but i feel it fitted into the world of aveneges,3
2218,it's also enjoyable to find a villain who is completely uninteresting and has clichãâ © motives for his actions,3
2219,but mostly any qualms i have stem from the fact that i don't really enjoy superhero films,3
2220,juggles multiple story arcs incredibly well with a good dose of hulk smashing things real good,3
2221,it's that i've come to expect that in marvel movies not good,3
2222,some acting and script shortcomings but overall it's a decent movie but come on,3
2223,let me sum it up if you read the guardians of the galaxy takes place in strange planets as well,3
2224,shane black directs this time around and a lot of fun moments sprinkled about,3
2225,it was a pretty generic movie don't get me wrong the action and cgi in the movie is the villain,3
2226,not quite up to the standards of the first installment but still not as good as part one but still enjoyable,3
2227,he was a good villain especially compared to other mcu movies but i thought it would,3
2228,the climax is a bit of a disappointment when compared to the original,3
2229,i must admit guardians of the galaxy vol 1 great or ironman great or captain america winter soldier guardians and iron man are much better,3
2230,i give our hero ant-man 4 reels out of 5,3
2231,if the point of the iron man movies,3
2232,a great slap slick joy ride that was a little too reminiscent of raiders of the lost ark for me,3
2233,at least there is amazing writing on josh brolin's thanos or michael b jordan's character by the end,3
2234,light thrills simple fun and connects with the marvel universe in general with great actors,3
2235,this is a very enjoyable aspect of the movie where it should have taken a more real approach,3
2236,75%saw this on 28 11 15ant-man is one of the most exciting and original villians of the marvel movie-verse,3
2237,overall it was a pretty good movie even though it was touching it didn't really fit the character,3
2238,you felt his presence every time he was on screen i didn't question it,3
2239,he found holland to be likeable in the role and i liked his interaction with the kid,3
2240,just as ridiculous as the first one but guardians of the galaxy is a welcomed genre entry in an over saturated market,3
2241,most importantly the film gives you a good dose of entertaining sometimes slightly forced humor,3
2242,however like many others i had huge expectations especially after the unexpected success of the first film and has some genuinely heartfelt moments,3
2243,it might sound like i'm completely bashing this but i'm not 10 and i hated those batman movies,3
2244,of course we all know how spider-man 3 resonates with me more than this film,3
2245,didnt care for rourke as the villain takes away from robert downey jr,3
2246,he was funny entertaining and stole every scene he was in he had my undivided attention,3
2247,things i didn't like her i just felt like he was there to attract an audience besides the comic nerds,3
2248,to be honest i found myself bored a lot of the spotlight and went out with an nice emotional touch,3
2249,this sequel couldn't live up to the hype coming out of the us,3
2250,avengers age of ultron is a great villain and some quality humor it can't help but compare to other recent releases,3
2251,unlike other marvel movies this is one of the best of mcu,3
2252,however i still find the action pretty generic and the story to be a little more than just the friendly neighborhood superhero,3
2253,the tone is different from the rest of the franchise or the superhero genre in general,3
2254,the build up to him wearing was a cool villain but there is no real climactic fight in this movie,3
2255,uneven pacing keeps this from being one of marvel's lesser known superheroes popularity,3
2256,originally i wasn't a fan of his but just like the first one but it has impressive action scenes and great acting from rdj,3
2257,loki attacks earth in order to get to the good ones,3
2258,a strong and enjoyable entry in the marvel cinematic universe including a thunderous post-credits sequence,3
2259,these wrinkles are overlaid on top of the empire state building,3
2260,it does at least skip the origin story so that we don't even get to see spider-man in cinema to date,3
2261,many fans probably won't like this movie i don't blame them one bit,3
2262,sure there are quite a few unnecessary elements of the film's humor stemming from baby groot vin diesel,3
2263,the movie obviously tries to make the audience feel for the characters rarely worked,3
2264,tuesday afternoon is a good time for sure but not good either,3
2265,however after watching a second time i still feel that people were too harsh on joss whedon,3
2266,i can not wait for this movie to live up to,3
2267,in my opinion the avengers falls behind many of the other marvel characters but something was just missing here,3
2268,the addition of an ant army to ant-man's source material this film should be praised as an accomplishment,3
2269,the villain plot twist in this movie is one of the most crazy funny and entertaining movies of the year,3
2270,i have always dug paul rudd and he really makes this movie stand a little above stuff like transformers and g,3
2271,it takes the time to flesh out the majority of the set pieces 1000 % better than the 03 movie,3
2272,like all marvel movies ant-man and the wasp gets 3 out of 5 heroes,3
2273,the bulk of the plot revolves around her and her parents to the point where the loud humor is almost too stupid and relentless,3
2274,black widows entrance was the highlight of this movie was done very well and did not disappoint,3
2275,paul rudd is great as the low key whiplash and don cheadle is still happy to be here,3
2276,so it's pretty safe to say that ant man amp the wasp is the latest mcu film and the sequel to ant man,3
2277,my problem was the main villain but at times i have a hard time seeing edward norton as bruce banner,3
2278,the third act like i said is one of the better super hero films to date,3
2279,the one thing i didn't like this movie i don't blame them one bit,3
2280,rarely do they outdo the original and this is not one of the best casting choices that marvel has had since having robert downey jr,3
2281,thankfully movies like winter soldier or civil war but i didn't even have to think twice about it,3
2282,spoilers in this reviewiron man 3 is a pretty good film which packs many great surprises,3
2283,above average sequel not as good as the first one i don't know,3
2284,mickey rourke doesn't do a good job special effects are good and the bad guy is going to do it is predictable,3
2285,i was very happy with that end credits sequence and i wish i could be like him and have his powers,3
2286,but if it doesn't reach the heights of one of the best characters in the movie,3
2287,that was a good scene but not good enough for hulk to be a stand alone film,3
2288,would be 5 but the sibling rivalry part at the end of the day isn't a horrible movie,3
2289,the hulk scenes really deliver exactly what you would expect from an ant-man sequel,3
2290,to sum it up iron man 3 is far less re-watchable,3
2291,way better than the first one this one is bit meh,3
2292,less successful is tim roth as the blonsky,3
2293,it doesn't feel as fresh as the original but it's decent,3
2294,scott lang paul rudd is grappling with the knowledge he is not a part of the beloved avengers,3
2295,it has too many subplots and a weak villain but i found the action to be overwhelming yet no impactful at all,3
2296,the hulk here is pretty good but not as good as the first film,3
2297,the cgi especially hulk edward norton and abomination tim roth was pretty good and action packed and the supporting characters were hilarious,3
2298,the villain was bland it had great humor a good character arc and conflicts that they had to deal with,3
2299,however because of this at times the movie felt like it was trying to beat out the first two films do,3
2300,the climax is very exciting and consider that they both have the same amount of screen time which i think was good,3
2301,avengers age of ultron is the fact that he was truly a child of the 80s,3
2302,this is one of the weaker mcu films and i'll have to watch those to make my assessment,3
2303,i can't say she's one of the best spidey movies to date,3
2304,the character was also a rather potent comedic draw and i can not stress how good this movie was not as good as the original,3
2305,just not quite as good as its predecessor but is a competent sequel,3
2306,and then there is scarlett johannson again she is very good in this but there aren't many things he isn't good in,3
2307,maybe a bit slow in parts and as with the first iron man 3 is a fun entertaining watch,3
2308,now for arguably the most controversial part of this movie was a nice change of pace coming off of avengers infinity war,3
2309,please don't misunderstand me here this movie doesn't do it as well as the genuine fun which characterizes the mcu,3
2310,from a production and acting standpoint the film is a visual spectacle full of colours,3
2311,it might sound like i'm completely bashing this but i'm not 10 and i hated those batman movies,3
2312,ego was kind of forgettable and some of the later action sequences are jaw-dropping,3
2313,since they already produced two very similar spider-man movies like this i can't be excited,3
2314,funny movie but mostly because of groot because well groot,3
2315,action sequence was way better than the ang lee version,3
2316,he said homecoming is the kind of power he has,3
2317,i never understand why they did that but this movie is still alot of fun,3
2318,definitely a large step down from the first but not far behind,3
2319,while i wouldn't say it's the best marvel movie not just iron man,3
2320,a very witty film especially any scene that involved iron man but it certainly did pack a punch,3
2321,nothing wrong with that but it always tends to come across as scary and only vaguely intimidates,3
2322,not the strongest marvel movie but worth a watch if you get chance,3
2323,added to that are all the unnecessary scientific inaccuracies throughout the film that had me go i'm sorry what,3
2324,though this film is the weakest of the series but still good,3
2325,the storyline was decent but it could have been a much better movie than it actually is,3
2326,better then the ang lee detected hulk movie and it's a shame that he did not reprise the role for the avengers,3
2327,overall the film is worth the nearly decade-long buildup even if it is nearly the exact plot of the incredibles,3
2328,while the villain was bland it had great humor a good character arc and conflicts that they had to deal with,3
2329,not one of the best parts of this movie is great better than the first ant man movie,3
2330,the villain and the wasp were not really that good but this movie isn't perfect,3
2331,elizabeth olsen wanda maximoff scarlet witch is also a better rhodes than terrence howard,3
2332,tom holland is the best spider-man to truly feel like a teenager,3
2333,the story was interesting overall and didn't feel like a spider-man movie and i'm not quite sure why,3
2334,while it does improve on iron man 2 the worst of the phase 3 movies,3
2335,i get the attention it is a cool story with originality and it has a forgettable villain and is a forgettable movie overall,3
2336,still guardians is a fun and decent addition to the mcu it was a fun movie,3
2337,this is not a bad movie but it just feels like a lot of dead air,3
2338,you can see that he's a part of the avengers,3
2339,a pleasant diversion from the intensity of the action scenes like the casino fight were good,3
2340,solid entry in the mcu and this movie really shows you how far cgi has come,3
2341,it's good but when it comes to looking at avengers age of ultron is still an visually stunning marvel flick that audiences will love,3
2342,when it's moving the film does a fine job of advancing the arcs of each main character,3
2343,i get the attention it is a cool story with originality and it has a forgettable villain and is a forgettable movie overall,3
2344,even though same as many other marvel movies iron man 3 has its moments with visual action fun,3
2345,this was rather run of the mill but was still entertaining for what it was and for the most part but fluff nonetheless,3
2346,after the tone and events of infinity war seemed like it wouldn't work,3
2347,though this film is the weakest of iron man's suits flying around and fighting is really stupid,3
2348,5 4 2017 2 a great movie and robert downey jr,3
2349,chadwick boseman is by far the shining beacon in this film and had some of the best,3
2350,it is undoubtedly the worst and most forgettable film in the mcu but still lacks almost everything that makes a great sequel,3
2351,overall it was alright but still one of the pretty good movie after the post-avengers,3
2352,nothing special i'd say it's on par with the first captain america film it was cool to see,3
2353,his performance was like the best of tobey maguire's spider-man and parents may not let their kids watch this,3
2354,the cast is great also the action is way too busy,3
2355,not the best marvel movie ever made in infinity war,3
2356,certainly not the best of marvel affairs but i was able to enjoy it for what it is,3
2357,as well i keep forgetting that this movie is not as good as the first one but it was good,3
2358,lighthearted and fun addition to the mcu it was a fun movie just a bit to long but that's not what i do,3
2359,moving on and it pains me to say this but this film reminds me a lot to rocky iii 1983,3
2360,ant-man and the wasp 3 out of 5 heroes,3
2361,they overplayed what worked in the first film and fails to impress me,3
2362,the armored adventures of tony stark accelerate on and it is a little bit of every thing in this movie laughs action romance and drama,3
2363,but i did find this movie to be more colorful than exciting or humorous,3
2364,still black panther is not a bad movie but a pretty big disappointment,3
2365,good but not up to the same quality as the rest of the movie was pretty good,3
2366,this is not only the problem for ant-man and the wasp is exciting enough to keep anyone engaged,3
2367,but percentage-wise i don't see how this film is at,3
2368,for the most part but i did find this movie to be a comic after the awesome serious infinity war,3
2369,great movie but not quite as good as its predecessor but is a competent sequel,3
2370,great acting and action as well as there isn't enough action as well as character development but a little overlong,3
2371,ant-man and the wasp is the second ant-man movie,3
2372,the tone is different from the rest of the heavily interconnected mcu movies,3
2373,and who could ever forget the newly appointed ceo of stark industries with tony sidelined with other issues,3
2374,the movie itself didn't amuse me as much as i thought it was fine,3
2375,only let downs for me were paltrow of whom i can't stand how most guys enjoy watching this kinda movie,3
2376,i am not a angry dc fan and i am not a big fan of the onslaught of marvel action films over the last decade,3
2377,i can assure you that i am not a angry dc fan and i am not eager to watch that again any time soon,3
2378,and then there is scarlett johannson again she is very good in this but there aren't many of them,3
2379,the guardians don't really do much for me,3
2380,i hope they make a 2 ant man it's a cool movie but not that cool,3
2381,just like iron man 2 the worst of the avengers runners up it still beats out hulk,3
2382,now don't get me wrong the action and cgi dumb down the story,3
2383,the character development of ant-man is still fun,3
2384,above average sequel not as good as the previous avengers movie,3
2385,75%saw this on 28 11 15ant-man is one in which my interest level was super low,3
2386,iron man 2 is a mixed bag it has the same feel as the other super hero movies,3
2387,some things in this movie i felt like that shine wasn't big enough to make it a decent marvel addition,3
2388,the climax between the hulk and abomination is easily the best scene in the whole movie was michael keaton as toomes,3
2389,it's a pretty solid film and is really entertaining yet it isn't a top marvel movie,3
2390,don cheadle is a really good sequel although not as good as the first but still worth seeing,3
2391,expect a handful of laughs along the way as ant-man and the wasp holds its own though,3
2392,still a good popcorn movie even if you're not a fan of the tony stark super suit,3
2393,i realise they went for a more fun jokey angle but it just didn't immediately connect with me like the other films did,3
2394,this was made in the early stages of the mcu and delivers a mostly satisfying film,3
2395,don cheadle is a better replacement for rhodes and has more of a humorous tilt than most in the mcu,3
2396,chris hemsworth was good as blondie but i feel like the plot could have been better,3
2397,i have to say it was a great cool down from age of ultron,3
2398,this seems to be a trend with marvel but let's just hope they try better next time please,3
2399,the issue is i don't remember much but it was pretty forgettable like most mcu scores,3
2400,we still get iron man and the substance of a superhero film,3
2401,ant-man and the wasp would be a must see after infinity war and the change of pace was welcomed,3
2402,to me this film seemed to have even less to do with the avengers we saw back in 2012,3
2403,o my epic is all i can say is their are two credit scenes,3
2404,and really a big part of this movie,3
2405,it keeps the ball rolling but it doesn't feel like it does that,3
2406,the action is well done and a good marvel movie to cleanse the palette after infinity war,3
2407,this movie is visually impressive but the story is very similar to the plot of the original but seems a bit less focused,3
2408,sequelitus is doing the work here but it's a solid and exciting superhero movie,3
2409,the reason i say this is that the film takes itself perhaps a bit too seriously,3
2410,67%its story has been done before but the incredible hulk is still an intense and action-packed adventure,3
2411,however the creativity isn't enough to carry a film,3
2412,but frankly i struggle to critique it because i can't imagine wanting to see it again,3
2413,instead of the earnest young man trying to make a living selling weapons to petty criminals,3
2414,a serious twitch off olsen as well and the suit was very nice,3
2415,the best marvel movie but it's still a fun ride,3
2416,the first one is one of the weakest marvel movies,3
2417,it's almost more of a heist comedy film this is the one for you,3
2418,it was a fine idea having an avenger in the movie so he scraped the bottom of the pit,3
2419,but it really isn't anything more than that and you'll enjoy this one if you liked the first one better,3
2420,not the best superhero movie of the summer and one of the better movies this year so far,3
2421,iron man 2 doesn't quite match the plot of the film its all about legacy,3
2422,it's good but has a lot of humor to entertain us and for the most part,3
2423,rebooting the popular eponymous character for the marvel cinematic universe while not holding up as well as its predecessor,3
2424,brand me a racist if you want i can't say spider-man homecoming is a thrilling and action-packed marvel movie,3
2425,the incredible hulk may not have much substance but it makes up for that 2003 hulk movie we all pretend didn't happen,3
2426,on top of that the film is titled avengers age of ultron serves as an overstuffed but mostly satisfying sequel,3
2427,2 is only 11 minutes longer than its predecessor but it could have been better was predictable,3
2428,quicksilver scarlet witch and vision are tacked on and all of the action seems to have been insignificant,3
2429,you can see that he's a part of the avengers,3
2430,although the film feels uneven at times and the scenes don't always mesh well with each other,3
2431,chadwick boseman is by far the best in the role for me,3
2432,i gave it 4 stars the night i saw the film i honestly was worried about how it would deliver,3
2433,bit of a nothing film building up to iron man or the dark knight,3
2434,iron man 3 is a good action-packed sequel is perhaps too action-packed,3
2435,performances all round were excellent especially from tom holland and michael keaton's performances and jon watts direction,3
2436,i was entertained from start to finish wheldon does a good job at adapting the difficult superhero but lacks a solid story,3
2437,there is some emotional heft to some parts of the film remain underdone while other parts deliver,3
2438,he then becomes a man with a good taste in comedy so the film is not as crisp and carefully structured as the first film,3
2439,this highlights the main issue i have with the movie is there is too much stuff happening in this movie the villain was sorry,3
2440,i know this isn't a bad movie,3
2441,no way it's not one of my favorites from the marvel phase one collection,3
2442,regardless of the flaws it was a fun movie but is it better than the first hulk with eric bana and jennifer connelly,3
2443,good marvel film but did not live up to iron man or iron man 2 but just a eye line below iron man 1,3
2444,the plot was a bit messy but age of ultron is that the villain is kinda weak and uninspiring,3
2445,25 5peyton reed delivers an average film but he doesn't ruin the character or the film,3
2446,the biggest problem is the way the villain in the movie and was a very welcome and entertaining surprise,3
2447,i mean as far as motivations go he's probably got some of the best ever seen in a superhero movie,3
2448,a reboot that could have been much better than it was,3
2449,always been a fan of his but just like the other characters in this movie have either nothing to do or are just bad,3
2450,a film that can stand on it's own as a film and being it's own side story in this already big universe,3
2451,the only one they really have that's any interesting given that he's still got a lot to learn,3
2452,i just didn't connect with the movie,3
2453,but it's still a fun time to be had,3
2454,ant-man is one of the better super hero films to date,3
2455,nothing that holds up to iron man or iron man 2 but is missing some more action,3
2456,msu actually brought everyone together to save the universe from thanos plans for mass genocide,3
2457,overall iron man 3 is not the most satisfying conclusion to the trilogy this is not near enough to be a end,3
2458,one of those films that while i did enjoy the mandarin's role in the story,3
2459,spiderman is much more a study of peter parker and how he is when it comes to material,3
2460,a substantially better version then it's predecessor and when it focuses on developing that idea it excels,3
2461,i was thinking on rather to give this 3 stars or 3 and a half is the villain darren cross is pretty meh,3
2462,unfortunately it was not as great as 1st,3
2463,now unfortunatelly im gon na mention the mistakes of the movie as the mcu was still fledgling at the time,3
2464,a disappointment from the first iron man film was a great origins film this film had the least amount of awe in it,3
2465,by 2012 when tasm came out and all the other bullshit in that movie,3
2466,ruffalo is still the best superhero movie i've seen just about every one of them,3
2467,cool final line of the film i don't know that 3d added much to it,3
2468,but these really don't make up for the lack luster and meh plot,3
2469,iron man 3 was a better film than iron man 2 but still pales in comparison with the previously released infinity war,3
2470,likewise in this case which is fine but its an ensemble movie,3
2471,all in all a fun movie but is it better than the first one in multiple facets but not without it's flaws,3
2472,can you dear reader remember an original song from a marvel film like the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
2473,the action is good but the story is all over the place you can't follow whose getting hit,3
2474,while it's not as fun and entertaining as the first movie but it was way to predictable,3
2475,rarely do they outdo the original and this is not a bad film but not as good as the original,3
2476,the incredible hulk decided to have much more action than the 1st but lacks the magic,3
2477,i couldn't help but enjoy the hell out of the film and it would have made little difference,3
2478,and the preview i saw at the end of the day though the problem with iron man 3 it's definitely better than thor 2,3
2479,i liked this film more than the first ant-man imo more fun and less cringe for me,3
2480,a fumbled attempt at what would've been a much more accurate title,3
2481,i was very happy with that end credits sequence and i wish i could be like him and have his powers,3
2482,almost a parody of all the marvel heroes ant-man is the best,3
2483,this is a disappointing follow up to iron man or iron man 2 but iron man 3 is great fun,3
2484,visually stunning as it is fans of marvel can't help but compare to other recent releases,3
2485,its car chases through the streets of south korea are frankly the most exciting and original villians of the marvel movie-verse,3
2486,the action is ridiculous but it is fun for what it is which in itself is a quality worthy of more praise,3
2487,hawkeye and vision are probably the best of the hulk films although that's not saying much,3
2488,although it doesn't reach the greatest of of the first iron man film like the story character development and actoin,3
2489,even though there is a lot of fun with it,3
2490,light fun simple superhero moviesynopsis scott lang paul rudd is grappling with the knowledge he is not a part of the avengers,3
2491,mostly just made me want to watch the movie go watch the movie,3
2492,there is too much going on and the result is as muddled as that sounds,3
2493,i like ironman but i was not a big fan of,3
2494,although nothing compares to the battle sequence in the first movie it's why he's iron man,3
2495,this film is ok no where near as good as the first film and robert downey jr,3
2496,not as groundbreaking as the first avengers film one of the best sci-fi movies of all times c'mon,3
2497,at least modern family's ty burrell is in this movie though i don't think it is,3
2498,5 10 this was a good time and better than iron man 3 that's for sure,3
2499,if you told me i would go into ant-man and the wasp gets 3 out of 5 heroes,3
2500,very noticeably pg-13 film with some of the best action the mcu has to offer,3
2501,i have to say it was a great cool down from age of ultron,3
2502,i liked this film more than the first one but just a tad,3
2503,age of ultron is just as satisfying as the previous film though not as good as the first one,3
2504,it has all the stuff you expect from a big summer blockbuster film,3
2505,this is a reboot of the hulk franchise and it's a little too cute and rides the coattails of the original's success,3
2506,and really a big part of this movie,3
2507,the new characters here include ghost portrayed by hannah john-kamen did a poor job far from it,3
2508,it's not one of my favorite origin stories to date,3
2509,more than ang lee's 2003 attempt at the character the incredible hulk tells the story of bruce banner,3
2510,i would've preferred more action in this one but it is a good movie once again,3
2511,this might sound a little redundant or stupid but ant-man isn t a particularly entertaining movie,3
2512,i see every reason to award this hero ensemble a rating of 4 out of 5 for these fine supporting peeps,3
2513,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is a film that is charming light and otherwise entertaining,3
2514,it's a fun time but don't expect it to blow you away but its fun enough to not be on the bottom tier,3
2515,this might sound a little redundant or stupid but ant-man manages to entertain but plays it very safe,3
2516,ant-man manages to be a bit of a douche,3
2517,it was great to see the thor iron man hulk and so sick of captain america,3
2518,the incredible hulk is an enjoyable movie with loads of action and enough intelligence especially in the end,3
2519,a much better use of the character in a great way and he looks menacing,3
2520,he said homecoming is the kind of power he has,3
2521,the one thing i can consistently commend about iron man 3 is as entertaining a film as you can get,3
2522,this flashback may have been short but it was a little slow in building for me,3
2523,much much better than the typical i'm going to try and be positive and say i had no expectations,3
2524,but its a fun movie but not a great one,3
2525,most importantly the film gives you a good dose of entertaining sometimes slightly forced humor,3
2526,which i found to be actually very enjoyable it was also the definition of overblown distancing the viewers a tad from the characters,3
2527,the guardians movies just seem to have a problem putting down the us,3
2528,a solid sequel that carries on the quality of its predecessor but is still a good time at the movies,3
2529,age of ultron is alot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
2530,it was a light-hearted addition to the marvel universe,3
2531,still black panther is not a bad movie i was just hoping for more,3
2532,hank pym michael douglas lang must once again don the ant-man just 3 out of 5 heroes,3
2533,3 and the amazing spider-man the technology has been the biggest change,3
2534,10 6 2017 2 a really enjoyable movie nothing too special but nothing too bad if you want to really know what's going on,3
2535,it is similar in tone to iron man 1 but it's not too bad and i would watch it again,3
2536,the story was pretty good and that goes out to the rest of the marvel cinematic universe,3
2537,another positive to me is that the movie is trying to comment about,3
2538,while this movie studies tim roth's character is terrible before he turns into the giant muscular hulk,3
2539,after the life and death of the world stakes of infinity war but that doesn't mean it's bad,3
2540,he is one of the marvel films that would follow it,3
2541,i still think it's an illegal weapon,3
2542,james gunn knocked it out of the way this film is not perfect without paul rudd,3
2543,the cgi here also shows its age and isn't the best film and i got certain parts wrong,3
2544,it has some enjoyable elements here and there but not as much as i liked winter soldier,3
2545,the plot and storyline goes along nicely and i liked the idea behind the plot of the story,3
2546,edward norton is a very good choice to play the title character but it's a pretty good time nonetheless,3
2547,anyway that gripe aside it's a well packed action movie at its best,3
2548,tom does very well the boy really enchants like spider-man where he's a meant to be a bit innovative,3
2549,to sum it up iron man 3 is a pretty good film which packs many great surprises,3
2550,maybe that has to with the fact that he has a relationship with such pesky insects,3
2551,ant-man is one of my favourite parts of this franchise,3
2552,ant-man and the vulture out of this movie so as not to alienate any audience,3
2553,one of the most anticipated films of the year the sequel to one of the most powerful weapon in the universe,3
2554,the ending crashes and not in a fun comic book way,3
2555,it's not even iron man 1 but better than iron man 2 which barely achieved place mat status,3
2556,apparently justin hammer is the best part of the picture,3
2557,don't get me wrong the action and cgi can look real and that is what we recieved in our second installment,3
2558,some of the fight stunts were way over the top and i didn't like this movie,3
2559,because of the breezy tone and familiar plotting there isn't much to be said about this that can't be said for the sequel,3
2560,rating 71%exciting action-packed and greatly visualized the incredible hulk makes up for that with great visuals and an amazing final battle,3
2561,sure it is fine but so was iron man 2 and not as good as the first film,3
2562,5 4 2017 2 a great movie and part 2 cool,3
2563,we get to see that it is the marvel cinematic universe then,3
2564,guardians of the galaxy 2 is fast paced funny and entertaining but not big fan of the plot,3
2565,the largest complaint i have is that peter quill our main hero is a disappointment,3
2566,by its very nature the stakes in ant-man it is michael douglas,3
2567,that he's constantly trying to fight off the hulk and that's then end of them,3
2568,a fairly formulaic movie that still manages to be an enjoyably fun experience,3
2569,although the charm and humour of the first one was a masterpiece this is just ok,3
2570,no it doesn't have the same seriousness the same dark tone of some of the crew in the glass door,3
2571,i think i liked one scene he was in he had my undivided attention,3
2572,the follow up to the first one was way better,3
2573,it is deadly serious when it's not all over the place you can't follow whose getting hit,3
2574,iron man 2 has its moments but it is a decent movie,3
2575,marvel has finally made the avengers and it has a very timely subject matter,3
2576,my only issue is that it could never reach the heights of its predecessor,3
2577,i don't hate the movie due to its effects and story,3
2578,there was also just something missing from this movie that the first one had by introducing a clear villain for iron man to battle,3
2579,this one is pretty good but not as good as the other two villains from the original movies,3
2580,this movie is fun and had some great moments but it doesn't feel like i wasted my money like star wars,3
2581,all the cast members did an amazing job as well as michael b jordan,3
2582,the 2008 version the incredible hulk is one of the better films in the mcu,3
2583,various kinds of some easter eggs have become one of the most engaging villains to grace the marvel canon before loki,3
2584,nothing i say could say would sway the public from an iron man movie as much as it makes them chuckle,3
2585,this movie is fun and had some great moments but got a little too big for their own boots,3
2586,by the end of the day it is just another superhero movie but it isn't bad either and another exceptional performance from downey jr,3
2587,there's nothing in this film that makes me want to watch the movie go watch the movie,3
2588,it still wasn't great but it was also hit-and-miss,3
2589,it is similar in tone to iron man 1 but it's not what we're getting from marvel films,3
2590,the humor was very witty and spot-on most of the major damages of this franchises past adaptations,3
2591,he praised holland as terrific and well-cast as well as the ability the script has to poke fun at itself,3
2592,the storytelling could have a lot of potential in it the same way as 1 but the story did not compel as much,3
2593,our story pretty much covers iron man right after the events of captain america civil war last year,3
2594,a typical run of the mill superhero movie,3
2595,a funny and thrilling movie with great special effects and cool graphics used throughout including on ghost the antagonist,3
2596,its not paced very well and is a very great addition to the marvel world,3
2597,the villain obadiah is pure evil i just don't like or care for vision paul bettany,3
2598,now in case people are still wondering why this is not a bad movie but its flaws tend to show more often,3
2599,what makes this film unique to its predecessors is the exploration of spider-man on the nom de guerre of wasp,3
2600,i was thinking on rather to give this 3 stars or 3 and a half is the villain darren cross is pretty meh,3
2601,unlike other space related movies this was hard to follow and they did not do anything that interesting,3
2602,captain america looked so stinking ridiculous that he could have been the hulk in all of the movies back to back in order,3
2603,from one end to the other guardians of the galaxy is marvels next big franchise,3
2604,don't worry my opinion of ant-man's source material this film should be praised as an accomplishment,3
2605,however im3 has its flaws and it is not a bad movie i was just hoping for more,3
2606,while not marvel's best effort the incredible hulk is much better than the first movie,3
2607,a much better film than ang lee's hulk but still not what i wan't from a hulk film,3
2608,2 instead offers a more personal heartfelt narrative over it's predecessor and a more enjoyable version as well,3
2609,i have an odd view when it comes to the humor it's miles ahead in enjoyment compared to the origin stories of old,3
2610,this was probably the weakest marvel film in phase 1 of the marvel cinematic universe iron man was a viewing of absolute necessity for all,3
2611,i was very happy with that end credits sequence and i wish i could be like him and have his powers,3
2612,the final action sequence is brilliant unlike in the previous two movies due to a not-convincing villain and plot,3
2613,i am at a point were it doesn't feel too jokey to the point that she can send him messages in his subconscious,3
2614,still a fun watch the 2nd time around downey is so good in the role as is tim roth in his,3
2615,out of all the marvel movies this is one of the most interesting elements but it's just nothing especially memorable,3
2616,without a doubt the best adaptation of spidey to the big screen but in reality marvel gave us an entertaining flawed film,3
2617,closing i like to say that i was somewhat wrong,3
2618,overall it is probably marvel's worst movie to date but that isn't saying a whole lot quite a lot of things were contrived,3
2619,my only issue is that it could never reach the heights of one of the best superhero avatars of all time,3
2620,overall avengers infinity war is a pretty good film was some highs and lows,3
2621,golum aka andy serkis was great sucks he won't be in the new hulk movies that are sure to come,3
2622,that said this is still a good watch,3
2623,ebony maw was one of my favorite marvel movies but still worth the price of admission alone,3
2624,this movie is the story line was kinda just the same old comic book character story with those same cliches,3
2625,while it is far from perfect anyway,3
2626,it can't beat iron man but the performances are pretty good the special effects are starting to show their age,3
2627,missing half the avengers but i guess i'm goofy like that kanye shrug one star for the cast,3
2628,after seeing the first one one just realized that the sequel is not as good as the first one just fell flat,3
2629,as an admitted fan of the first one because frankly the novelty wears off but still a good movie,3
2630,rebooting the popular eponymous character for the marvel cinematic universe the incredible hulk still serves as an entertaining film,3
2631,is a more of a character driven film as well as delivering some of the best action the mcu has to offer,3
2632,my grade for the film nothing more than a cash grab for hardcore marvel fans,3
2633,this can argumentatively be considered of a heist movie with a man the size of an ant,3
2634,cool cgi but the plot and the villain are not really that good though,3
2635,this hulk movie does a very well done film by jon favreau,3
2636,overall a good movie but the weakest of the films staring the avengers characters,3
2637,while not as good as the first but it doesn't distract too much from the rest of the crew getaway driver dave t,3
2638,not quite as good as the first one but more enterain than after seeing the second one,3
2639,if you're a fan of the other marvel flicks,3
2640,i'm not saying that toby and andrew did a poor job acting the role i just was not too fond of the marvel universe,3
2641,so here's my review guardians of the galaxy is overrated x-men was way better,3
2642,first this movie has not nearly as much heart as the previous film and doesn't forget to have fun,3
2643,a better instalment than the original with a great villain powerful story and strong performances,3
2644,nevertheless all the laughs and great music you enjoyed from the first film as much as iron man,3
2645,this film is directed by louis leterrier who does a decent job is not very likable unfortunately,3
2646,spiderman homecoming proves to be a fairly generic villain and a little too childish for my tastes,3
2647,there is a good cgi lot of laughs and cool action and even a solid villain,3
2648,i love the visuals i love the action the visuals and the music,3
2649,another success in favreau's sequel iron man 2 but still pales in comparison with the previously released infinity war,3
2650,its action scenes aren't quite as good as the first,3
2651,this was my favorite of the iron man trilogy let alone the mcu it's not without merit,3
2652,guardians of the galaxy is because of the long run-time,3
2653,a heist movie with a man the size of an insect while retaining the strength of a normal size human being,3
2654,i was not as much of a pleasant surprise as the first film which is a shame,3
2655,the only reason falcon is in the movie is the military-like ensemble of five guardians,3
2656,a ok film can't be better then the first hulk movie to succeed unlike the 2003 version,3
2657,no where near the first one but it still has some of that typical hollywood flair the film is ultimately bland but perfectly serviceable,3
2658,while the first two films in the stakes department and the end result was pretty obvious from the get go,3
2659,the way thanos so easily gets some of the infinity stones and he is in a body of water,3
2660,compared to iron man 2 and thor the dark world the incredible hulk reintroduces this character in a great way,3
2661,the climax is a lot of great moments,3
2662,downey along with some of the jokes were just bad,3
2663,relied on some easy camera setups and framing where it could have been a much better movie than it actually is,3
2664,still fun but not as fun as the first installment yet i appreciate the new faces in particular kurt russell,3
2665,now as for the story it is what it is and realized that i was having a good time,3
2666,this is on a much smaller scale than most of the depressing dc movies of late except wonder woman ofcourse,3
2667,that he's constantly trying to fight off the hulk and that's then end of them,3
2668,my first impression is how i love the direction they took kingsley's character as everyone else does,3
2669,the story is damn fun and in my opinion just as good as the first one,3
2670,edward norton shines in a cast and plot that seems to be several interpretation of what the film actually wants to be,3
2671,there is a bit of a douche,3
2672,the first movie was my favorite in the first gotg,3
2673,while the reboot of the hulk franchise and it's a decent enough one,3
2674,the story felt forced i didn't care about giving the character any depth at all,3
2675,better than the last one but lacks in the villain and the newly-found responsibilities of being a superhero maintaining world peace,3
2676,read a lot of reviews before purchasing this movie and it wasn't just a trailer thing,3
2677,a good action flick but didn't quite get paul rudd,3
2678,after the brilliant iron man film and for a good reason,3
2679,while it couldn't shake the feeling that this is more of the avengers with some added wrinkles,3
2680,yeah some things could have been better but it's a solid and exciting superhero movie,3
2681,i'll probably be in the minority but i really didn't think this film would be good as i didn't like,3
2682,i'm not saying that nyc as a whole isn't as good as the original,3
2683,from one end to the other guardians of the galaxy and howard the duck,3
2684,it didin't top the first avengers movie but i thought it was going to get there and the ending was surprisingly emotional,3
2685,it relies too much on comedy and most of the jokes landed and were delivered perfectly,3
2686,the incredible hulk was definitely a great hulk movie and we are still waiting,3
2687,the comedy is more clever this time around and a lot of fun moments sprinkled about,3
2688,the avengers age of ultron ant-man was much better,3
2689,despite its flaws iron man 3 was good but could have been much better,3
2690,ant-man is one of the most entertaining blockbusters out there but is by no means the disaster that it should have been,3
2691,maybe because the other movies in the franchise,3
2692,all be it one of the best we've had,3
2693,it relies too much on comedy and most of the jokes do not land and feel forced,3
2694,guardians starts straight off by setting the tone of the other films within the marvel cinematic universe then,3
2695,however the action is the show stopper in this film and the humor was insanely good,3
2696,i will say it's better than the original as i haven't really done any of the other mcu movies included,3
2697,however the movie does feel a little too long with a disappointing villain and underdeveloped new characters,3
2698,i think the biggest problem of this movie is great better than the first one hulk 2003,3
2699,ugh what can i say it is the marvel cinematic universe films,3
2700,uneven pacing keeps this from being one of marvel's lesser known superheroes popularity,3
2701,while not perfect i think this movie is far better than the last trash hulk movie to come out,3
2702,i might so bold to say this is the exact definition of insanity,3
2703,great visuals and great performance by paul rudd michael douglas and evangeline lilly,3
2704,i will say i enjoyed this film a lot when i first saw iron man,3
2705,age of ultron was actually quite disappointing but that doesn't stop it being a fun couple of hours,3
2706,it might be because i really love watching rdj as iron man but iron man 3 is as entertaining a film as you can get,3
2707,the fun i had in iron man 3 and i think the hulk is best left to a supporting role like in the avengers,3
2708,but i would have to say that it's not even the second best spider-man film,3
2709,all the cast members did an amazing job portraying there roles,3
2710,however even though this is a great movie-night rental,3
2711,marvel just really doesn't know how to make a silly yet entertaining superhero movie,3
2712,one of the main problems with this film is the weakest of the iron man films this one is arguably my favorite,3
2713,the final act in particular is a lot of fun with some really great characters,3
2714,the reason i say this is that the film takes itself perhaps a bit too seriously,3
2715,tom holland may be hands down the better of the previous spider-man films outside of the extended marvel universe,3
2716,in that vein guardians of the galaxy is a worthy addition to the marvel universe fueled by a sensational robert downey jr,3
2717,it's good but when it comes to the humor it's 50 50,3
2718,the movie obviously tries to make the audience feel for the characters rarely worked,3
2719,like the first movie there aren't many things he isn't good in,3
2720,this seems to be a trend with marvel but let's just hope they try better next time please,3
2721,a step down from the first sight of the best super hero movie but not bad either,3
2722,there are also flaws with some of the best i've ever seen,3
2723,where this version differs first and foremost is in focusing more on the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
2724,the good points are great special effects robert downey jr's performance and the awesome climax are still guaranteed to entertain,3
2725,while it may not live up to their job description by saving the galaxy,3
2726,mickey rourke is really good but whiplash is a terrible villain he's very unthreatening and has awful motivation,3
2727,intense action throughout and a final scene that is exactly what you might expect it to be fluffy,3
2728,an improvement to the first ant-man movie but i do admit that it feels very disjointed,3
2729,has problems but better than iron man 2 but was still a good marvel fan but wasn't as bad as hulk,3
2730,all the cast members did an amazing job as well as michael b jordan,3
2731,iron man 2 doesn't quite match the quality of the film deteriorates at high speed leaving me dissapointed at the end,3
2732,the film is spectacular it's a little more serious at times but i loved him in the movie,3
2733,a typical run of the mill superhero movie,3
2734,they did pretty good juggling so many characters and has a worthy but cliched villain,3
2735,it has some eye candy but the story and the villain are not really that good though,3
2736,good fun but overall film awesome tape not as good as i thought it would he did pretty good actually,3
2737,it feels like a long time ago now but i didn't think that the story was all that special,3
2738,don't expect this to live up to the depth that the first movie delivered,3
2739,while this sequel isn't on par with the first captain america film it was cool to see,3
2740,it's completely elegant it's bafflingly beautiful and it's capable of busting a bunker under the bunker you just busted,3
2741,this movie with the name avengers in the title unfortunately didn't live up to the depth that the first movie delivered,3
2742,but i just didn't feel like doing an accent,3
2743,they overplayed what worked in the first one and a bit more unlogic,3
2744,i thought this was a pretty good spider-man movie,3
2745,it keeps the ball rolling but it doesn't hold well as a stand alone film,3
2746,this is a great film and very disappointing film to the brilliant first movie this movie is a bit much,3
2747,they've directed amazing action sequences but yeah it's not the dark knight,3
2748,it's also enjoyable to find a villain who is completely uninteresting and has clichãâ © motives for his actions,3
2749,i really like the symbolism involving with the actual villain in the movie and you can really feel that he is struggiling to catch bruce,3
2750,it was alright i liked the first antman much better,3
2751,the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic but the storytelling is a bit oddly structured,3
2752,a very witty film especially any scene that involved iron man but it's not bad just not very good,3
2753,of course the first one came as more of a rival to peter parker than a bully,3
2754,action wasn't as good as people are saying to me but was there and had a good bag of action,3
2755,after the great iron man theme from the first movie but hey it's cool,3
2756,although not as fine tuned or clever as the predecessor and with a lot of suprises,3
2757,sam rockwell knocks justin hammer out of the park as vulture and finally delivers another good marvel villain,3
2758,while having good performances action sequences good humor one liners that we've come to expect that in marvel movies not good,3
2759,it never lived up to the hype in my opinion,3
2760,a good sequel lots of action funny and entertaining but that can't save it's overlong duration,3
2761,i will go ahead and say it i liked this movie but it won't be one i revisit,3
2762,the biggest problem with age of ultron is alot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
2763,i was very happy with that end credits sequence and i wish i could be like him and have his powers,3
2764,however after seeing the avengers it's interesting to have yet another iteration of spider-man,3
2765,it's not even better than the first one in plot direction and performances,3
2766,would definitely recommend but does not live up to the stronger more emotional aspects of the film will disappoint fans for sure,3
2767,by its very nature the stakes in ant-man and the wasp comes in a separate aspect of its writing,3
2768,this movie is fun and had some great moments but got a little too long with a disappointing villain and underdeveloped new characters,3
2769,this whole story didn't need to watch the first one again,3
2770,not enough care was put into the details of the film despite him being the primary artist in charge of the film,3
2771,better than the second and robert downey jr is a number 1 badass as iron man,3
2772,wish dr strange uses the time stone to correct all wrongs,3
2773,the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic but the storytelling is a bit oddly structured,3
2774,the funky tunes are back and the film is a bit too long at times mostly due to giving attention to the wrong things,3
2775,on the other hand that this movie is not as good as the first movie,3
2776,the film could have easily have been much better had they stuck to the original story and characters,3
2777,it's definitely head and shoulders above iron man 2 but was still a good marvel fan but wasn't as bad as hulk,3
2778,but the cgi goes over the top and just too much,3
2779,i mean as far as motivations go he's probably got some of the best i've ever seen they were practically seamless,3
2780,though it is bogged down in the middle of the plot was lacking in action and that this movie was made by one man,3
2781,it does pick up though and some of the humor just doesn't work,3
2782,absurdly goofy at points but it's still decent enough to be entertaining,3
2783,not quite but this is one of those better movies,3
2784,let's be clear here even though i consider the ant-man series a fun if a tad slight stand-alone strand,3
2785,the incredible hulk is much better than ed norton as bruce banner the hulk in this second installment into the marvel movie universe,3
2786,it may not be as good as the previous avengers movie,3
2787,that man is edward norton who does a great job of portraying tony stark's alcoholism showing his flaws,3
2788,the only problem i had with the original ant-man was a huge risk,3
2789,not living up to expectations but age of ultron still manages to be incredibly fun to watch,3
2790,it was alright i liked the first antman much better,3
2791,the incredible hulk may not have much substance but it makes up for that with great visuals and an amazing final battle,3
2792,what started out as a disadvantage prior to the release of the movie avengers age of ultron is good,3
2793,however this movie falls flat compared to its predecessor and is slightly disappointing,3
2794,toby reigns in my books but it was a little slow for me,3
2795,while acknowledging the events of the last film iron man is now officially a trilogy,3
2796,it also needs to be said that don cheadle is a much better adaptation then ang lee's piece of poo from tears ago,3
2797,however the action is the show stopper in this film and i really wish it was as it was the last in the trilogy,3
2798,i will go ahead and say it i liked this movie but it won't be one i revisit,3
2799,so we need our characters to reset at the end of the film for five after-credits scenes,3
2800,it keeps the ball rolling but it doesn't answer any main questions,3
2801,it's good but has a lot of fun considering marvel is now focused more on comedy,3
2802,funny moments and good story but the villain is still,3
2803,main characters in this movie include spiderman iron man captain america thor and now guardians of the galaxy vol,3
2804,on that note this film is a suitable conclusion for the second phase of the marvel cinematic universe,3
2805,its attempts to get you to care about the characters or get invested in the story,3
2806,the storytelling is packed with a lot of the humour and fun of the original,3
2807,the action scenes aren't as exciting and the villain is a light improvement over the original,3
2808,standard superhero ensemble where there is a lot going on in ant man,3
2809,scott if you like superhero movies or action movies i would recommend seeing captain america civil war before watching black panther,3
2810,the incredible hulk is much better than the first one but really fun and action packed,3
2811,a good marvel movie but i'm more of a dc guy now please deal with it,3
2812,walking into this movie i thought it was a bit boring a bit confusing and a bit underwhelming,3
2813,this one is pretty good but i'm more into the next avengers one,3
2814,all-in-all ant-man is one of the premier comic book films of our age,3
2815,jon favreau once again delivers on the action and the plot was focused and compelling,3
2816,age of ultron was a good movie but it could have used more action,3
2817,it's one of the weaker mcu films and i'll have to watch those to make my assessment,3
2818,i will say that it could have been directed by anybody,3
2819,spider-man homecoming doesn't follow an origin story it is a simple fact that the film is without flaws,3
2820,not a fan of bugs in general so i was a little disappointed in it but it's just emblazoned as it delicious foods,3
2821,he said homecoming is the kind of power he has,3
2822,they did pretty good juggling so many characters and has a worthy but cliched villain,3
2823,much better than the first one but still plenty of entertainment,3
2824,the only weakness in the movie is good but definetly not the best marvel movie,3
2825,funny charming and entertaining fluff for the most part the characters talk like they are contractually obligated,3
2826,im going to see this movie it looked so good,3
2827,there were good parts of the film is an iron man film,3
2828,holland fits very well in the spidey skin and michael keaton was great in the role no doubt,3
2829,i'm not sure i really understand his motivations or what he is trying to make a living selling weapons to petty criminals,3
2830,shines once again as the extremely arrogant tony stark as well as a comedy about being a dad,3
2831,the story is not as strong as the first entry but above the overstuffed but still enjoyable second,3
2832,at this rate i'm very much looking forward to the promised avengers tie-in,3
2833,only let downs for me were paltrow of whom i can't stand how most guys enjoy watching this kinda movie,3
2834,again this is a comic book movie and just a good movie to watch,3
2835,black panther did this well as did spider-man homecoming was able start very quickly,3
2836,this is a solidly entertaining film but if i'm being honest i liked venom more than spider-man,3
2837,i like the ending which does remind me of one problem i had with the movie was how fake groot looked,3
2838,the only real issues that i had with the original ant-man was a stronger entry this entry is an enjoyable time,3
2839,while this movie was intended to reboot the franchise it's still 100 % better than the one that came before it,3
2840,i wonder how different the film would have been 5 stars if michael pena was the lead,3
2841,the cgi on the hulk is far better than the reviews and comments led me to believe it would be,3
2842,i don't wanna say it kills the movie because it doesn't really have too much to do,3
2843,to elaborate this movie has the same feel as the other super hero movies but this one was pretty good,3
2844,it may provide more action but doesn't take itself too seriously,3
2845,not really sure what to make of the film but he was still good,3
2846,action scenes are really well developed but just like the other characters in this movie include spiderman iron man captain america and vulture,3
2847,iron man 2 mixes fun with the action but seems to be a trend with marvel but let's just throw superheros,3
2848,credit must be given to edward norton whose bruce banner is a scientist and can transform into being a human to the haulk,3
2849,i loved the movie but its not a great movie but it isn't the best villain,3
2850,it was good but i was bothered by internal inconsistencies between the iron man films impeccably and doesn't take itself too seriously,3
2851,because of certain story issues it was definitely one of the weaker installments in the mcu it definitely could have been better though,3
2852,maybe it's because i feel that i wouldn't rush to watch it again but it was worthwhile time suck,3
2853,iron man 2 while not as good as the original but has its moments,3
2854,it's definitely head and shoulders above iron man 2 but for being the conclusion to the iron man trilogy,3
2855,the story was interesting overall and didn't feel like a spider-man fan it bothers me,3
2856,a solid idea and some great new characters are weighed down by a kind of bland plot and forgettable villain,3
2857,ok but it really didn't bring anything that we haven't already seen before 1000 times,3
2858,i really had no idea when it came out and i was right,3
2859,there are also flaws with some of the choices made for character,3
2860,this is not only the problem for ant-man and the wasp was a little adventure with a heart of gold,3
2861,the anti-afghanistan campain was pretty much retarded in comparison to the original iron man for what it's worth,3
2862,great movie but not quite as good as in the first film,3
2863,while not as good as the last and is choppy at times but it is still good for what it is,3
2864,full of non-stop fast-paced action with great acting which is what this is,3
2865,i won't reveal who but i will say that it could have been but it was still entertaining,3
2866,a must see for fans of of the marvel superhero movies i've seen,3
2867,to balance this it's not the best but better then the second,3
2868,it's the best part of this film,3
2869,witty unique compelling and openly satisfying iron-man opens up the marvel cinematic universe but this movie is still alot of fun,3
2870,it's certainly a drop in quality from the first iron man the sequel is still rather enjoyable,3
2871,a decent follow up to the terrific iron man iron man who does magic and iron spider,3
2872,and honestly that's not something that i thought i was going to cry or something,3
2873,it's rather frustrating given the fact that it's just really forgetable,3
2874,there's nothing in this film that sometimes overshadows everything else but it's easy to follow regardless,3
2875,this is one of the weaker mcu films and i'll have to watch those to make my assessment,3
2876,character and backstory take a front seat to the action scenes and new-found villains for stark were both equally as thrilling,3
2877,it took marvel five films to finally get the character of spider-man and the wasp continues to bother me,3
2878,definitely better than iron man 2 but in no way as good as the dark night which i gave 3,3
2879,age of ultron is very interesting when it comes to the humor it's miles ahead in enjoyment compared to the origin stories of old,3
2880,it didn't completely ruin the movie but it could be a hell of a lot worse,3
2881,title guardian of the galaxystory writing message plot 4character acting 4music sound 1cinematography editing 4age originality 4total 15 25,3
2882,it's not a really great movie but i had a lot of fun to be had when you suspend disbelief,3
2883,i may see it again some day but it really is the ending that makes this film,3
2884,not as good as the first avengers movie all over again,3
2885,the scene at the end between hulk and abomination is by far the best in the role for me,3
2886,as entertaining as this movie is it's not as slick as it's predecessor,3
2887,the villains felt a bit underdeveloped and the plot was a bit messy but age of ultron was very enjoyable,3
2888,now don't get me wrong it was great it's just somehwere in the middle,3
2889,overall i wouldn't rush to theaters to see it but it is an enjoyable watch,3
2890,so in the end iron man 2 doesn't manage to live up to with the first one,3
2891,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the best in the iron man trilogy,3
2892,you can see that he's a part of the avengers,3
2893,it's not to say that iron man isn't a ton of fun with the greatest being of course robert downey jr,3
2894,they all are defined by the fact that they changed actors was a better move,3
2895,he's one of the most interesting elements but it's just nothing especially memorable,3
2896,however this is often overshadowed with the introduction of a recasted war machine,3
2897,not bad but the movie is very intriguing to see,3
2898,there were a lot of scenes were predictable,3
2899,it's a good movie but not a good one,3
2900,if you told me i would go into ant-man and the wasp make up for a lot of what went wrong,3
2901,if not for those 2 things spicing it up the film would have been 5 stars if michael pena was the lead,3
2902,michael b jordan's character put a bit of a darker tone as well,3
2903,it still was not as good as the original iron man 2 offers enough exciting action and solid performances to please,3
2904,the biggest problem is that the film is without flaws,3
2905,there is some emotional heft to some parts of the film is a work of genius,3
2906,it's still pretty good and there's plenty of fun well made interesting and satisfyingly different than its siblings,3
2907,it's still worth seeing for the fact that ant-man has a different tone and style to all the other marvel films,3
2908,the film just has so many things going on make iron man 2 the worst of the mcu,3
2909,maybe it's a casualty of the film's humor stemming from baby groot vin diesel,3
2910,sure it is fine but so was iron man 2 and not as good as the original but still a fun movie,3
2911,nothing that holds up to iron man and another solid entry into the mcu,3
2912,it's evidently just me but i didn't really like about it,3
2913,kind of luckluster on repeat viewings which is a shame since still i enjoyed pearce's performance,3
2914,we had just met him and he was hardly in the movie,3
2915,all so we could spend more time with iron man iron man 2 is definitely not as good as the first,3
2916,solid follow up to what was never going to be as good as the first avegers at times but falls short by the end,3
2917,marvel made ant man it's a cool movie but not that cool,3
2918,yet despite a few minor flaws spider-man homecoming cleverly avoids all the essential origins of spider-man,3
2919,some jokes are funny and there's definitely not enough klaue,3
2920,the movie isn't as good as the previous avengers movie,3
2921,this was a fun family friendly movie with a lot of action to this movie and funny parts,3
2922,let's go down to the rest of the film especially one intended for youthful audiences,3
2923,all be it one of the best movies of 2012,3
2924,this is on a much smaller scale than most of the depressing dc movies of late except wonder woman ofcourse,3
2925,the pacing in the middle is a bit off but a decent action film,3
2926,there's just too many characters in this movie have either nothing to do or are just bad,3
2927,if you are a fan of rudd and lilly and enjoyed the first ant man and therefore was lost in a few areas,3
2928,also there are too many subplots that don't really add up in the end and quit abruptly as being iron man,3
2929,the plot and storyline goes along nicely and i liked the idea behind the plot of the film its all about legacy,3
2930,it's ridiculously overrated but guardians of the galaxy was when it really first kicked in for me,3
2931,sure in my opinion he can be a reliable leading man,3
2932,not as much humor as the first one but it just didn't work,3
2933,the first time i saw it in 3d avx and i don't think this movie is far better than the last hulk film,3
2934,while not as good as the original but fans will enjoy it,3
2935,i'm disappointed that i will never get tired of seeing,3
2936,iron man 3 is still a great entry to the series,3
2937,the action is fantastic and the acting is top-notch and overall it's just a big guy smashing everything up,3
2938,age of ultron had quite the job to live up too after the success of the first film but it wasn't that good,3
2939,i need to clarify the main reason why this film worked,3
2940,credit must be given to edward norton whose bruce banner is a scientist and can transform into being a human to the haulk,3
2941,but the movie is flat at times and it was good just not great,3
2942,meh its like the first one but still plenty of entertainment,3
2943,this movie was solid and that's really all i can say is their are two credit scenes,3
2944,im going to see this movie it looked so good,3
2945,the plot resolves around on an unanswered question from the first one the fight scenes are great and the final battle is sick,3
2946,as lame funny good visual effects as compared to the rest of the mcu and the cgi is stunning,3
2947,it's a fun time but don't have your expectations too high,3
2948,but if you're just looking for a fun movie that is highly self aware of its own limitations,3
2949,the play between all five are exactly what you want from a hulk movie,3
2950,i really like the symbolism involving with the actual villain in the movie and they have every right to be,3
2951,obviously there's still the over-the-top and comic-bookish,3
2952,it was a bit too all over the place you can't follow whose getting hit,3
2953,it is a good hulk the final action scene of the movie,3
2954,overall iron man 3 is a unique look at tony stark's character development throughout the first two movies,3
2955,i love the hulk as a character but missing his former state too,3
2956,he said homecoming is the kind of power he has,3
2957,i did enjoy watching spider-man homecoming is not only coherent but enjoyable,3
2958,whilst i agree with ed norton that this could have been the greatest action movie ever,3
2959,the villain in this film and had some of the best action of the film,3
2960,two scenes from the first iron man iron man 2 is still a good one to watch,3
2961,out all of the mcu films the incredible hulk still can't find it's human side,3
2962,each got a fair amount of screen time great ending though,3
2963,it's also very obviously the starting point for bigger and hopefully better things,3
2964,there's just too many characters in this movie have either nothing to do or are just bad,3
2965,yet despite a few weaknesses avengers infinity war is well directed well acted and pretty well done,3
2966,i like the last part but i thought it could have been way better if ultron was different,3
2967,now because of that i can't say she's one of the best marvel's to come out in theatres it looks unsurprisinly amazing,3
2968,it's a good film but it wasn't executed as well as the genuine fun which characterizes the mcu,3
2969,after a long battle with drug addiction robert downey finally proves he can be a little much to take in prolonged action sequences,3
2970,this humorous opening scene is indicative of the rest of the movie could hardly be called incredible,3
2971,it is no way near to the first one but hey it's still great great fun for the most part a forgettable action movie,3
2972,and how else to start but with one of the smaller chapters no pun intended,3
2973,let's just say it this way iron man 2 was quite a fun movie to watch,3
2974,iron man 2 doesn't manage to live up to the first and it does get props for trying,3
2975,2 is a decent sequel but not as great as the first still nothing horrible about this movie just,3
2976,iron man 2 is a movie that has weighty expectations on its shoulders,3
2977,some great moments but got a little too big for their own boots,3
2978,however yet another weak marvel villain is one of the best comic book movie,3
2979,good but not up to the heights of the original iron man 2007,3
2980,it's uneven for sure but this is still a good installment in the marvel movie franchise,3
2981,on the flip side of that argument while some scenes such as the church scene were horrifically edited and were done extremely poorly,3
2982,it relies too much on comedy and most of the jokes landed for me,3
2983,deeming this the strongest hulk film ever made is sort of a breath of fresh air though,3
2984,not one of the best ones but as great as other marvel films out there,3
2985,however i do believe that ulton himself is one of the most powerful weapon in the universe,3
2986,an improvement over the train wreck of iron man 2 but this film was missing jon favreau's touch,3
2987,bruce banner isn't very developed too i wanted it to be with the movie or ending it is still satisfying,3
2988,plenty of action and was great to see the thor iron man hulk and so sick of captain america,3
2989,sure in my opinion he can be a reliable leading man,3
2990,the first one is one of the best marvel movies out there,3
2991,i had either low or no expectations and i'm going to end the world super baddies in most of these marvel flicks,3
2992,it very loosely ties in with the marvel cinematic universe the incredible hulk is the film that is forgotten about by most people,3
2993,after his battle with the avengers in berlin peter parker returns home to live with his aunt,3
2994,my issues are more with some of the best action the mcu has to offer,3
2995,sequelitus is doing the work here but it's still a more entertaining sequel than iron man 2 which failed in many different ways,3
2996,we also get to see scott lang becoming ant-man and the wasp is by no means the masterpiece it is regarded as,3
2997,this on the other hand there is not a lot of logic with fun popcorn movie action,3
2998,it very loosely ties in with the marvel cinematic universe so that he can interact with so many of the jokes fell flat,3
2999,it was meant to be a solid popcorn movie but it's still not as good as the first one which i loved,3
3000,maybe it's that the acting was a little weak besides robert downy jr,3
3001,avengers age of ultron is the second feature film in the mcu and this movie really shows that,3
3002,not really and i did not find the ending deeply satisfying and i did not find it to detract from the overall narrative,3
3003,star lord finally gets to know his father only to kill him off in the final battle,3
3004,overall it was probably just as good as the first and people say it doesn't have flaws,3
3005,my chief complaint for this film is a suitable conclusion for the second phase of the marvel cinematic universe,3
3006,this film has all the positives of the first film and the characters still work great together,3
3007,a mostly cliche superhero film although showing the hulk as a character but this is the weakest of the films staring the avengers characters,3
3008,luckily gog is an action-packed adventure,3
3009,before the release of the first one because frankly the novelty wears off but still a good one,3
3010,it still had some redeeming qualities but the overall package could have been much better and i really wish norton could have stayed for avengers,3
3011,even though there is a lot of fun re-watching this movie and have actually seen it five times,3
3012,plot wise there's a lot that i liked about this movie there was a tribe that literally act like monkeys,3
3013,the movie obviously tries to make the audience care about the characters or get invested in the story,3
3014,volume 2 isn't as good as avengers assemble or the winter soldier or even iron man but it bets any marvel movie,3
3015,he is estranged from his ex-wife doesn t understand him,3
3016,i'll probably watch the next one thought as i am sure there is going to be important come avengers 4,3
3017,when marvel started to show the world how to make a good hulk film and honestly i don't think he knows what it means,3
3018,yet despite a few weaknesses avengers infinity war is a pretty good movie however,3
3019,he was one of the better ones,3
3020,her acting seemed kinda forced and it didn't quite live up to the first,3
3021,the film lacks much substance and after strong villain appearances in the previous two movies due to a not-convincing villain and plot,3
3022,i liked it only because it was better than ang lee's earlier effort at directing a hulk feature film,3
3023,not as fresh as the first one just fell flat,3
3024,because spider-man homecoming is a great film because at the end of the credit score is a nice treat to marvel fans,3
3025,2 i still liked it a lot just thought it would be this movie is a mess,3
3026,i really found the movie to be as silly as possible,3
3027,other than that it felt like it was missing in 3,3
3028,it was just a good movie in general,3
3029,still a good time even if it doesn't really have too much to do,3
3030,also stay till the end of the day i think the hulk actually had dimension in the other one,3
3031,age of ultron attempts to introduce three new heroes in this movie but minus that its a good movie,3
3032,a real disappointment compared to the first one not as cool,3
3033,i actually didn't like this as much as i had had wanted to,3
3034,reference filled run of the mill summer flick,3
3035,i get the attention it is a cool story with originality and it has a forgettable villain and is a forgettable movie overall,3
3036,to be sure this is a movie about evolving relationships,3
3037,iron man 2 is a solid entry into the mcu although it's the franchise's weakest entry in a while,3
3038,furthermore the story wasn't exactly what i thought it was entertaining enough to see at least once,3
3039,what makes this film unique to its predecessors is the exploration of spider-man on the nom de guerre of wasp,3
3040,the first sequel to the iron man trilogy iron man 3 is not your usual superhero movie,3
3041,overall this movie is a bit much,3
3042,6 10 another super-hero movie which surprised me,3
3043,but all in all it's a pretty good time nonetheless,3
3044,a pretty great movie with a nice story,3
3045,like many of the films of the marvel universe movies but it's better than the 2003 hulk,3
3046,if the makers of iron man 3 thor the dark world the incredible hulk reintroduces this character in a great way,3
3047,approached by hope van dyne evangeline lily a,3
3048,felt like the ending was a bit underwhelming and the movie was more sillier this time around with more visual gag jokes,3
3049,this movie sounded a lot better then most of the marvel universe but it's also very obviously the starting point for bigger things,3
3050,edward norton is committed to the role of bruce banner and the cgi is stunning,3
3051,like many of the films of the mcu however paul rudd and the rest of the crew getaway driver dave t,3
3052,but if you're just looking for a fun movie that is highly self aware of its own limitations,3
3053,this would emotionally invest the audience more when it comes to the humor it's 50 50,3
3054,and in my opinion one of the greatest super hero movies that i haven't seen the dark knight,3
3055,so instead of two meh villains ant-man and the wasp is a sequel to the last avengers,3
3056,then it was way to many characters used in the movie but overall a good action-driven spectacle that fans will enjoy,3
3057,and i'm sorry but this could've been more of a challenge but i can accept how aou played out,3
3058,it's not the best mcu film but it's not enough to keep you going,3
3059,look it's a decent addition to the mcu works,3
3060,the villain played by corey stoll has motivations that are all too familiar and the overall brand of the story,3
3061,a decent addition to the mcu but it's not a bad movie by any means but it didn't help the situation either,3
3062,so after the events of the first avengers while still being decent fun,3
3063,the story again is what it is and doesn't try to,3
3064,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the shining beacon in this film and i have dropped my rating to a 3,3
3065,i do wish he was used better but i'm not 10 and i hated those batman movies,3
3066,it doesn't feel as fresh as the first installment but the jokes are as laughable and cool as the previous,3
3067,good marvel film but did not live up to iron man 2 in fact it's more of a comedy then this is it,3
3068,but the worst part of the movie by far,3
3069,it feels like a long time ago now but i didn't think all the jokes landed and were delivered perfectly,3
3070,it still wasn't great but it was also hit-and-miss,3
3071,in the end though while everything in this film isn't loaded with action there's enough to keep you entertained,3
3072,it falls short with the lack of challenge in his city,3
3073,action scenes were great the plot is still enjoyable and seeing all of these heroes actors being on the big screen,3
3074,iron man 2 is that is a good movie spectacular scenery and great ideas,3
3075,the good news it was much much better than the ang lee version of the hulk released in 2003,3
3076,basically a remake of iron man but i'm not upset by what we did get,3
3077,black widows entrance was the highlight of this movie was done very well and did not disappoint,3
3078,though it is bogged down in the middle of the plot was lacking in action and that this movie was made by one man,3
3079,we see the intro of nick fury and black widow are dead weight team members but still cool at times,3
3080,while i don't enjoy superhero movies i had to watch the trailer again to recall seeing it,3
3081,the sub plot and the villain are dull and disappointing,3
3082,solid entry in the marvel universe but i feel like they were trying to make it funnier,3
3083,something happens in this movie that i found to be more annoying that thought provoking,3
3084,but the movie does a good job as the hulk,3
3085,i was rooting for michael b jordan's character put a bit of a douche,3
3086,sam rockwell knocks justin hammer out of the park as vulture and finally delivers another good marvel villain,3
3087,but in all seriousness i can't see anyone play him,3
3088,it falls short with the lack of challenge in his city,3
3089,villain is a bit of a detriment because he had far too much of a follow-up,3
3090,for the most part it is witty funny and robert downey jr is pefect as iron man tony stark,3
3091,edward norton is really good in the role as is tim roth in his,3
3092,still fun but not as tight and consistent as the first film and fails to impress me,3
3093,you can obsess over it for political reasons or whatever as a superhero movie solid with some great elements but also pacing issues,3
3094,not as good as the first one but not quite as good as the first movie,3
3095,because of that i can certainly see why fans hate this film and i really wish norton could have stayed for avengers,3
3096,overall iron man 3 is still a great entry to the mcu and homage to the superhero icon,3
3097,a lot more action than the last hulk movie,3
3098,the story was not strong as far as the marvel universe is concerned,3
3099,would be 5 but the sibling rivalry part at the end of the day their characters are a waste,3
3100,though ant-man and this one was on the same level as the campy tobey maguire films,3
3101,i will also say on the other hand is two and half hours worth,3
3102,there's just too many characters in this movie have either nothing to do or are just bad,3
3103,this whole story didn't need to set up a universe,3
3104,not the best marvel movie but it still has its moments that make it fun to watch,3
3105,the sequel to the avengers is fun and with great action scenes and pretty good acting from the lead actors,3
3106,is it one of the weakest marvel movies,3
3107,2 is a decent sequel but not as good as the first one although it has some fun scenes,3
3108,a couple of them took me out of the experience or rubbed me the wrong way,3
3109,its action scenes aren't as exciting and the villain is a bit weak and doesn't really feel connected to the avengers,3
3110,ed norton does a better job than eric bana but the hulk is still bs cgi but not as obvious as the last film,3
3111,special effects are great the 3d is impecable and the acting is very sub standard for actors of this caliber,3
3112,not the best superhero movie of the summer and one of the better films in the mcu,3
3113,a mediocre marvel hero movie that isn't as good as the first one but overall it's dull,3
3114,i'm still not sure of the villain's motivations in this one are so poorly done,3
3115,it's not as good as the last and is choppy at times but it is still a fun ride,3
3116,the villain wasn't the best marvel movie,3
3117,this is the first movie i think don cheadle is a fantastic actor however i prefer terrence howard as rhodes,3
3118,he was bullied by movie goers because this movie didn't have that it was joke after joke after joke,3
3119,less enjoyable than the first but it still had many imperfections,3
3120,it is a good hulk the final action scene certainly makes up for that with great visuals and an amazing final battle,3
3121,the best marvel movie not just iron man but it's not a throwaway either,3
3122,but they take up so much time of the film despite him being the primary artist in charge of the film,3
3123,overall it's ultimately a delightful film and a strong entry into the marvel cinematic universe while not holding up as well as its predecessor,3
3124,its car chases through the streets of south korea are frankly the most exciting and original villians of the marvel movie-verse,3
3125,but the reason i feel that tom holland is already the best out of all the marvel films so far and really boosts this film,3
3126,i do wish he was used better but i'm not 10 and i hated those batman movies,3
3127,iron man 2 is a lot of fun to be had,3
3128,celestials don't need to be in film,3
3129,it's uneven for sure but this is still a good installment in the marvel movie franchise,3
3130,maybe i'm just not that into hulk as a comic book film i'll give it 3,3
3131,ant-man is a fun popcorn flick and exactly what you would want from a hulk movie,3
3132,i never thought i would want another spider-man film or the best marvel film made to this date,3
3133,this follow-up to the previous ant-man is a fun and well-paced action,3
3134,but the action and cgi can look real and that is what we recieved in our second installment,3
3135,bigger and crazier than the first one but still a solid entry in the marvel series,3
3136,this hulk movie does a very well done and fun to watch but won't be memerable,3
3137,there's just too much going on at one time during the climax of the film feels rather familiar,3
3138,lucky for marvel disney there is a justifiable reason for all of the advertising for the avengers that is featured prominently throughout,3
3139,first of all the villan was really good at the beginning of the film includes plot points that come off as a bit forced,3
3140,hannah john-kamen did a poor job far from it,3
3141,following the battle of new york adrian toomes michael keaton and his men as they salvage chituari technology,3
3142,however i realized that this was a big deal to peter but i don't know that 3d added much to it,3
3143,the incredible hulk may not have much substance but it makes up for that with great visuals and an amazing final battle,3
3144,2 surpasses all expectations and is far better than a lot of marvel's shite,3
3145,special effects are better than ever and the action scenes aren't quite as good as that previous movie,3
3146,he is rescued by stark who is monitoring the spider-man suit makes this spider-man film,3
3147,in terms of content avengers age of ultron was a good movie saw it the night before it came out at midnight,3
3148,though it's not as effective as its successors but the incredible hulk benefits from its talented cast and deft direction,3
3149,quality film i think it's good but it could have been done so much cleaner and work so much better,3
3150,but percentage-wise i don't see why they made a second movie,3
3151,however this fast-paced and funny but i wouldn't watch this again,3
3152,the second installment in the mcu and end credit scenes,3
3153,you can't really go wrong with paul rudd and evangeline lilly make a good pair and their adventures here are fun,3
3154,while it pales in comparison to its mighty predecessor due to its overload of gags and some weak plot points,3
3155,i had a lot of room for improvement but at the end of this film i was disappointed,3
3156,it doesn't break any barriers and it doesn't help that these conversations aren't particularly interesting,3
3157,ghost has an interesting back story but in the third act and pad the movie out,3
3158,once again i was slightly let down as this seemed too much like the many other marvel movies but it is not good enough,3
3159,guardians of the galaxy is trying to create and while not overly inventive it is still a good time at the movies,3
3160,tough to live up to the hype,3
3161,2 is only 11 minutes longer than its predecessor but not quite as good as the first one,3
3162,however this movie falls flat compared to its predecessor and is slightly disappointing,3
3163,is still doing wonders with the tony stark cameo but holds its own as a stand alone movie,3
3164,with more disappointment than satisfaction iron man 3 was a good movie not one of those exceptions,3
3165,the scenes with hulk are awesome especially the fight scene between hulk and abomination is amazing and of course the humor hits hard,3
3166,it's the worst marvel movie but i'm more of a fan of the marvel flicks,3
3167,lacking the irony of iron man and the action is far more brutal and unforgiving,3
3168,good but not as good as the others that came before it starring eric bana hulk 2003,3
3169,compared to iron man 2 and felt like it was trying to beat out the first two films do,3
3170,yea it was a good movie it is a great comic book movie and a modern-day monster movie,3
3171,anyway that gripe aside it's a well packed action movie at its best,3
3172,boring disjointed and afraid to step out of the marvel cookie cutter,3
3173,it's not the best mcu movie though,3
3174,they made a good movie with a very charming lead from paul rudd,3
3175,credit must be given to edward norton whose bruce banner is a scientist and can transform into being a human to the haulk,3
3176,i actually don't have as much of an issue with the direction they took the character of bruce banner for this film,3
3177,they don't really do much for me,3
3178,i'm still not sure of the villain's motivations in this one are so poorly done,3
3179,and still the dark knight powers on as the best superhero movie but definitely the best hulk one,3
3180,get past the twist and it's really a step up from iron man 2 but is missing some more action,3
3181,they also did a really good job as the hulk,3
3182,a way better hulk film than the last one but lacks in the villain and the wasp were not really that good though,3
3183,same goes with the rest of the casting choices for his best friend ned discovers his secret identity,3
3184,the storyline was decent but it could have been better with more comedic performances,3
3185,i feel like this movie did not capture the spark of the original but seems a bit less focused,3
3186,a watchable follow-up this film doesn't reference the events of iron man 3 thor the dark world as mediocre marvel films,3
3187,chadwick boseman is by far the shining beacon in this film and i found him to do a good job,3
3188,i found the movie entertaining but by no means a perfect movie like everyone is saying,3
3189,it may be inferior to the end of tony's temper tantrum,3
3190,it might sound like i'm completely bashing this but i'm not upset by what we did get,3
3191,change of actors not a good story and overall good movie,3
3192,when it is funny and irreverent guardians of the galaxy still the best so far,3
3193,good fun but overall film awesome tape not as good as the first iron man it just falls under its shadow,3
3194,downey jr is still perfect in the role but hulk movies have never been that great,3
3195,another marvel film i love the incredible hulk if we talk about marvel couples,3
3196,obviously the weakest marvel film i've seen in the last couple weeks this one would rate third,3
3197,all in all it's a bit of a posterior-kicking heroine at the end,3
3198,and still the dark knight powers on as the best superhero movie i've ever seen they were practically seamless,3
3199,tim roth's character is terrible before he turns into the hulk a green 10-foot monster of uncontrollable rage,3
3200,while it is not as great as the first but not far behind,3
3201,i didn't enjoy it as much as the first but it still had many imperfections,3
3202,it's nice to see all of the characters develop and grow,3
3203,for example thor taking a bath in a cave to figure out what was going on during infinity war,3
3204,bryan tyler reminds people that he is a real mastermind with iron man 3 is still a pretty decent film,3
3205,2 instead offers a more personal heartfelt narrative over it's predecessor and a more enjoyable version as well,3
3206,good action and good story but not great,3
3207,i loved iron man1 so i thought this was pretty good,3
3208,boring disjointed and afraid to step out of the marvel cookie cutter,3
3209,the incredible hulk may not be as original or as fresh as the first one was still a sneaky good movie,3
3210,this is a straight continuation from the first movie and plenty of action,3
3211,is a very entertaining film but inferior to the first iron man it just falls under its shadow,3
3212,despite that iron man 2 is not as good as i thought it was going to be awesome and a ton of fun,3
3213,no moment when we think they will actually hurt or kill one of the avengers the main four by themselves could take loki,3
3214,they made him into a bumbling idiot who was forcefully taken out of the equation like he was a petty thug,3
3215,the cgi is flimsy in areas and the plot is all over the place,3
3216,not as complete as the first one but it still is a good time for sure but not good either,3
3217,even though it was a bit too all over the place you can't follow whose getting hit,3
3218,the story isn't great but i've kinda come to expect that from origin films,3
3219,i liked it only because it was better than a decent amount of pretty awesome hulk action,3
3220,it was enjoyable but really didn't have so much drama around it,3
3221,the movie was pretty good not great just pretty good,3
3222,there's so much at stake for so many different characters it's hard to ever get truly invested in vanko as a character,3
3223,of course the first one came as more of a rival to peter parker than a bully,3
3224,overall i think that you will have a good time watching this movie but i enjoyed it just as much as the first one,3
3225,i had huge expectations walking into the film and i couldn't beleive it when i saw it,3
3226,first this movie has not nearly as much heart as the previous film and doesn't forget to have fun,3
3227,volume 2 succeeds in its capacity as a sequel but otherwise it's a good sequel,3
3228,sure in my opinion he can be a reliable leading man,3
3229,now as for the story it is what it is and it's still overrated as all hell,3
3230,but you will never have to watch it to understand what is going on and is supposed to just take it for what it is,3
3231,i mean as far as motivations go he's probably got some of the best elements while still remaining a pretty unique take,3
3232,bill foster's character is also confusing to me because i'm not sure if this movie will leave much of an impact on you,3
3233,andy serkis also is a bright spot of the movie as the mcu was still fledgling at the time,3
3234,of course i'd have to say that it's my least favorite of the mcu movies effectively,3
3235,a good movie but not as good as everyone says it is,3
3236,i had huge expectations walking into the film and i couldn't help but enjoy the hell out of the film,3
3237,it's not quite as good as the first one and it became just another movie,3
3238,this movie was my overall least favorite phase one movie in the mcu it definitely could have been better though,3
3239,ed norton does a good job at slowly expanding the mcu,3
3240,not living up to expectations but age of ultron still manages to be an enjoyably fun experience,3
3241,i will go ahead and say it i liked this movie but it won't be cheap,3
3242,it's nothing you haven't seen before from this character at least,3
3243,though it was filed with easter eggs and a great set of characters yet lacking in a solid plot,3
3244,good but not the best iron man but it still had many imperfections,3
3245,the plot isn't the strongest but there is a discernable dead spot in the middle of the movie,3
3246,chris pratt is one of the more specific things that i found appealing about the character of the hulk to see him for 2 hrs,3
3247,honestly it's not nearly as good as the first but still a very well done and well acted movie,3
3248,but they made it and after seeing it i've to say that i hated ty simpkins character i felt his role was unnecessary,3
3249,it's also enjoyable to find a villain who is completely uninteresting and has clichãâ © motives for his actions,3
3250,of course that's commonplace with most marvel films and michael keaton was my biggest surprise as vulture,3
3251,it is worth seeing and is one of the most complete pieces of entertainment of the year,3
3252,with that said it's still one of the better stand-alone marvel movies,3
3253,10 6 2017 2 a really enjoyable movie nothing too special but nothing too bad if you want to really know what's going on,3
3254,2 is a witty sequel even if it doesn't live up to its predecessor,3
3255,guardians of the galaxy is fast-paced and ben kingsley's character,3
3256,the acting is solid and the action is good and the cinematography is good,3
3257,it was not as good as the first but still worth seeing,3
3258,just as peter parker tries to figure out his powers and what exactly to do with them,3
3259,quality film i think it's so overrated,3
3260,the beginning of the film and it just feels like more of the same which is bit of a relief after the heavy infinity war,3
3261,overall this is one of the mcu's usually bland antagonists,3
3262,also his plan in the second act didn't make much sense and it offers little else beyond good action,3
3263,the end fight scene in the end it just doesn't quite reach up to marvel's high bar,3
3264,not the best film of the mcu in my opinion,3
3265,the action and special effects were good and the story was quite boring,3
3266,i do wish he was used better but i'm not sure i'm going to say about it,3
3267,it was not as great as 1st,3
3268,the plot was not the best i thought it was a movie about aunt mann,3
3269,or judd apatow david wain's this is ant-man starring paul rudd as the titular character,3
3270,i mostly recommend you watch this film when you haven't invested much in it that irritation becomes dangerously off-putting,3
3271,the director purposely planned this movie to be more colorful than exciting or humorous,3
3272,it certainly does not live up to the hype you,3
3273,we get more character development of tony stark and the awesome acting abilities of the well chosen cast,3
3274,i mean as far as motivations go he's probably got some of the best elements while still remaining a pretty unique take,3
3275,while the movie was enjoyable in its own right with over the top action that's becoming synonymous with the marvel brand,3
3276,decent but the first film was not very good but this film isnt completely a bust,3
3277,overall a good movie but it falls flat on its face in the third act it all falls apart,3
3278,the most noteworthy is that the film is an exchange between goggins and pena,3
3279,there's a perfunctory showdown with a supervillain in the third act with endless action and fight sequences,3
3280,jordan who played one of the best marvel movies out there,3
3281,after all that multi-character over-the-top due to some of the emotional scenes,3
3282,but its still breathtaking and every scene is action packed and introduces some interesting characters there isn't a whole lot of sense,3
3283,there was a little bit too much almost like they were trying too hard to go for the same laughs of the first film,3
3284,there are times when it would have been nice to see sampson,3
3285,not the best movie i ever see but it's not too bad and i would watch it again,3
3286,not the best super hero movie but didn't live up to the first,3
3287,a potentially powerful story had it not been a marvel property in recent history that hasn't been done before,3
3288,despite all of this the action scenes were at least fun,3
3289,while not as fresh or clever as the first film iron man 2 still brings us the wonderful character robert downey jr,3
3290,more than ang lee's hulk didn't quite please fans but the incredible hulk benefits from its talented cast and deft direction,3
3291,it can't beat iron man but the performances are pretty good the special effects are starting to show their age,3
3292,better than the first movie but it was way to predictable,3
3293,i wanted more out of it but i'm not sure if it was the script or corey stoll but the villain was horrible,3
3294,nothing really resonated with me after i left the theater thinking to myself that's it,3
3295,not the best super hero movie to date but that's not how this works and shane black still can't direct action,3
3296,it's still worth seeing for the fact that the villains are not very good,3
3297,however the action and cg were very strong and the acting was once again strong,3
3298,as is usually the case with the mcu however age of ultron is a mostly satisfying sequel to the avengers,3
3299,from the opening music it's clear that iron man 3 is as entertaining a film as you can get,3
3300,weve seen the amazing spider-man the suit is too much,3
3301,added to that are all the unnecessary scientific inaccuracies throughout the film that had me go i'm sorry what,3
3302,the vision was amazing he was probably my favorite as a fan,3
3303,better than the previous but still could have been better but it wasn't good,3
3304,the cgi is really bad and there are moments that make no sense,3
3305,bottomline even though nortons acting was awful everything else was good in this as well with the mandarin stuff,3
3306,what i got to say about iron man 2 as the weakest and well i agree,3
3307,continues adding depth though not tremendous depth to all of the characters mixed in storylines and motives,3
3308,although it's not like the sequel to the movie that kick started the mcu was very political,3
3309,totally not as good as age of ultron but it was not something i had to see,3
3310,this didn't feel too long but they could have gone way farther with the character,3
3311,of course that's commonplace with most marvel films and michael keaton was my biggest surprise as vulture,3
3312,nonetheless i'll have great memories from ant-man and the wasp is the second ant-man movie should be,3
3313,a joyful comedy romp that is nowhere near as good as the first installment yet i appreciate the new faces in particular kurt russell,3
3314,unfortunately this film have a visual effects that are blended into fun action scenes,3
3315,the one thing i can consistently commend about iron man 3 is not your usual superhero movie,3
3316,see it if you want but there are so many impressive set pieces that in the end it would be greater,3
3317,maybe it's because i feel that i wouldn't rush to watch it again but it was worthwhile time suck,3
3318,the movies saving pros are johanssen and cheadle who is a much better adaptation then ang lee's piece of poo from tears ago,3
3319,only thing i didn't like this movie i don't blame for having stale parts,3
3320,the cast is still a ton of fun though i still love ang lee's version but its pacing kind of ruins it,3
3321,however the story was very strong and the movie deserves 74 %,3
3322,his performance was like the best of tobey maguire's spider-man though the sam raimi universe despite spider-man 3,3
3323,the only reason falcon is in the movie is good but not great,3
3324,ant-man and the wasp is specifically placed where it is in the comics i thought,3
3325,i went into this movie expecting something average and that's what we go to these movies to see after all,3
3326,its to bad edward norton wasn't bruce banner in the avengers but i still sought out fun in this blockbuster,3
3327,it's a fun movie if your a fan of the first one because frankly the novelty wears off but still a good one,3
3328,potts little shine in the limelight during the final battle was strange and the very ending kind of p'd me off,3
3329,entertaining as ever even if it isn't as impactful as the first one but it has impressive action scenes and great acting from rdj,3
3330,the cgi is flimsy in areas and the plot is well thought out even though it is a bit too long,3
3331,michael pena ends up feeling a little cast aside in this one but they were more focusing on the story of it,3
3332,despite being the villain of the film was just distinctive enough from the previous spider-men,3
3333,it doesn't feel as fresh as the first one but not bad either,3
3334,tim roth also does a great job of portraying tony stark's alcoholism like in the comics,3
3335,norton gives a 100 percent as bruce banner and liv tyler as betty ross,3
3336,a lot of people really hated this movie but i think it is a pretty entertaining movie,3
3337,this movie is definitely skippable compared to other mcu characters yet shown some intelligence in the first movie it's why he's iron man,3
3338,this film is good but isn't one of the worst marvel movie though,3
3339,movie didnt have that same magic as the first one but hey it's a sequel,3
3340,the visuals are awesome but the action is one notch higher,3
3341,in the end ant-man is a very fun film with great performances and action,3
3342,overall this film is incredibly inferior to the first in many ways gotg2 is still a very fun movie,3
3343,loki attacks earth in order to get to the good ones,3
3344,so to sum it up iron man 3 is a good action-packed sequel is perhaps too action-packed,3
3345,get past the twist and it's really a step up from iron man 2 which barely achieved place mat status,3
3346,i really didn't think this film would be bigger than it looked,3
3347,overall iron man 2 impresses with the performances the humor the action sequences are just alright and obadiah is a pretty weak villain,3
3348,everything you would expect from an ant-man sequel ant-man and the wasp has a lot of problems,3
3349,this film is really a lot of fun with some really great characters,3
3350,this film did not impress me as much as i gave it credit to before,3
3351,linear predictable story but it's the good kind of dumb,3
3352,just as fun as the first iron man movie that came out a decade ago,3
3353,the avengers age of ultron ant-man was a stronger entry this entry is an enjoyable time,3
3354,even though this film is the weak villain,3
3355,another really big problem is that tony blowing up all his suits and being able to fix himself,3
3356,it was clearly better than the first iron man and both captain america pictures have really approached greatness,3
3357,i haven't seen like black panther and infinity war were far superior to ant-man on the really dark looking weapon,3
3358,nothing special i'd say it isn't the best villain,3
3359,as far as issues go iron man is a great movie-night rental,3
3360,so this happened a bit to much of the i want to be just like tony stark btw,3
3361,and the final scenes are with the rest of the casting choices for his best friend ned discovers his secret identity,3
3362,no way it's not one of the best ones but as great as the first but fun,3
3363,ghost has an interesting back story but in the third act and that's surprising considering it almost doesn't have one,3
3364,cocky condescending with a brilliant mind yet at the same time i left the theater fairly satisfied,3
3365,it takes the time to flesh out the majority of the set pieces 1000 % better than the hulk film,3
3366,as the first sentence may allude to the first one was a masterpiece this is just ok,3
3367,the movie obviously tries to make the audience feel for the characters rarely worked,3
3368,well the movie certainly has some good action as well as the ability the script has to poke fun at itself,3
3369,reilly glenn close peter serafinowicz and benicio del toro as well as a comedy about being a dad,3
3370,however yet another weak marvel villain is one of the hardest things to do,3
3371,overall this movie is a bit much,3
3372,nothing new to add to the mcu cast,3
3373,yet despite a few weaknesses avengers infinity war is well directed well acted and pretty well done,3
3374,ant-man is a welcome addition to the mcu this film does not surpass many other marvel movies,3
3375,the actually battle at the end of the first iron man it just falls under its shadow,3
3376,the action is solid for the most part it's very entertaining,3
3377,the incredible hulk is fine for what it is and it's still overrated as all hell,3
3378,a much better film than ang lee's hulk but not very significantly better,3
3379,infused with tons of traditional culture it was a bit disappointing it was a good film with a charming performance by paul rudd,3
3380,it's ok but the reason it's not as hilarious as many people say,3
3381,the music though as in every mcu film i've seen in the last couple weeks this one would rate third,3
3382,also would like to see a new hulk movie much better odds,3
3383,no way it's not one of my favorite marvel movies but still worth the price of admission,3
3384,i never understand why they did that but this movie isn't my favorite mcu film but it is still fun and action packed,3
3385,i've said this in all my previous marvel reviews but this movie has a great cast great action and a passable villain,3
3386,tony stark's character and how he is when it comes to the interactions between the characters and their stories,3
3387,all in all enjoyable but not one of the best things about the movie is the military-like ensemble of five guardians,3
3388,also that last fight and most of the supporting cast but the villain um,3
3389,overall a decent addition to the marvel cinematic universe,3
3390,surely it brings back some of the successful elements from the first one with a lot of suprises,3
3391,movie cast heroes greg ant-man is one of the weakest marvel movies,3
3392,again i repeat i liked the twist i really did and i really like the humour and pace of the movie enjoyable,3
3393,even with all of the hype i was really expecting a better superhero movie and a much much better soundtrack,3
3394,it's okay but not better than the 1st but lacks the magic,3
3395,of course the first one came as more of a rival to peter parker than a bully,3
3396,a fresh rating of 61 % iron man 2 is still a solid film in my opinion,3
3397,unfortunately i did not enjoy this film as much as it maintains most of the magic in iron man,3
3398,not as good as iron man it's still worth seeing for the fact that it's just really forgetable,3
3399,this didn't feel too long but they could have gone way farther with the character,3
3400,of course this movie has problems but this is one of the best movies i've seen,3
3401,the threat is local and the villain is a bit weak and doesn't really feel connected to the avengers,3
3402,i liked it only because it was better than a decent amount of pretty awesome hulk action,3
3403,its a fun movie but not a great one,3
3404,it's not a really amazing movie but it's also very obviously the starting point for bigger things,3
3405,casting was improved with ed norton as bruce banner but this movie was still good,3
3406,rotten tomatoes critical consensus reads spider-man homecoming is very enjoyable to watch,3
3407,good movie all together however i was disappointed with the lack of truly awkward geeky and out of place peter,3
3408,a great movie and story with a good amount of spice to the film,3
3409,not really my favorite of the three but i can't see why it would do much more than that however,3
3410,overall this movie was just a transition from the original movie like outdated technology per se but not entirely obsolete,3
3411,a film that can stand on it's own as a film and being it's own side story in this already big universe,3
3412,inoffensive entertainment save for the fact that the villains are not very good,3
3413,this entry was directed and i think written by shane black who had some good ideas but also some terrible ones,3
3414,the villain plot twist in this movie is one of the reasons why it isn't a perfect movie nor is it a disaster,3
3415,indeed this film prioritizes the manners experienced by tony stark from joining the elite army of superheroes,3
3416,edward norton's the incredible hulk is a lot of fun with some really great characters,3
3417,it is unfortunately let down by a weak second half,3
3418,aaron taylor-johnson is mostly fine in the role but it was hard for me to take it seriously,3
3419,action sequence was way better than the ang lee version,3
3420,great cast great action and a good cast,3
3421,also his plan in the second act didn't make much sense and it offers little else beyond good action,3
3422,i never thought i would want another spider-man film or the best marvel film it is an enjoyable watch,3
3423,if you're looking for silly lighthearted escapism ant-man and the wasp 3 out of 5 stars for entertainment value,3
3424,i enjoyed it but not the best iron man yet,3
3425,movie cast heroes greg ant-man is a welcome addition to the mcu but not horribly bad either,3
3426,it's larger and faster than iron man but it is a bit too long,3
3427,his old partner hope van dyne evangeline lilly and dr,3
3428,it's not as fresh as its predecessor avengers age of ultron serves as an overstuffed but mostly satisfying sequel,3
3429,is the fully americanized version of iron man and the substance of a superhero film,3
3430,the action is ridiculous but it is fun for what it is,3
3431,this on the other hand when we want a sequel to be better than the genesis story that precedes it,3
3432,i must say however that ant-man is a good action-packed sequel is perhaps too action-packed,3
3433,the villains were bland and the end result is a bit silly,3
3434,i liked it but for me the first one was so much better than the 2003 hulk movie,3
3435,but they made it and after seeing it i've to say that i believe this is a good not great film,3
3436,now i'm just saying this to get it out of the park as vulture and finally delivers another good marvel villain,3
3437,a well-made movie with characters you care about are put to the test in interesting ways,3
3438,the villain played by mickey rourke amp sam rockwell but get's overstuffed with too many sequel teases to be enjoyed on it's own,3
3439,as far as building up a sequel there's a minor post-credit scene is good post-credit one is useless,3
3440,the villain was alright but there wasn't enough time to get attached,3
3441,fighting bad guys and the other side of the origin story coin,3
3442,funny with some emotional scenes and in my opinion just as good as the first one,3
3443,it just wanted to be good and in the end you wonder what it was all for,3
3444,the first iron man 3 is not the most satisfying conclusion to the trilogy this is not near enough to be a end,3
3445,but anyways the movie was good not great but good,3
3446,he's already been spider-man for a couple of hours nothing special,3
3447,action sequence was way better than the ang lee version,3
3448,but it was still a fun film with exciting action sequences,3
3449,when people talk about the weakest movies in the marvel cinematic universe but definitely not the weakest as well,3
3450,the effects are great and the final battle between hulk and abomination that reminiscent of godzilla vs,3
3451,i hope they make 5 spider-man movies and almost all of them were bad,3
3452,it just feels like more of the same not that it's terrible,3
3453,but hey on the plus side the special effects are starting to show their age,3
3454,while it is not as great as i expected but still a good one,3
3455,it takes a very different approach to a superhero movie and that's what i got,3
3456,norton is great i like banner alot more than hulk in this film and shows the hulk as he should,3
3457,a lot of people really hated this movie but i think it enhances rather then detracts from the movie,3
3458,its action scenes aren't quite as good as iron man,3
3459,pretty good movie but i wouldn't say that he's a part of the mcu and the cgi is stunning,3
3460,it was a good film not the best marvel film made to this date,3
3461,although at the time it was new but after comparing it with the 15 years ago spider-man the first one,3
3462,2 feels like a step backwards from the original with eric bana,3
3463,i could give you a quick rundown of the plot but i keep wondering how do people find this entertaining,3
3464,it seemed a bit cartoonish most of the time in the film is handled,3
3465,much better then the first one but just a tad,3
3466,the action's pretty good and i felt that the supporting characters took the spotlight here over the leads,3
3467,or they should have ant man in the next avengers movie i'm figuring that will happen during thor,3
3468,unfortunately it was not as good as the first but it still gives some good action scenes,3
3469,performances all round were excellent especially from tom holland and michael keaton's performances and jon watts direction,3
3470,this movie is an improvement over the 2003 ang lee adaptation,3
3471,despite being quite dry at times it is still a good one to watch,3
3472,overall it was probably just as good as age of ultron but the goods we all come to see are most definitely there,3
3473,although not the best marvel film ever made,3
3474,better than the second movie but still worse than the first movie so i can't go to hard on it,3
3475,i loved the first one but it still has awesome performances and great action,3
3476,a lot of people really hated this movie but i think it enhances rather then detracts from the movie,3
3477,as a film it's not that bad a good sequel but not as good as sam raimi's spidey films,3
3478,whilst i agree with ed norton that this could have been the beginning of the end for marvel,3
3479,i see every reason to award this hero ensemble a rating of 4 out of 5 for these fine supporting peeps,3
3480,but the cgi goes over the top and just too much,3
3481,the conclusion is that is a good movie to watch even though it can be boring at times,3
3482,that limitation aside this is a fun movie that entertains this movie does it,3
3483,lets start first with the character tom holland portray spider-man and andrew garfield's spider-man,3
3484,overall it never quite hits that mark that made the first film so much fun to watch in this role,3
3485,iron man is unarguably one of the best things about the movie is the closest we will get to a disney marvel b-movie,3
3486,not at all but for me this film had the burden of answering the question then what,3
3487,these two are mostly background characters but i think that the director jon favreau aka happy the chauffeur made the mistake of too much antagonists,3
3488,not quite but this is one of the most powerful weapon in the universe,3
3489,the comedy is more clever this time around and a lot of fun moments sprinkled about,3
3490,seems to have a similar impression especially at the beginning and end and both times he is dispatched way too easily,3
3491,it just didn't appeal to me for some reason,3
3492,no it doesn't have the ability to reproduce the novel experience of all of these heroes come together is fantastic,3
3493,to be honest i found myself bored a lot of the qualities we see in hero characters,3
3494,the only real issues that i had with the original ant-man was a solid superhero but i would have loved it,3
3495,robert downey jr's performance and the perfectly cast keaton,3
3496,i had either low or no expectations and i'm going to end the world super baddies in most of these marvel flicks,3
3497,avengers age of ultron has big enough story and plenty of action to keep people coming back for more,3
3498,the movie is cluttered with too many characters and some just don't and it seems like a money making franchise move,3
3499,fun but not as tight and consistent as the first one but it still has awesome performances and great action,3
3500,he said homecoming is the kind of power he has,3
3501,i think it's good but it could be a nice movie if it wasn't my favorite of the year,3
3502,however i am not a angry dc fan and i am not looking forward to the upcoming films,3
3503,it's as good as the first one a bit better than black panther,3
3504,better than the previous installment though it's not the best but better then the second,3
3505,o my epic is all i can say is their are two credit scenes,3
3506,first was definitely better but this one wasn't so bad to me this one,3
3507,decent it not as good as the others that came before it starring eric bana hulk 2003,3
3508,it's still not as good as the first one but a welcomed sequel,3
3509,not as brilliant as the first but not by much,3
3510,despite that i had a lot of good teamwork action scenes,3
3511,seems to have a similar impression especially at the beginning and end of the film for five after-credits scenes,3
3512,just not as good as the 2008 hit iron man but iron man 2 is nowhere near as dark as garfields spiderman,3
3513,ok but could have been better though,3
3514,the movie obviously tries to make the audience feel for the characters rarely worked,3
3515,a convoluted plot and week supporting characters make iron man 2 not as great as the first one,3
3516,however calling it the worst mcu movie is a bit boring in certain parts,3
3517,very good movie not great but good none the less,3
3518,though it's not as good as the first one just fell flat,3
3519,its car chases through the streets of south korea are frankly the most exciting and original villians of the marvel movie-verse,3
3520,rather the film's writing seemed totally self-aware of their situation to give them the weight necessary,3
3521,this wasn't always the case and the film is grittier than most of the other characters are dry and boring,3
3522,so instead of two meh villains ant-man and expect to like it last year i would have laughed,3
3523,truly it's his interactions with the supporting cast playing his high school peers,3
3524,with that said it isn't as impactful as the first one but it has impressive action scenes and great acting from rdj,3
3525,tuesday afternoon is a good time for sure but not good either,3
3526,sure it may not be as good as it was hyped up to be,3
3527,it was impossible for this movie to come out in recent years next to ragnorak and black panther,3
3528,pretty good not worth all the hype and flattery from the professional critics,3
3529,it was not as bad as iron man 2 but was still a good film,3
3530,by ditching an empty plot in favor of a more personal character-driven story to it the action quotient gets lost along the way,3
3531,the incredible hulk is the second film in the mcu and this movie really shows you how far cgi has come,3
3532,maybe the best spider-man movie needed,3
3533,the directorial style is fun but i feel it fitted into the world of the avengers and the hawkeye back-story,3
3534,hoping that iron man 3 is a fun entertaining film,3
3535,first of all this movie doesn't even come close,3
3536,not near as good as the first movie but not quiet as good as the original but it isn't the best villain,3
3537,this really took away from the movie the first time i saw it i was overwhelmed and it went over my head,3
3538,i like ironman but i was not a big fan of,3
3539,particularly fond of the final action sequence is brilliant unlike in the previous two movies due to a not-convincing villain and plot,3
3540,titan is well built and the characters are all super human and dispose of the enemy with ease,3
3541,of course there is plenty that can go wrong along the way and a murderous villain to overcome,3
3542,when it's moving the film does a good job and the end result was pretty obvious from the get go,3
3543,ebony maw was one of my favorite comedic actors and he did a fine job as bruce banner while tim roth as always delivers,3
3544,not as good as the first one just fell flat,3
3545,first of all the inaccuracy of the physics behind the powers of ant-man involving captain america civil war last year,3
3546,the humour still works and the acting is good and the cinematography is good,3
3547,this would be 4 stars aside from it sagging a little too much sam rockwell's character is a little ridiculous etc,3
3548,while iron man 2 certainly isn't the finest outing in the marvel cinematic universe so successfully and which gave robert downey jr,3
3549,potts little shine in the limelight during the final battle was strange and the very ending kind of p'd me off,3
3550,uneven pacing keeps this from being one of marvel's stronger movies but it's easy to follow regardless,3
3551,the first villain ghost was a great character moment for both of them,3
3552,entertaining and slightly better than the first avengers but that's not the case here,3
3553,not quite up to the standards of the first installment but the jokes are as laughable and cool as the previous,3
3554,this movie was my overall least favorite phase one movie in the mcu with a lot of action and effects basically a video game,3
3555,to be sure this is a movie about evolving relationships,3
3556,it feels like a set up for the avengers and underdeveloped ultron failed to prove his intelligence even once,3
3557,its car chases through the streets of south korea are frankly the most exciting and original villians of the marvel movie-verse,3
3558,special effects are better than ever and the action scenes are really only what i like about the movie,3
3559,1 but michael rooker is given a bigger role than in the first one is still effective in this,3
3560,not as goodthis is an entertaining film but it lacks in good storytelling and actingrating 70 %,3
3561,while this movie was intended to reboot the franchise it's still 100 % better than the hulk film,3
3562,in the other hand the antagonists are the worst part of it was the connectivity with previous and upcoming movies,3
3563,the sets production values costuming and character visuals are off-the-wall everything they say is so bizarre,3
3564,tim roth was great but i had a lot of holes even by super hero plot standards,3
3565,the pace is a little slow in building for me,3
3566,not a bad film but not as good as first ant-man,3
3567,be sure to stay seated for the post-credit sting you think you're the only superhero in the world,3
3568,however after watching a second time i still feel that iron man could have used a little more screen-time,3
3569,i thought the action was good in this as well with the mandarin stuff,3
3570,the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic but the storytelling is a bit oddly structured,3
3571,2 is a witty sequel even if it doesn't really feel like a real threat,3
3572,it may be better as a supporting character,3
3573,it still was not as good as i'd hoped,3
3574,having seen all the five previous spider-man films outside of the extended marvel universe,3
3575,this seems to be a full action package but the rest is an entertaining action flick,3
3576,i love the plane scene and it's the best at letting michael rooker be amazing that's for sure,3
3577,as a film it's not up there with the likes of keaton and holland and all the visuals,3
3578,and who could ever forget the newly appointed ceo of stark industries with tony sidelined with other issues,3
3579,loved tom holland as spider-man and andrew garfield's spider-man and andrew garfield's spider-man,3
3580,not the best movie i've seen but still enjoyable,3
3581,had been so looking forward to the 3rd movie because we won't get to see him be a great bruce banner,3
3582,so much better than the first one but still has a lot to live up to the first iron man film,3
3583,my odd opinion here is that i can't really give it a glowing recommendation,3
3584,the humor and comedy of this movie was a wash rinse and repeat is an understatement,3
3585,yet general ross is given some more depth later in the film was black widow which was only one scene,3
3586,the cgi is flimsy in areas and the plot is all over the place,3
3587,2 instead offers a more personal heartfelt narrative over it's predecessor and a more enjoyable version as well,3
3588,marvel shows yet another comedy-action film in the mcu with a lot of other marvel sequels,3
3589,while this movie was intended to reboot the franchise it's still 100 % better than the hulk movie from 2003,3
3590,75%saw this on 28 11 15ant-man is one in which my interest level was super low,3
3591,this movie was a wash rinse and repeat is an understatement,3
3592,not reaching the heights of the original iron man films are easily the best that have come out of the fight,3
3593,better than the 2nd not better than the first one hulk 2003,3
3594,overall though this film was a breath of fresh air and adds new excitement to the hulk character,3
3595,i can't wait to see the way that paul rudd as ant-man he brings the humor and approachability needed for the role,3
3596,is a very entertaining film but inferior to the first in many ways gotg2 is still a very entertaining ride,3
3597,but it did set up for these movies nicly even if it wasn't front and center here,3
3598,however i do agree that im remains the best of the two volumes the daughters of thanos definitely fight without reservations,3
3599,ant-man is another solid entry to the mcu that just about manages to hold off its spoof feel,3
3600,however despite a poor recasting a rehash and so on we have a good versus bad story to be told,3
3601,not bad not great not spider-man 2 captain america the winter soldier 2014 as it was not until captain america civil war,3
3602,6 10 definitely one of the better marvel films,3
3603,i enjoyed it but not the best they've done,3
3604,it's great but as great as the first one but it's very disappointing,3
3605,the plot of iron man 3 is the writing,3
3606,fun but not as fun as the first iron man was always going to be a hard act to follow,3
3607,good movie loved the voice actor for ultron but not as good as the first one the fight scenes aren't necessarily the black panther,3
3608,if i may say i prefer they make two parts of this movie is great better than the first two but still lacks originality,3
3609,marvel has finally made the avengers and it has a very timely subject matter,3
3610,there's nothing in this film that is really cringeworthy,3
3611,rdj continues to shine as tony stark however for most of the film i think that was my favourite bit,3
3612,also his death didn't have the same seriousness the same dark tone of some of the crew in the glass door,3
3613,loved tom holland as spider-man and to compare them all,3
3614,this is a sad reality given the amount of fan fare surrounding this film,3
3615,good for a laugh but pales in comparison to the original iron man 2 still brings us great visuals comedy and acceptable writing,3
3616,that was the best thing about this new spider-man movie by far,3
3617,ed norton is the perfect choice for ant-man but also the problem for marvel universe,3
3618,all in all enjoyable but not one of the exceptions but is still plenty of fresh dazzle and solid supporting cast to go around,3
3619,this one happens to be more enjoyable and funny than the first but it still had many imperfections,3
3620,but one can't help but feel a little disappointed with this film,3
3621,although the film feels uneven at times and the built up anger throughout fizzles away,3
3622,it can get poorly acted and predictable but it's also yet another solo marvel film that's a sign that something was missing,3
3623,take the humor of guardians of the galaxy took were sheer fun,3
3624,the incredible hulk is much better than ed norton as bruce banner the hulk and he's really good,3
3625,paul rudd is amazing as ant-man will mix with the rest of the film,3
3626,i would have liked to see them develop even more even if it is nearly the exact plot of the incredibles,3
3627,the movie's biggest flaw however is that it spends a decent amount of superhero films this day and age,3
3628,but the script the chemistry between the characters the humor the performances and the action is good but the end looks like the matrix reloaded,3
3629,it's not as good and the villain doesn't get enough screen time,3
3630,on that note this film is a relatively decent sequel,3
3631,making a hulk movie is probably one of the most remarkable comebacks in cinematic history,3
3632,acing was good in this as well with the mandarin stuff,3
3633,guardians was a lot of great moments,3
3634,i have always dug paul rudd and he really makes this movie stand a little above stuff like transformers and g,3
3635,it's one of the best ones but as great as the first but still decent,3
3636,also didn't like the rest of the score is bland,3
3637,spider-man may not be a necessary addition in civil war but if you love marvel movies then of course you did,3
3638,loved this movie wasn't bad but could've been better,3
3639,elizabeth olsen wanda maximoff scarlet witch is also a better rhodes than terrence howard,3
3640,but it was still a fun super-hero movie just ok i guess for an easy evening,3
3641,the ultimate adventure of armored it's still not as good as the first film iron man 2 is an unfortunate misfire for marvel,3
3642,because of certain story issues it was definitely one of the weaker mcu films and i'll have to give it 70 %,3
3643,various kinds of some easter eggs have become one of the most influential events in movie history,3
3644,the humour felt forced and the visuals were weak for the first half or so and william hurt is pretty good,3
3645,the presence of tony stark throughout the movie i was also not to happy with liv tyler's betty ross however occurs almost abruptly,3
3646,at least it would if it wasn't meant to tie into the mcu,3
3647,as for setting up movies it does to that but it could have been a touch better with minor tweaks,3
3648,it really didn't bring anything new to the table and this is just a really mediocre movie,3
3649,it may be inferior to the end of tony's temper tantrum,3
3650,this movie makes the best of the marvel lot but it's good,3
3651,im3 has a lot of flaws and it's definatley one of the weakest offerings from the mcu,3
3652,sam rockwell knocks justin hammer out of the park as vulture and finally delivers another good marvel villain,3
3653,it's ok but the reason it's not as good as first ant-man imo more fun and less cringe for me,3
3654,better than the last one but still not as bad as i was told,3
3655,there's a perfunctory showdown with a supervillain in the third act with endless action and fight sequences,3
3656,who will later be the villain in avengers infinity war an epic action-packed adventure,3
3657,like all marvel movies ant-man isn't the finest in the marvel cinematic universe,3
3658,this film had some good jokes and i laughed from time to time with great performance by rdj,3
3659,full of non-stop fast-paced action with great acting which is what this is,3
3660,and the final scenes are with the rest of the mcu it does make sense how the antagonist comes about,3
3661,if the point of the iron man trilogy,3
3662,guardians of the galaxy is trying to create and while not overly inventive it is still a fun film with exciting action sequences,3
3663,additionally i'd like to mention an issue that seems to be going through the motions forgettable but okay,3
3664,as a film it is better than the obvious and this isn't,3
3665,he praised holland as terrific and well-cast as well as the ability the script has to poke fun at itself,3
3666,you're going to have a lot of hole in the story in this one like i did the other spidey flicks,3
3667,there are also flaws with some of the action scenes are fittingly insane and feature numerous shrinking car chases,3
3668,ant-man and the wasp is the worst marvel movie but i'm more of a dc guy now please deal with it,3
3669,i do wish he was used better but i'm not upset by what we did get,3
3670,the romance between banner and betty ross is nicely handled in this film and shows the hulk as he should,3
3671,and where in the world is going on,3
3672,sam rockwell as justin hammer is the main villain but when her back story is relieved not so much,3
3673,it's the worst marvel movie i've watched so far but definitely entertaining,3
3674,while corey stoll gave a great performance though it's nothing we haven't seen them before,3
3675,iron man 2 lacks the intrigue that the first film had which perfectly melded together humour and touching moments,3
3676,chadwick boseman did fantastic as the black panther in captain america civil war and force him into helping them nab janet from oblivion,3
3677,this movie was entertaining but not as good as everyone says it is but it is still good fun,3
3678,overstuffed plot points and a highly disappointing villain age of ultron doesn't work as well as its predecessor,3
3679,characters 3 5ant-man and the wasp 3 out of 5 heroes,3
3680,chadwick boseman is by far the better of the previous spider-men,3
3681,the movie itself didn't amuse me as much as other films did but it wasn't enough,3
3682,tim roth as the villain is very intimidating and even has a little comedy to him,3
3683,let's be clear here even though i consider the ant-man suit and fight alongside the wasp,3
3684,too many things going on at once too many characters and subplots a failing of far too many films in the mcu,3
3685,very good addition to the iron man trilogy is not quite as good as the other movies,3
3686,lastly the fight scene at the racetrack is a highlight of the film is solved too easily,3
3687,don't get me wrong i love to laugh and most of this movie is the superhero porn i never knew i needed,3
3688,i hope there isn't another spider-man origin story and thank goodness this isn't one,3
3689,5 10 this was a good time and better than iron man 2 but this film was missing jon favreau's touch,3
3690,mickey rourke doesn't do a good job special effects are good and the bad guy is alright but at the end of the day,3
3691,sam rockwell knocks justin hammer out of the park as vulture and finally delivers another good marvel villain,3
3692,overall iron man 2 impresses with the performances the humor the action sequences are cool and the fighting ispossibly some of the best,3
3693,great movie but the only thing i liked about this movie there was nothing about it that i loved,3
3694,to be honest i liked the first antman much better,3
3695,this is on a much smaller scale than most of the depressing dc movies of late except wonder woman ofcourse,3
3696,2018-6-15 better than i thought it would be a real challenge to ascertain for sure that the film is just bizarre,3
3697,from the opening music it's clear that iron man 3 is still a great entry to the series,3
3698,i loved this movie to a fresh grade,3
3699,plenty of good ideas and a story that is very sub-par to the first movie,3
3700,can you dear reader remember an original song from a marvel film like the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
3701,but ok the hulk smashes here so i guess i'm goofy like that kanye shrug one star for the direction and special effects,3
3702,its attempts to get you to care about the characters or get invested in the story,3
3703,however it was a pretty good movie even though it was a bit too overrated but fun to watch,3
3704,a dark story about a dark character the incredible hulk manages to have a decent narrative and fine acting,3
3705,iron man 2 not as great as the first one a bit better than black panther,3
3706,honestly it's not nearly as good as the first installment,3
3707,not a great addition to the marvel canon,3
3708,the russo brothers did a great job in their roles,3
3709,rotten tomatoes critical consensus reads spider-man homecoming was able start very quickly,3
3710,replace ivan vanko with a more relatable villain and iron man 2 tried too hard to succeed but it ultimately fails,3
3711,better than the 2nd not better than the first iron man movie but it's still not their best work,3
3712,i won't reveal who but i will say that it was a remake tribute reissue or adaptation,3
3713,the only real issues that i had with the original ant-man was very good,3
3714,revisiting iron man a few years later i was able to forgive more than condemn while watching this movie,3
3715,there were many scenes in spider-man homecoming fits right in with the previous installments of the mcu and keeps the ant-man,3
3716,new characters are introduced to and for me this is what i come up with as fun as the first,3
3717,i know some adults didn't connect with this one like i did the other spidey flicks,3
3718,the film also feels less like a film and more on setting up future instalments of the franchise,3
3719,elizabeth olsen wanda maximoff scarlet witch is also a better rhodes than terrence howard,3
3720,he is not as cool as the x-men's asgard wakanda dr,3
3721,it's a good movie but not great,3
3722,plot performances and a variety of actors make this the best iron man of the trilogy so far,3
3723,this was the real antagonist of iron man 2's flaws but succeeding in other ways iron man 3 is far less re-watchable,3
3724,just to be clear i love comic book characters brought to life on the big screen for so long you shouldn't be disappointed,3
3725,it's one of the few marvel movies that i've seen so far in the mcu,3
3726,sad to say this does not match up to the 1st and 3rd but it is still really good,3
3727,the ending crashes and not in a fun comic book adventure for fans of the original material and a bunch of action sequences,3
3728,wolverine beast the fantastic four spider-man and a variety of actors make this the best iron man film,3
3729,i really enjoyed this spider-man film or the best marvel film captain america winter soldier guardians and iron man are much better,3
3730,avengers age of ultron is instead one of marvel's most well-known superheroes,3
3731,the type of guy that was ant man isn't the finest in the marvel cinematic universe and concluding the iron man trilogy,3
3732,the excitement for this movie is way too high make me feels like this movie is a part of the avengers,3
3733,i personally prefer the first one but not quite as good as the first one but still very entertaining,3
3734,this movie is an improvement over its predecessor,3
3735,vin diesel as baby groot is the best thing about this new spider-man movie,3
3736,overall the incredible hulk is an improvement over iron man 2,3
3737,i give ant-man just 3 out of 5 stars for entertainment value,3
3738,the effects are quite honestly some of the best elements while still remaining a pretty unique take,3
3739,then again given the mesmerising character from the first movie is more darker amp serious than the sequel,3
3740,infused with tons of traditional culture it was a bit overhyped with little or no back story,3
3741,not at all but for me this film had the burden of answering the question then what,3
3742,what really held this movie back was the villain i don't know what they were thinking on making the mandarin lame,3
3743,lots of amazing action sequences but yeah it's not the best but it was ok,3
3744,can't wait to see ant-man in the movies is just beginning,3
3745,another fun film but very weak on character development and too many of the jokes fell flat,3
3746,this and a rather disappointing ending are what hold this movie back from being considered as good as its predecessor in its second half,3
3747,it's not to say that the film is all about iron man for better and for worse,3
3748,much better than the last hulk film but the new cast isn't as good as the first film vol,3
3749,weird but overall it was a good movie but just a bad villian,3
3750,a reboot that could have been much better than it was,3
3751,when i saw this movie i thought it was entertaining enough to see at least once,3
3752,the sets production values costuming and character visuals are off-the-wall everything they say is so bizarre,3
3753,as i said i am not a marvel fan either,3
3754,the writing in this film is the weakest of the marvel movies,3
3755,2 overcome some of its problems is the fact that he got recast in later films,3
3756,the plot was alright and the action is just really cool,3
3757,still it may be a little too much which undercuts some of the more traditional action sequences later in the film,3
3758,stay till the end of the movie was pretty good,3
3759,not as good as the first iron man to which it does not,3
3760,this film will suffer in comparison with the original iron man had,3
3761,more clever then the first one but it still is decent,3
3762,however like many others i had huge expectations especially after the unexpected success of the first film,3
3763,but i did find this movie to be a lot of fun re-watching this movie and it didn't feel natural,3
3764,a film that can stand on it's own but was lacking as a spider-man movie,3
3765,better then the ang lee detected hulk movie and it's nice to see even he can be human feelings too,3
3766,had a low expectation for this movie and it didn't quite live up to the first and with cute little groot,3
3767,what they did with some of the choices made for character,3
3768,the movie is cluttered with too many characters and some just don't and it seems like a massive stall on his character arc,3
3769,but ok the hulk smashes here so i guess i'm the only one bothered by it,3
3770,this one was more intense captivating and with a lot of action with a bit of a douche,3
3771,civil war is due out and it's going to be back by the end of avengers 4,3
3772,good special effects and solid performances all round from an all-star performance from the og 3 avengers,3
3773,following the battle of new york in the original avengers,3
3774,at this point the marvel cinematic universe the incredible hulk still can't find it's human side,3
3775,while it's narrative stumbles at times iron man 2 gets 3 5 stars b,3
3776,not as much humor as the first one although it has some fun scenes,3
3777,i will say it's better than the original or the avengers version of bruce,3
3778,it was a good movie it is a great comic book movie and a modern-day monster movie,3
3779,that scene was cringe-worthy and it felt like they were setup to play a more important role in the mcu,3
3780,the problem with this film is the weakest of the mcu films to date,3
3781,it's great to see the thor iron man hulk and so sick of captain america,3
3782,however i was surprised that they changed star-lord's father is a god,3
3783,was a little confused as to the concept of this film and feel it deserves more credit than it receives,3
3784,but anyways the movie was good but it wasn't a directed by edgar wright is still pretty good,3
3785,a good movie but it falls flat on its face as a superhero movie i think there are many better ones out there,3
3786,i've said this in all my previous marvel reviews but this movie has a lot going on becoming way too overstuffed,3
3787,they did pretty good juggling so many characters and has a worthy but cliched villain,3
3788,their origin was obviously completely different from the comics but i feel it could have been a whole lot worse,3
3789,iron man 3 was not the best way to kick off the summer of 2015 and did it exceed expectations,3
3790,the addition of an ant army to ant-man as much as i thought it would be but it was entertaining,3
3791,ant-man and the wasp has a lot of action and some really cool action,3
3792,as entertaining as this movie is it's not as slick as it's predecessor but rdj added more depth too tony stark iron man,3
3793,all-in-all ant-man is a back seat marvel cinematic universe superhero and a little too all-powerful,3
3794,the plot was sort of a rescue mission and i guess it worked but was a step back,3
3795,perhaps this has less to do with the original iron man,3
3796,doctor strange also uses the time stone to correct all wrongs,3
3797,in iron man 2 but for being the conclusion to the iron man trilogy,3
3798,overall this film is a bit too long but when they worked they worked,3
3799,all in all not as good as iron man 1,3
3800,of course this movie has problems but this is one of the most satisfying in iãâ¢ tmve seen in a long time,3
3801,obviously there's still the over-the-top due to some of the emotional scenes,3
3802,missing the humor of the other marvel movies to enjoy it,3
3803,the movie also has an all-star cast manages to deliver a hilarious and surprisingly emotional movie,3
3804,iron man 2 is nowhere near as dark as garfields spiderman,3
3805,this film is directed by louis leterrier who does a decent job is not very likable unfortunately,3
3806,no new concept but still a good watch if you have the time,3
3807,this is not only the best superhero movie i've seen just about every one of them,3
3808,5 so this has to be the most slovenly soldier i've ever seen they were practically seamless,3
3809,it's more grounded than one would expect but the incredible hulk is still a fun ride,3
3810,of course the first one came as more of a selfish gangster who disliked peter quill,3
3811,i love the first movie and plenty of action to keep people coming back for more,3
3812,i would also argue that it is the man that makes the suit and not vice versa after all,3
3813,hyde story to run with backingfrom the success of the first avengers movie avengers age of ultron is action packed humorous and somewhat fun,3
3814,the story suffers for it and because there is so much that is great about iron man 3 is the writing,3
3815,a mediocre follow-up to ant-man as much as i thought it would be a fun franchise,3
3816,it shows that tony stark is a dismissive jerk and this time it's literal,3
3817,and better than iron man 2 and thor the dark world the incredible hulk reintroduces this character in a great way,3
3818,a substantially better version then it's predecessor and when it focuses on developing that idea it excels,3
3819,despite those flaws ant-man is besides the fact that it's hulk's first adventure,3
3820,still fun but not as tight and consistent as the first one but it has impressive action scenes and great acting from rdj,3
3821,credit must be given to edward norton whose bruce banner is a scientist and can transform into being a human to the haulk,3
3822,yeah some things could have been better in major aspects but it's not too bad and i would watch it again,3
3823,so let's hope the next one is a little better but overall movie is not funny but somewhat letdown sequel,3
3824,this film is not as good as the first avengers movie but i thought it could have been directed by anyone,3
3825,but ok the hulk smashes here so i guess i'm the only one bothered by it,3
3826,maybe some comic book nerds hate that but it's a mostly fun and acceptable summer escapade,3
3827,it is way better than the previous cartoonish adaptation,3
3828,light fun simple superhero moviesynopsis scott lang paul rudd takes up the mantle of the ant-man,3
3829,not near as good as the first film or some of the other actor actresses were a bit of a strange choice dr,3
3830,we didn't need another spider-man film for sure,3
3831,homecoming is simply fun and stays true to the comics but my only problem with it was how boring it was,3
3832,the choice of yellowjacket for antagonist was solid as well and the hulk as always is the balls,3
3833,once again knocks it out of the way this movie is so fun,3
3834,never against him as i like the actor and a joy to watch on the big screen for so long you shouldn't be disappointed,3
3835,one side character's actions seem like a bit of a departure from the previous iron man films,3
3836,then he of course proves that he was the perfect choice for bruce banner,3
3837,the climax between the hulk and abomination is great and thrilling,3
3838,i can't wait to see ant-man in the movies is just beginning,3
3839,one of those films that while i did enjoy the acting and adding in black widow was an extra bonus,3
3840,and while the action sequences are still nice,3
3841,some will balk at the lower level of stakes in the ant-man suit and fight alongside the wasp,3
3842,the scene at the end of the day this is a comic book movie and just a good movie to whatch,3
3843,given what the producers and director were handed in ant-man's perspective from macro photography through the subatomic,3
3844,i hope there isn't another spider-man origin story and thank goodness this isn't one,3
3845,there may be too many story arcs and whiplash kinda sucks but iron man 2 still brings us the wonderful character robert downey jr,3
3846,unable to capture the magic that was the first film so it fits,3
3847,this movie survives on political premise alone not a bad movie but its flaws tend to show more often,3
3848,it's great to see the thor iron man hulk and so sick of captain america,3
3849,it's got a lot of the time watching it,3
3850,although not the best iron man but it bets any marvel movie,3
3851,cool scenes of hulk smashing things real good,3
3852,then it was way to many characters used in the movie but overall a good action-driven spectacle that fans will enjoy,3
3853,of course i'd have to say that it's not the dark knight,3
3854,i like how bruce banner has come to terms with the hulk and adding a great villain that makes the movie larger,3
3855,a great film for one coming out of the marvel universe but it's also an entertaining ride,3
3856,i really enjoyed tim roth in this film and tyler portrays ross wonderfully,3
3857,a serious twitch off olsen as well and the suit was very nice,3
3858,i always like to think of films individually butwith the marvel cinematic universe thanks to all the greatness it has within,3
3859,and in some cases given little in the way of the more low-key scenes,3
3860,a fun romp but don't expect it to replay fondly in your memories,3
3861,the introduction of don cheadle was also a plus for this film and i really wish norton could have stayed for avengers,3
3862,this movie is visually impressive but the story is all over the place,3
3863,honestly it's not nearly as good as the first one and how it was shot bit this is a better film,3
3864,it really was but i still feel that iron man could have used a little more screen-time,3
3865,betty ross isn't very developed too i wanted it to be with the movie or ending it is still satisfying,3
3866,with more disappointment than satisfaction iron man 3 was kind of a deadbeat criminal,3
3867,despite not being quite on the level of avengers 1 or 3,3
3868,the villain is quite poor and the story as a whole is bland since that city is full of personality and life,3
3869,also some of the action is good but the story is flat and basic and the loss of jeff bridges stinks,3
3870,the movie continues shortly after the events of the first iron man,3
3871,the guardians of the galaxy vol 1 great or ironman great or captain america winter soldier guardians and iron man are much better,3
3872,janet van dyne was another weak character as i didn't like was the twist on the mandarin,3
3873,this might sound a little redundant or stupid but ant-man succeed in it's own way,3
3874,it is unfortunately let down by a weak second half,3
3875,i love the plane scene and it's the best at letting michael rooker be amazing that's for sure,3
3876,like the first movie there aren't many things he isn't good in,3
3877,of course i'd have to say that it's not another origin story,3
3878,but you will never have to watch it again but it was worthwhile time suck,3
3879,i felt this movie had a hard time seeing who is the main one,3
3880,the incredible hulk may not have much substance but it makes up for that with great visuals and an amazing final battle,3
3881,some great characters and some really cool scenes but it was a little slow for me,3
3882,the issue here is that it could never reach the heights of the avengers and the near-death experience in the avengers,3
3883,this very well could have been the hulk in all of the movies back to back in order,3
3884,smh it's a shame you don't understand the hype or its record-breaking box office at all,3
3885,elizabeth olsen wanda maximoff scarlet witch is also a better rhodes than terrence howard,3
3886,so let's hope the next one is a little better but overall movie is not funny but somewhat letdown sequel,3
3887,a must see for fans of of the marvel superhero movies i've seen,3
3888,i was rooting for michael b jordan's character put a bit of a star wars feel about it,3
3889,i'm not gon na say that i didn't like was the twist on the mandarin,3
3890,a good action flick but didn't quite get paul rudd,3
3891,then it was way to many characters used in the movie but overall a good action-driven spectacle that fans will enjoy,3
3892,great movie but not quite as good as its predecessor in its second half,3
3893,end credits scene sets up the further marvel cinematic universe and concluding the iron man trilogy,3
3894,strong performances but it's not terrible it's fine,3
3895,as far as building up a sequel there's a minor post-credit scene of the marvel universe in general with great actors,3
3896,cool scenes of hulk smashing things real good,3
3897,though the actors are all great but the story is really weak,3
3898,i was genuinely hoping that this film would be good as i didn't like it as much as the hulk,3
3899,there is a massive hate and bad critics towards this movie because of the twist with the mandarin,3
3900,however should a person wish to only hit the major points the best of the marvel superhero movies i've seen,3
3901,it's rather frustrating given the fact that it's just a ok movie,3
3902,i don't wanna say it kills the movie because it doesn't live up to the hype,3
3903,paul rudd is amazing as ant-man he brings the humor and approachability needed for the role,3
3904,i can not wait for this movie to live up to the hype you,3
3905,if you're a fan of the other marvel movies to watch and understand this,3
3906,one of the most entertaining blockbusters out there but is by no means a a 5 star movie,3
3907,i was a little disappointed in it but it's just emblazoned as it delicious foods,3
3908,the storytelling could have a lot of hole in the story in this one like i did the other spidey flicks,3
3909,i must admit guardians of the galaxy is not without its merits because as the rating suggests i really enjoyed this movie,3
3910,besides the action i'm not very invested in the story or the characters at all,3
3911,that was funny epic and cute all at the same time i left the theater fairly satisfied,3
3912,of course the first one came as more of a rival to peter parker than a bully,3
3913,while holding strong themes the plot was all over the place still entertaining but the worst of the series of iron man films,3
3914,the movie doesn't really add up in the end and quit abruptly as being iron man,3
3915,at least there is amazing writing on josh brolin's thanos or michael b jordan's character by the end,3
3916,this movie seemed to benefit the wasp a little bit harder than i intended,3
3917,the action is solid for the most part fits well into the film,3
3918,it might be a rather flawed sequel but iron man 2 still brings us the wonderful character robert downey jr,3
3919,though it was filed with easter eggs and a great set of characters yet lacking in a solid plot,3
3920,5 6 2017 2 not quite as good as its predecessor but still disappointing,3
3921,iron man 2 has a bit of a strange choice dr,3
3922,but still impressive with great actors and a good story with another forgettable villain,3
3923,this was the last of the movies that i needed to catch up on the mcu you could probably skip this one,3
3924,taking on the role and jon favreau's passion for the story and colors of the iron man films this one is arguably my favorite,3
3925,tony stark is witty as always as to be expected by this point with mcu films the cinematography is great,3
3926,but in the end this film is just above average with an ok cast,3
3927,it's got clever action the comedy is on point and the cast is great the cg hulk looks amazing,3
3928,so who are these guardians of the galaxy is a worthy addition to the marvel universe,3
3929,theres even an avengers tie-in films although it doesn't reach the standard set by the first one,3
3930,good movie overall and great special effects that follows the predictable mcu template but is still a good one to watch,3
3931,and how else to start but with one of the villains offspring but that works,3
3932,tony stark is witty as always as to be expected by this point with mcu films the cinematography is great,3
3933,forced to conform to the conventions of being an origin story it's easier to like this film for what it could have been better,3
3934,all in all it's a good movie but not as good as the first but good fun,3
3935,a fresh rating of 61 % iron man 2 is still an exciting action film and robert downey jr,3
3936,all three of those films played a pivotal role in the civil war storyline that is critical to that phase,3
3937,in all i enjoyed my time with this movie but it was just missing too much of what made iron man great,3
3938,the best marvel movie not just iron man but it certainly did pack a punch,3
3939,i enjoyed age of ultron a little less than the first avengers but this felt way out of hand,3
3940,liked the film but it attempts to connect with the large team of heroes,3
3941,the villain is good but the story and the plot,3
3942,going back to the large action scene that climaxes the film it's one avenger taking on another,3
3943,a better film than its predecessor but couldn't reach up to the first iron man,3
3944,the characters are wonderfully diverse in race and personality and the supporting cast adds the needed elements around him,3
3945,i would say that it's not even iron man 1 but this lesser heart makes it not as fine a film,3
3946,the action is still readily available with charismatic characters to go along with my opinion i think this movie is bad,3
3947,the movies saving pros are johanssen and cheadle who is a much better adaptation then ang lee's piece of poo from tears ago,3
3948,i liked this movie but it won't be cheap,3
3949,it's pretty easy to feel underwhelmed after infinity war and the other recent marvel solo outings fell short this one does as well,3
3950,it doesn't feel too jokey to the point that she can send him messages in his subconscious,3
3951,sympathetic villain like erik killmonger is great but the villains here are weakly layered and poorly executed,3
3952,in any regard this is a great start to the new spider-man went an exhilaratingly long way in captain america civil war,3
3953,overall i had so much fun watching this movie but that doesn't go anywhere until winter soldier,3
3954,decent follow up to the terrific iron man iron man who does magic and iron spider,3
3955,finally the use of jackson as nick fury is a perfect casting decision,3
3956,in the end ant-man and the wasp 3 out of 5,3
3957,i also didn't like the rest of the film,3
3958,the only difference is the kind of movie my dad would've enjoyed,3
3959,along with the line at the end when he has a spotlight on him,3
3960,the introduction of don cheadle was also a plus for this film and i'll address all of the major ones,3
3961,that he's constantly trying to fight off the hulk and that's then end of them,3
3962,chadwick boseman is by far the shining beacon in this film and had some of the best,3
3963,not as good as the first one but overall it's an entertaining watch,3
3964,it was also really nice to see pepper finally get to be more than just your friendly neighborhood spider-man,3
3965,i do think it is an improvement over its predecessor but still disappointing,3
3966,as lame funny good visual effects as compared to the rest of the film,3
3967,watch what happens in south africa 20 years from now and say that was a masterpiece,3
3968,some other little things were a pain in the ass and this movie wasn't as excited as the first avengers,3
3969,one other thing i didn't like her i just felt like he was there to attract an audience besides the comic nerds,3
3970,it's not a terrible movie but it is very enjoyable and doesn't pretend to be better than the genesis story that precedes it,3
3971,along with iron man it's still worth a watch or two,3
3972,good movie loved the voice actor for ultron but not as good as iron man like the commercials say but still pretty good,3
3973,but what got me was the hulk now he was one of the few marvel movies that i have seen,3
3974,here it's a more complex affair but that doesn't stop it being a fun couple of hours,3
3975,decent but too similar and not a patch on the first one though still entertains from beginning to end,3
3976,ant-man is more of a heist comedy film this is the one for you,3
3977,it's far from the best marvel movie ever made but not bad,3
3978,main characters in this movie include spiderman iron man captain america thor and now guardians of the galaxy takes place in strange planets as well,3
3979,uneven pacing keeps this from being one of marvel's most well-known superheroes,3
3980,this movie is definitely skippable compared to other mcu movies but it's easy to follow regardless,3
3981,iron man 2 is nowhere near as dark as garfields spiderman,3
3982,the pace is a little slow in places,3
3983,make sure you stick around for the mid-credits sequence is a weird tonal shift from the rest of the cast as well,3
3984,iron man 2 is still highly exciting with great action sequences and some humorous moments to make this ride worth while,3
3985,vulture is a great villain and some quality humor it can't help but compare to other recent releases,3
3986,the actors are all great but the story is really weak,3
3987,john-kamen and goggins also give solid performances but at the same time and the result is as muddled as that sounds,3
3988,although i always enjoy robert downey jr amp scarlett johansson i just couldn't get enough of this so keep em coming,3
3989,too many things going on at once too many characters and subplots a failing of far too many films in the genre,3
3990,i remember having so much fun watching this movie but that doesn't mean this is a bad movie,3
3991,so while it's not perfect and has a controversial twist but it's still a good time at the cinema,3
3992,it's meh to me i like it but i don't remember much but it was pretty forgettable like most mcu scores,3
3993,i hate to say it but this ain't half as good as the first avegers at times but falls short by the end,3
3994,however one of the things i most enjoyed about this movie was ultron and he was not used well,3
3995,tom holland in my opinion is still the best superhero movie and once again this is from a marvel fan,3
3996,light fun simple superhero moviesynopsis scott lang paul rudd takes up the mantle of the ant-man character,3
3997,if you want to see a heist comedy film than traditional superhero movie,3
3998,they made him into a bumbling idiot who was forcefully taken out of the equation like he was a petty thug,3
3999,the incredible hulk may not be as original or as fresh as the first one did,3
4000,shane black tells a darker iron man story that is a worthy follow up to iron man even though enjoyment can be found in it,3
4001,reference filled run of the mill summer flick,3
4002,still fun but not as fun as the first installment yet i appreciate the new faces in particular kurt russell,3
4003,the movie is good enough but i don't remember much but it was pretty forgettable like most mcu scores,3
4004,lilly is great as the low key whiplash and don cheadle is still happy to be here,3
4005,does their second outing together live up to the original like toy story,3
4006,but all in all it's a pretty good time nonetheless,3
4007,there's just too much like the last 5 movies,3
4008,the action is great as well as his co-stars all do a good job,3
4009,the villain was alright but there wasn't enough time to get attached,3
4010,there are also flaws with some of the choices made for character,3
4011,the second villain sonny burch is by no means the masterpiece it is regarded as,3
4012,the type of guy that was ant man isn't the finest outing in the marvel cinematic universe,3
4013,however it seems that avengers age of ultron is overwhelming at times but it is still really good,3
4014,i myself really didn't have the same drive as the first,3
4015,the big scene at the end of the day,3
4016,ant-man has a good mix of humor and seriousness isn't quite as good as in the first film,3
4017,less successful is tim roth as the villain is very theatrical and rarely convincing,3
4018,its not like the first one and a bit more unlogic,3
4019,however it is better the the stupid fantastic four movies and the first hulk movie to succeed unlike the 2003 version,3
4020,there was a little bit too perfect looking,3
4021,i think the star of the movie and i remember having a good time,3
4022,as the first sentence may allude to the first one but it still has its moments,3
4023,this movie lacks the grounded feel the first one had by introducing a clear villain for iron man to battle,3
4024,paul rudd is one of the weaker films of the mcu,3
4025,it looks even better than in the first and his costume is hugely improved,3
4026,it's completely elegant it's bafflingly beautiful and it's capable of busting a bunker under the bunker you just busted,3
4027,i didn't enjoy it as much as the first one but still has a lot to do with that,3
4028,obviously the weakest marvel film in phase 1 of the marvel cinematic universe getting so big that can be ratherdifficult to do,3
4029,it's that i've come to expect that in marvel movies not good,3
4030,as far as building up a sequel there's a minor post-credit scene is good post-credit one is useless,3
4031,marvel's the avengers is now one of the most visually-stunning movies in the mcu,3
4032,not as good or funny than the first but half the action scenes are well worth giving this movie watch,3
4033,it feels like a set up to him being a villain is expected but done very well,3
4034,pretty good movie but i wouldn't avoid it it's a fun watch,3
4035,solid follow up to what was never going to be as strong of a movie as the first one,3
4036,iron man 2 has a bit of a blessing in disguise,3
4037,not being particularly fond of guardians of the galaxy proved what marvel can really do with a license,3
4038,decent film but a bit of a blessing in disguise,3
4039,there's some good fun in this film that makes me want to watch the first one again,3
4040,there's nothing in this film that makes me want to watch the movie go watch the movie,3
4041,i'd say it isn't the worst marvel movie at least,3
4042,btw one of the few marvel movies that i've seen,3
4043,also a great villain in abomination and great fight scenes between him and iron man do not come through,3
4044,it's certainly not as strong as the first entry but still holds up well with downey jr,3
4045,iron man 2 is about as good as the first one or many of the other marvel movies to watch and understand this,3
4046,again good childish fun and that's all it takes to get it right,3
4047,wasn't a huge fan of the first ant-man was a solid superhero but i would have loved it,3
4048,if not for those 2 things spicing it up the film would have been 5 stars if michael pena was the lead,3
4049,very watchable its funny fresh and a good start to the mcu and homage to the superhero icon,3
4050,star lord finally gets to know his father only to kill him off in the final battle they wouldn't last very long at all,3
4051,boys liked it i was just not a huge fan of the first ant-man imo more fun and less cringe for me,3
4052,it doesn't have the same charm as the original and a lot of it hits but a good amount of screen time,3
4053,not as good as the first but not a bad film but not as good as the previous avengers movie,3
4054,the villain played by corey stoll has motivations that are all too familiar and the overall brand of the story,3
4055,it still was not as good as the first film or some of the other marvel films weve seen,3
4056,and really a big part of this movie,3
4057,of course they did so in a way where you don't have to be moronic overblown cgi messes and this isn't,3
4058,the story manages to hit most of the right notes and was well-written for the most part it works,3
4059,there really isn't much to talk about as the incredible hulk is an early and ultimately forgettable mcu addition,3
4060,also and spoilers for a movie that has weighty expectations on its shoulders,3
4061,this movie would have loved to see edgar wright's version wasn't the final cut for this movie,3
4062,i have to say i was left a bit empty walking out of the theater after the film was over,3
4063,i'm somewhat less invested in the villains of the film but it attempts to connect with the teenage kid audience a whole lot,3
4064,i know some adults didn't connect with this one like i did the other spidey flicks,3
4065,ant-man and the wasp is that the film feels the need to through a secondary villain into the mix,3
4066,also stay till the end of the standalone iron man movies,3
4067,and some remarkable set pieces make iron man 3 a welcome addition to the mcu but not enough to overshadow it,3
4068,it is worth seeing and is one of the premier comic book films of our age,3
4069,also and spoilers for a movie that has weighty expectations on its shoulders,3
4070,there is a good cgi lot of laughs and cool action and even a solid villain,3
4071,he feels he's held back by iron man so he wanted to make a action comedy movie with robert downey jr,3
4072,the reason i say this is that the film takes itself perhaps a bit too seriously,3
4073,and i wasn t impressed with the battle between the two sisters gamora and nebula reconciling after years of sibling rivalry,3
4074,it's not to say that iron man isn't a ton of fun and adding kurt russell was great,3
4075,toby reigns in my books but it was a fun execution with some awesome fighting scenes,3
4076,lucky for marvel disney there is a justifiable reason for all of the hype even if it wasn't meant to tie into the mcu,3
4077,i thought the action was good in this as well with the mandarin stuff,3
4078,a fun moive but no where as good as other marvel but not bad,3
4079,so much better than hulk in 2003 norton is solid in the role and thought the vulture twist was a positive direction for that character,3
4080,good but not that good but i wouldn't call the film hilarious i do like the 2 avengers better,3
4081,action scenes were great the plot is still enjoyable and seeing all of these heroes actors being on the big screen,3
4082,this movie was solid and that's really all i can say is their are two credit scenes,3
4083,just as ridiculous as the first one which i loved,3
4084,plus he wasn't even the same whiplash from the comics he should have been whiplash in this movie,3
4085,black widows entrance was the highlight of this movie was done very well and did not disappoint,3
4086,while it seems at first the film and characters have a hard time seeing edward norton as bruce banner,3
4087,i feel like this movie did not capture the spark of the original but seems a bit less focused,3
4088,sir if you're going to have a tough time filling his shoes,3
4089,at the end of the movie seems to imply the end of the second act he allows himself to be captured for really no reason,3
4090,he doesn't have the same punch as the first but still quite enjoyable,3
4091,certainly a step up from iron man 2 but in no way as good as the first doesn't mean it wasn't good enough,3
4092,apparently justin hammer is the best part of this film is a big lol,3
4093,sure it may not be the best mcu movie though,3
4094,watch what happens in south africa 20 years from now and say that was a masterpiece,3
4095,his transformation to iron man is fun and will entertain hulk fans of the source material as it doesn't live up to the first,3
4096,i did not expect it to be better than it really is unlike the dceu,3
4097,1st some of james spader's threatening performance,3
4098,like its lead performance the incredible hulk is an enjoyable movie with loads of action and enough intelligence especially in the end,3
4099,and i'm sorry but this could've been more of a realized character,3
4100,the story felt forced i didn't care much for mr,3
4101,overall iron man 2 for me was a fun movie just a bit to long but that's not saying this is a bad movie,3
4102,he is a true villain and one of the best solo superhero movies from marvel,3
4103,for the most part have allowed this movie to be more colorful than exciting or humorous,3
4104,just as peter parker tries to figure out his powers and what exactly to do with them,3
4105,but this movie was just a transition from the original movie like outdated technology per se but not entirely obsolete,3
4106,after the events of the first film but still has its moments,3
4107,i liked it but for me the first one was a masterpiece this is just ok,3
4108,still fun but not as tight and consistent as the first film but it was okay,3
4109,now ultron is my favorite marvel comic villain so there was a lot of fun and the story conclusively ends for iron man,3
4110,various kinds of some easter eggs have become one of the most overrated films in the history of ideas,3
4111,25 5peyton reed delivers an average film but he doesn't ruin the character or the fans,3
4112,the villain is good but the story is boring some of the jokes were just bad,3
4113,granted it's not a really great movie but i had a hard time seeing who is the main one,3
4114,superior to ang lee's 2003 film but it still lacked action and the story was well played out and action packed of course,3
4115,not as good as the first movie but hey it's a sequel,3
4116,the character was also a rather potent comedic draw and i can not stress how good this movie was not as good as iron man,3
4117,it would be five stars if it wasn't my favorite of the year,3
4118,a film that can stand on it's own merits though it's a fun alright superhero film,3
4119,the film's more humorous tone works but it's hard to find much to meaningfully hone in on and relate to,3
4120,it's good but not as good as the first but it doesn't fit stark's character it doesn't feel like enough,3
4121,as far as issues go iron man is a great edition to the mcu,3
4122,iron man is a great movie nor do i think it was a bit boring a bit confusing and a bit underwhelming,3
4123,this might sound a little redundant or stupid but ant-man isn t a particularly entertaining movie,3
4124,this would be 4 stars aside from it sagging a little too much action that makes the movie feel like a convoluted mess,3
4125,while i do think if they where going to start off the marvel cinematic universe thanks to all the greatness it has within,3
4126,although the action outweighs the actual emotion within the story avengers age of ultron is an acceptable addition to the marvel tableau of superhero movies,3
4127,truly it's his interactions with the supporting cast playing his high school peers,3
4128,i felt this movie had a lot to live up to,3
4129,we see the intro of nick fury and black widow are dead weight team members but still cool at times,3
4130,mostly just made me want to watch the movie go watch the movie,3
4131,no part of this movie was michael keaton as toomes,3
4132,better than avengers age of ultron feels focused more on what's to come which now that the avengers is out is dated,3
4133,i actually liked it more than the first,3
4134,tom holland was good as peter parker and spider-man 2 are all better films than this,3
4135,some will balk at the lower level of stakes in the ant-man just 2 out of 5 reels,3
4136,despite being quite dry at times it is still a exelent example of character building and is a great fit for playing the wasp,3
4137,like many superhero movies iron man 3 has its moments with visual action fun,3
4138,really enjoyable movie that doesn't make it a bad film,3
4139,my biggest problem with the film is that it doesn't up the ante,3
4140,now ultron is my favorite marvel comic villain so there was a lot of fun and i really enjoyed the film,3
4141,so much better than hulk in 2003 norton is solid in the role and thought the vulture twist was a positive direction for that character,3
4142,a fairly formulaic movie that still manages to be an enjoyably fun experience,3
4143,it's also enjoyable to find a villain who is completely uninteresting and has clichãâ © motives for his actions,3
4144,at the time it was new but after comparing it with the 15 years ago spider-man the suit is too much,3
4145,this would be 4 stars aside from it sagging a little too much action that makes the movie larger,3
4146,had trouble getting over the fact that this film is the use of humor to lighten up the events,3
4147,the action and special effects were good and the story was quite boring,3
4148,let's just say it this way iron man 2 was much less amusing that the first,3
4149,it's pretty good as a spider-man fan it bothers me,3
4150,it did just as good of a job as terrence howard in the sequel,3
4151,but there's a lot to complain of and it takes ages for the movie to be as silly as possible,3
4152,marvel's the avengers is now one of the most overrated films in the history of cinema,3
4153,though it was filed with easter eggs and a great set of characters yet lacking in a solid plot,3
4154,spider-man homecoming is sure to engage audiences as much as it maintains most of the magic in iron man,3
4155,it could have been a great movie but it was still entertaining,3
4156,but you will never have to watch it again it was good but e movie was unnecessary,3
4157,the special effects are good and the bad guy is going to do it is predictable,3
4158,ãâãâ ãâ ãâ ãâ ãâ ãâ ãâãâ¢ãâ ãâ ãâ ãâ ãâ ãâ ãâãâ¢ãâ ãâ ãâ ãâ ãâãâ ¦ o ãâãâ¢ãâãâ ¦,3
4159,it's great to see the thor iron man hulk and so sick of captain america,3
4160,they made him into a bumbling idiot who was forcefully taken out of the equation like he was a petty thug,3
4161,ant-man manages to be a bit too jokey for my liking but still good none the less,3
4162,terrance howard was a better choice out of the two options and it's a lot messier than the first movie,3
4163,anyway that gripe aside it's a well packed action movie at its best,3
4164,i di not want to watch this as i thought it would be a fun franchise,3
4165,tony spends most of the movie is very solid mostly it's competent like i would give it an 82 %,3
4166,to me this film seemed to have even less to do with the avengers we saw back in 2012,3
4167,another solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe,3
4168,but it did set up for these movies nicly even if it wasn't my favorite iron man movie,3
4169,it's more grounded than one would expect but the incredible hulk is somewhat an incomplete movie and a forgotten movie in the mcu,3
4170,i was comparing it to the first iron man film like the story character development and actoin,3
4171,killmonger was interesting and even though he didn't get much to do in this one and core to the plot to boot,3
4172,bit of a dead fish when it comes to making a sequel that already was kind of dull,3
4173,the villain was setup right at the beginning of the film which was seeing all these heroes together and kicking ass,3
4174,there is some emotional heft to some parts of the movie just felt entirely forced and unnatural,3
4175,secondly and even more surprisingly is the fact that it is a fun step back,3
4176,a mediocre follow-up to the previous ant-man is the best character,3
4177,i for one didn't leave guardians of the galaxy but i think this franchise is definitely better than say the tobey maguire spiderman movies,3
4178,tuesday afternoon is a good time for sure but not good either,3
4179,good movie but not a good one,3
4180,continues adding depth though not tremendous depth to all of the characters mixed in storylines and motives,3
4181,however despite a poor recasting a rehash and so on we have a good versus bad story to be told,3
4182,performances all round were excellent especially from tom holland and michael keaton's performances and jon watts direction,3
4183,besides that this is one of the best we've had,3
4184,71%it's more of the same well but the plot and story was cheesy but i liked paul rudd in it,3
4185,this is a satisfying conclusion to the iron man trilogy iron man 3 is as entertaining a film as you can get,3
4186,ok but it really didn't bring anything new to the table and this is just a really mediocre movie,3
4187,it's just that it was a good movie not one of those wow amazing films though,3
4188,i gave it 4 stars the night i saw the film i honestly was worried about how it would deliver,3
4189,i'd assumed this was the whole idea of the film but with the overall arc of the mcu it feels seemingly pointless and inconsequential,3
4190,extra content making of an ant-man sequel ant-man and the wasp serves as another worthy addition to the marvel family,3
4191,a snappy pacy first half is let down by a cartoonish and absurd final battle sequence,3
4192,don't be put off by the lack of action scenes preety much an enjoyable movie,3
4193,ant-man and the wasp aren't going to kill our heroes anyway,3
4194,as i already said this wasn't really much of an iron man movie it's better than the 2003 film though,3
4195,however after watching a second time i can see why janet is missing but i hope she can return someday,3
4196,casting was improved with ed norton as bruce banner though it's a fun alright superhero film,3
4197,you felt his presence every time he was on screen i didn't question it,3
4198,like in some of the battles you can hardly understand the characters and of course it was hilarious,3
4199,you're the world's greatest grandma ant-man and the vulture out of this movie so as not to alienate any audience,3
4200,it's a marvel film of course there are far worse fates to attain,3
4201,on top of that the film is titled avengers age of ultron is an action packed romp that will satisfy viewers,3
4202,i really enjoyed tim roth in this film and is probably the best to play spider-man so much,3
4203,i liked tom holland as spider-man and parents may not let their kids watch this,3
4204,entertaining as ever even if it isn't as impactful as the first one,3
4205,ego was kind of forgettable and some of the action scenes were good,3
4206,great movie but not quite as good as its predecessor but it is a bit silly,3
4207,seriously though he's always been great but i don't know why but they really scare me,3
4208,however i can't really pinpoint exactly why age of ultron doesn't quite live up to the comic story line,3
4209,although i think i have to agree with the general consensus that this is the weakest of the films staring the avengers characters,3
4210,not as great as i expected but still a good fun time to be had,3
4211,it was a fine idea having an avenger in the movie so he scraped the bottom of the pit,3
4212,3 10 watch it if you're bored or need to kill time,3
4213,despite that iron man 2 is that is a good movie and right on par with the second,3
4214,i liked the changes for the most part and unlike most people i was pretty disappointed with this movie,3
4215,good special effects and solid performances all round from an all-star performance from the og 3 avengers,3
4216,some of the humor the film was going for and by the end i was beginning to lose interest,3
4217,one of the problems i had with the original ant-man,3
4218,a pretty good sequel and just as good as the first one but it still is a good movie spectacular scenery and great ideas,3
4219,the bulk of the plot revolves around her and her parents to the point where the loud humor is almost too stupid and relentless,3
4220,it's not a really amazing movie but it's also an entertaining ride,3
4221,it's uneven for sure but this is still one of the better movies this year so far,3
4222,had a low expectation for this movie and it didn't quite live up to the first iteration,3
4223,first and foremost is in focusing more on the action and the comedy but this one is so different,3
4224,a pretty good john hughes style coming-of-age origin though this tale assumes it isn't,3
4225,it doesn't live up to the stronger more emotional aspects of the film especially one intended for youthful audiences,3
4226,at this point the marvel cinematic universe raising the stakes for all future marvel films to come while being just as fun as the first,3
4227,and who could ever forget the newly appointed ceo of stark industries with tony sidelined with other issues,3
4228,ant-man and the wasp is a fun sequel that has villain and stakes problems,3
4229,good movie all together however i was disappointed with the lack of truly awkward geeky and out of place peter,3
4230,didnt care for rourke as the villain takes away from robert downey jr,3
4231,during his first transformation bruce seriously injured his girlfriend betty ross liv tyler and forced to hide from his nemesis gen,3
4232,the way thanos so easily gets some of the infinity stones and he is in a body of water,3
4233,a better instalment than the original with a great villain powerful story and strong performances,3
4234,after the success of the first film but still fun,3
4235,how could i forget to rate this movie when i was in oakland california,3
4236,after a gat first film this being the third entry in the marvel cinematic universe getting so big that can be ratherdifficult to do,3
4237,age of ultron is a lot funnier and action packed than the first oh and also more hulk,3
4238,not as fresh as the first one and was extremely excited to see the next volume,3
4239,josh whedon has already announced that he won't be returning for avengers 3,3
4240,it's enjoyable once you look past the writing and i'm sure to some people one of the worst marvel movie though,3
4241,at this point wash rinse and repeat scenario in my opinion,3
4242,even though it was touching it didn't really fit in the movie and didn't feel very present or well threatening,3
4243,and honestly that's not something that i thought i'd revisit the film that so many seemed to love,3
4244,iron man 3 was not the best way to kick off the summer of 2015 and did it exceed expectations,3
4245,iron man is sleek well orchestrated madness and that is what makes a good action movie,3
4246,a step down from the first sight of the best super hero movies ever made and i still think that it is,3
4247,while it is not as good as the first avengers film skirted the line between pure action and story fairly well,3
4248,the post-credit scene of the marvel universe's superheroes,3
4249,the first marvel film i've seen for a while,3
4250,tom holland is the best spider-man next to the very first one,3
4251,on top of that the structure of the film just aren't that interesting,3
4252,much better than i thought he'd be,3
4253,it features a very promising villain that could also be the ones to save it from total destruction,3
4254,very good addition to the iron man films of which the first was easily the best in the phase 2 series,3
4255,because in my opinion this ends up feeling like its own movie instead of interconnecting to everything else,3
4256,the villain isn't great but downey jr,3
4257,truth be told i yawned a lot but it doesn't really cohere like it should,3
4258,i saw the movie yesterday and i have to say it was a great character moment for both of them,3
4259,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and part 2 cool,3
4260,good movie but not as a stand alone film,3
4261,while there's a lot to like here,3
4262,honestly it's not nearly as good as the first movie,3
4263,again though this may not necessarily be the movie's fault itself as much as it should,3
4264,i felt the villain especially was quite lacking felt more like a comedy than part of the mcu,3
4265,the sub plot and the villain are dull and disappointing,3
4266,title iron manstory writing message plot 4character acting 4music sound 1cinematography editing 4age originality 4total 15 25,3
4267,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but not necessarily a memorable one,3
4268,ugh what can i say it is the marvel cinematic universe,3
4269,they could have easily chopped 15-20 minutes of the film the little kid in me was chomping at the bit,3
4270,great cast of characters and flash thompson being portrayed as more of a surprise but still successful action and humor,3
4271,now don't get me wrong it was great it's just somehwere in the middle,3
4272,as i said i am not a marvel fan either,3
4273,it feels like a long time ago now but i didn't really get the whole thing with the fire people,3
4274,the chemistry is still solid even with the introduction of new characters who are not disinteresting compared to the original,3
4275,but you will never have to watch it again but it was worthwhile time suck,3
4276,always been a fan of his secret family and moving the film to a certain extent and thought it was fairly entertaining throughout,3
4277,the dynamic that worked with the characters in the first one it still keeps you interested and paul rudd is the perfect scott lang,3
4278,however after watching a second time i still feel that people were too harsh on joss whedon,3
4279,great film better than the first avengers movie all over again,3
4280,by its very nature the stakes in ant-man it is michael douglas,3
4281,it was a great movie but it was just missing too much of what made iron man great,3
4282,maybe that has to with the fact that he's still got a lot to learn,3
4283,there's nothing in this film that sometimes overshadows everything else but it's easy to follow regardless,3
4284,much better than its predecessor in some ways and a fairly standard comic book action movie in others,3
4285,they don't really do much for me,3
4286,this entry was directed and i think written by shane black who had some good ideas but also some terrible ones,3
4287,but hey as i said after ang lees debacle it's nice to see even he can be human feelings too,3
4288,my chief complaint for this film is a relatively decent sequel,3
4289,first and foremost is in focusing more on the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
4290,not quite but this is one of the hardest things to do,3
4291,however the action and cg were very strong and the acting was once again strong,3
4292,i'm gon na be brutally frank here most of this movie is the superhero porn i never knew i needed,3
4293,it's the worst marvel movie but i can't help but not feel intense when it tries to be,3
4294,good but not up to par with the other marvel movies to enjoy it,3
4295,mostly just made me want to watch the movie go watch the movie,3
4296,can you dear reader remember an original song from a marvel film like the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
4297,the villain is so-so but the laughs make up for it in the parts that are entertaining,3
4298,to the chagrin of ed norton it's still a great movie none the less,3
4299,also and spoilers for a movie that has to accommodate an estimated 76 characters it was pretty good for action scenes from what i remember,3
4300,norton is great i like banner alot more than hulk in this film and even though i don't know vision was really great,3
4301,it is nice to see a different film,3
4302,one of marvel's stronger movies but it's certainly a drop in quality from the first iron man,3
4303,this movie seemed to benefit the wasp a little bit harder than i intended,3
4304,while not the smoothest marvel movie this is one hell of a first post-credits sting,3
4305,amazing special effects just leaves you a little unhappy compared to the first one but a welcomed sequel,3
4306,much better than a lot of mcu movies have this villain-of-the-way from marvel films and marvel comics and studios,3
4307,i get it we all love the music in this movie but nothing fell short either it was just a good movie to see,3
4308,i gave it 4 stars the night i saw the film i honestly was worried about how it would deliver,3
4309,this is not one of the best comic book movie,3
4310,the director purposely planned this movie to be more colorful than exciting or humorous,3
4311,a well-made movie with characters you care about are put to the test in interesting ways,3
4312,of course i'd have to say that it's a curse not just a superpower that's afflicting bruce,3
4313,i mostly recommend you watch this film when you haven't invested much in it that irritation becomes dangerously off-putting,3
4314,the first ant men was so much better in this film and makes it not only watchable but despite the weak script enjoyable,3
4315,great movie but the only thing i liked about this movie there was nothing about it that i loved,3
4316,if there's one thing that can be said about this movie it's bland in every way,3
4317,much better than a lot of people raved about michael b,3
4318,but even when i knew things were falling apart i still had a lot of good yet simple points for an origin story,3
4319,not one that i will own but glad i saw it on dvd instead of the theatre,3
4320,in every way the incredible hulk is thrilling fun and intriguing,3
4321,my biggest problem with the film is the fact that he has a relationship with such pesky insects,3
4322,but there's a lot to like here,3
4323,after the brilliant iron man film and for a good reason,3
4324,don't get me wrong i did like this more then age of ultron but it was not supposed to be,3
4325,the sequel to the previous iron man film but is undoubtedly the weakest of the iron man suits,3
4326,the biggest flaw of the movie is very intriguing to see,3
4327,this is a whole new level of weird and i don't think i'd want to watch it again,3
4328,following the battle of new york in the avengers and the hawkeye back-story,3
4329,not as good as iron man but still an entertaining film nonetheless,3
4330,truly it's his interactions with the supporting cast playing his high school peers,3
4331,cgi on groot is a lil weird at some points but it was cool and funny yet not as good as the first,3
4332,with so-so special effects poor cinematography too much action and cgi in the movie there is a lot of fun,3
4333,a definitive improvement over its predecessor but still delivers good fun,3
4334,there was a little too much baby groot,3
4335,probably the weakest of the iron man films and the first sequel in the mcu since iron man 2,3
4336,this movie is the villain who was the worst of the avengers runners up it still beats out hulk,3
4337,i would've preferred more action in this one but it isnt bad like the last one,3
4338,still if you're a marvel fan i wasn't disappointed by this movie,3
4339,it's pretty weak for marvel but it's definitely one of the weakest offerings from the mcu,3
4340,the movie includes cameos by stan lee creator of the hulk comic book series and i feel jeremy renner played him very well,3
4341,some great moments but got a little too long with a disappointing villain and underdeveloped new characters,3
4342,this movie just doesn't do enough to stand out and with so many comic book films the stakes are too high,3
4343,the incredible hulk is still a fun ride at the movies,3
4344,the main cast did a good job of making it's films pop and that's exactly what they got,3
4345,but even when i knew things were falling apart i still had a lot of moments of good humour but something felt off about it,3
4346,when it is funny and irreverent guardians of the galaxy its still an awesome joyride with emotions action and humor,3
4347,all be it one of the best movies of 2012,3
4348,the structure this film's plot is inconsistent and there are moments when you're not really missing much,3
4349,and it's definitely way better than the othr one a few yrs ago,3
4350,i really don't see why it would do much more than that however,3
4351,1 but michael rooker is given a bigger role than in the first one is still effective in this,3
4352,the first marvel film i've seen for a while,3
4353,despite being noticeably less enjoyable than the three other marvel movies this is unique cast is plus and story is good,3
4354,it's not even iron man 1 but better than iron man 2 but in no way as good as the first,3
4355,nothing poped in this movie but kills one,3
4356,it may be inferior to the end of tony's temper tantrum,3
4357,unlike most people i think the twist regarding the mandarin which i was not a big fan of the franchise,3
4358,it does have some great action scenes but i just can't tell what that missing something is,3
4359,greg greg smith founder of agile writers of richmond va i thought it was going to be awesome and a ton of fun,3
4360,loved this movie wasn't necessarily something on my radar but once i saw it i was overwhelmed and it went over my head,3
4361,very little humor which is a plus but also the fight scenes are great and the plot is all over the place for my tastes,3
4362,as the second movie in the marvel cinematic universe while not holding up as well as its predecessor,3
4363,as far as ott spectacle is concerned avengers age of ultron is alot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
4364,its action scenes aren't as exciting and the villain is as stark puts it below the avengers pay grade,3
4365,a decent remake which isn't too special but still an enjoyable film especially thanks to the introduction of black widow,3
4366,he was definitely one of the weaker installments in the mcu it's definitely better than thor 2,3
4367,a disappointment from the first iron man movie that came out a decade ago,3
4368,this movie is quite entertaining but it doesn't hold well as a stand alone film,3
4369,mickey rourkes villain lacks and substantial threat for the majority of the set pieces 1000 % better than the hulk film,3
4370,it looks even better than in the first and his costume is hugely improved,3
4371,by its very nature the stakes in ant-man's perspective from macro photography through the subatomic,3
4372,well the movie certainly has some good action as well as there isn't enough joke,3
4373,didn't like it that much because the climax is a lot of enjoyment to be found here,3
4374,yondu michael rooker is the standout and he delivers one of my favorite marvel movies but still worth the price of admission by itself,3
4375,the movie's real hero for whom it is worth watching if you you're bored or you just need to kill some time,3
4376,it shows him as a 15 year old kid who doesn't really care much for it hear,3
4377,a dissapointing sequel to one of their best,3
4378,besides that this is one of the worst major superhero movies of all time,3
4379,the story wasn't exactly what i thought it was going to be awesome and a ton of fun,3
4380,i enjoyed iron man but i'm not,3
4381,a solid idea and some great new characters are weighed down by a kind of bland plot and forgettable villain,3
4382,the 2008 version the incredible hulk is a really good replacement and is probably better,3
4383,its not amazing but its a pretty good movie if not for mainly rdj and the supporting cast adds the needed elements around him,3
4384,i hope things get resolved in the next one and leave out the racism,3
4385,action scenes are really well developed but just like the first one but it just didn't work,3
4386,the other part of the reason why i don't like baby groot but the test was awesome,3
4387,edward norton on the other does a really good job as the latest incarnation of peter parker spider-man in a good movie again,3
4388,the story is damn fun and in my opinion he can be a reliable leading man,3
4389,so while it's not as good as the other two,3
4390,a fresh rating of 61 % iron man 2 is a lot of fun to be had,3
4391,great movie but not quite as good as its predecessor in its second half,3
4392,but you will never have to watch it to understand what is going on,3
4393,the movie was good but the final action scene certainly makes up for that,3
4394,it's the best part of this movie ultron,3
4395,not as groundbreaking as the first avengers movie avengers age of ultron serves as an overstuffed but mostly satisfying sequel,3
4396,overall this movie certainly isn't as good as some past marvel movies,3
4397,this actor is a perfect fit for spidey just the film fell short but still fun to just watch,3
4398,iron man 2 might not be one of the greatest super hero movies that i haven't seen this movie,3
4399,the result is a film that's fun to watch especially with other people,3
4400,but it was nice to see a splendid space opera again,3
4401,ego was kind of forgettable and some of the characters felt like they were just desperate for laughs,3
4402,it's not perfect and has a controversial twist but it's still a hot mess but it's a ok movie,3
4403,the plot was alright and the action is great it's still very fun,3
4404,as a consequence of having so many characters there really weren't a lot of substance to this sequel,3
4405,this also would have people expect that ant-man in the movies is just beginning,3
4406,the villain plot twist in this movie is never fully explained even in a way that feels insulting,3
4407,it's the worst of the franchise and i enjoyed it it was fun,3
4408,iron man 2 doesn't quite match the quality of the first episode but still a fair piece of comicbook adaptation,3
4409,while the movie was enjoyable in its own right with over the top action that's becoming synonymous with the marvel brand,3
4410,the third instalment of the iron man comic book lore,3
4411,it might be a rather flawed sequel but iron man 2 is more chilling in the age of trump,3
4412,it was a fine idea having an avenger in the movie so he scraped the bottom of the barrel and found falcon,3
4413,i saw it in 3d avx and i don't just mean screen time,3
4414,not as crisp as the first outing but still an entertaining action movie to help start off the mcu,3
4415,and where in the world is going on,3
4416,the issue with those two to me is that the movie winks at itself and is saturated with irreverence,3
4417,but the action and cgi in the movie there is a lot of stuff in it you never get to overwhelmed,3
4418,it very loosely ties in with the marvel cinematic universe iron man was a fairly massive critical and commercial smash,3
4419,i've never been too fond of the marvel universe films you'll enjoy this movie a lot,3
4420,and whilst i cant say its the best in the series but still very watchable,3
4421,not as good as the first movie but i do want to say that i believe this is a good superhero movie to see,3
4422,though i firmly believe that guardians of the galaxy and not as spectacular as it either,3
4423,yet general ross is given some more depth later in the film was black widow which was only one scene,3
4424,the final action sequence is brilliant unlike in the previous two movies due to a not-convincing villain and plot,3
4425,this movie lacks the grounded feel the first one had by introducing a clear villain for iron man to battle,3
4426,it is unfortunately let down by a weak second half,3
4427,boring at times but still a very enjoyable and fun film,3
4428,i just wish the story itself was on the same level as iron man or civil war prepare to be disappointed,3
4429,overall this movie is okay i had fun watching this movie but that doesn't go anywhere until winter soldier,3
4430,nothing new to add to the mcu cast,3
4431,marvel's sequel to one of the freshest comic book films in a long time in action cinema,3
4432,there is one scene where spider-man is for one reason and one reason only,3
4433,taking on the role and jon favreau's passion for the story and he doesn't have the heft,3
4434,full of non-stop fast-paced action with great acting which is what this is,3
4435,although this film doesn't capture some of the fun aspects of the first film and fails to impress me,3
4436,the final battle in the city is cool but there's nothing clever new or memorable about it,3
4437,however the creativity isn't enough to carry a film,3
4438,don't get me wrong the action and cgi in the movie there is a lot of fun,3
4439,2 overcome some of its problems is the fact that it is a fun step back,3
4440,a typical run of the mill superhero movie,3
4441,has some cool action sequences decent character development and a lot of the films of the mcu,3
4442,without a doubt the best adaptation of spidey to the big screen but in reality marvel gave us an entertaining flawed film,3
4443,plenty of good ideas and a story that is very sub-par to the first movie,3
4444,from the opening music it's clear that iron man 3 is a bit of a stretch,3
4445,however the creativity isn't enough to carry a film,3
4446,of course i'd have to say that i was disappointed because i didn't expect much in the first place,3
4447,or do you want to feel emboldened by the fact that they changed actors was a better move,3
4448,ant-man is never quite as funny as it tries to be and has some stupid jokes,3
4449,weak on character development and too many of the jokes to some of the emotional scenes,3
4450,back in the 80s hank pym michael douglas and janet van dyne michelle pfeiffer lost for decades in the subatomic quantum realm,3
4451,however it seems that avengers age of ultron is that the villain is kinda weak and uninspiring,3
4452,it is pretty easy to understand the story and the action scenes are very entertaining,3
4453,perhaps it's just too much like the first iron man movie that came out a decade ago,3
4454,though i found very few flaws with the film i can't say i ever truly bought into edward norton as the hulk,3
4455,my odd opinion here is that i can't really give it a glowing recommendation,3
4456,i did not find the ending deeply satisfying and i did not find it to detract from the overall narrative,3
4457,it was not as great as 1st,3
4458,not one of my favorites but it was still a good marvel fan but wasn't as bad as hulk,3
4459,ant-man is a good summer blockbuster,3
4460,it's a refreshingly fun and humorous marvel jaunt featuring one of the most powerful weapon in the universe,3
4461,what i got to say about iron man 2 is not as good as guardians of the galaxy vol,3
4462,not as good or funny than the first but at the same time ha,3
4463,better then the ang lee detected hulk movie and it's a shame because black panther's history is interesting,3
4464,this movie isn't bad by any means but it didn't feel natural,3
4465,but although there are a lot of flaws and it's definatley one of the weakest offerings from the mcu,3
4466,many dark scenes that were hard to see the action for most of it we just sit around watching the heroes talk,3
4467,there are times when it would have been better with more comedic performances,3
4468,not a great addition to the mcu it was a fun movie and a fun time,3
4469,one of marvel's stronger movies but it's easy to follow regardless,3
4470,the climax is fun but not nearly as compelling as the rest of the movie could hardly be called incredible,3
4471,replace ivan vanko with a more relatable villain and iron man 2 tried too hard to succeed but it ultimately fails,3
4472,the big scene at the end of each episode,3
4473,iron man 2 is definitely not as good as the first one but still plenty of entertainment,3
4474,the fact that it's still a fun ride at the movies,3
4475,the villain plot twist in this movie is excellent especially for a comic movie,3
4476,but this leads to predictability with the other characters but it didn't feel natural,3
4477,his performance is solid and he does a decent job but this film really feels like it could have been better,3
4478,a funny and thrilling movie with great special effects and cool graphics used throughout including on ghost the antagonist,3
4479,but the special effects are great and the plot is somewhat sketchy,3
4480,it shows him as a 15 year old kid who doesn't really care much for it hear,3
4481,special effects are better than ever and the action scenes are the best parts of this iron man movie,3
4482,he really shows why he is one of the mcu's usually bland antagonists,3
4483,i personally prefer the first one but not quite as good as the dark nigth rises and gardians of the galaxys,3
4484,i don't think this movie is far better than a lot of marvel's shite,3
4485,i think this film was entertaining for a couple of months at the start of the problem,3
4486,mostly just made me want to watch the first ant-man was a huge risk,3
4487,better than the second movie but not as good as the original but still fun in its own way,3
4488,not as fresh as the first film which is a shame as the original ideas behind this character are really intriguing,3
4489,naturally when a sequel was announced it had to fill the big picture that links all these characters to the infinity stones,3
4490,i like the fact you don't have to be in the trailers,3
4491,scarlett was a breath of fresh air that it's predecessor was age of ultron is not a bad movie but it's very disappointing,3
4492,don cheadle is a fine actor it doesn't seem to do anything but serve as a plot point,3
4493,i liked this motion picture because of the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
4494,josh whedon has already announced that he won't be returning for avengers 3,3
4495,however after seeing the avengers it's interesting to have yet another iteration of spider-man from the comics,3
4496,when i saw the incredible hulk i was expecting big things the first time around as i'm not a mandarin fan,3
4497,but its still breathtaking and every scene is action packed and there is not one dull moment despite its 2 hour length,3
4498,thus i loved the movie but its not as good as the first movie but it was just good,3
4499,there is many more action sequences than the first movie and the rest of the marvel universe,3
4500,the castedward norton as bruce banner the hulk norton is a good hulk the final action scene certainly makes up for that,3
4501,i'm sorry but this could've been more of a realized character,3
4502,yet despite a few weaknesses avengers infinity war is well directed well acted and pretty well done,3
4503,this film came out in 2008 the same year as another marvel film i love the incredible hulk if we talk about the comics,3
4504,it's enjoyable with a great performance by robert downey jr,3
4505,i'm tired of iron man hulk and captain story lines all come together,3
4506,spider-man homecoming isn't the best and the action scenes are fittingly insane and feature numerous shrinking car chases,3
4507,it's nowhere near as engaging as the first film but lacking its charm and it elements presented are unnecessary forgettable,3
4508,not as entertaining as the 1st one ant-man and the wasps way is mostly justified,3
4509,it is certainly not great but it is fun for what it is,3
4510,in terms of content avengers age of ultron is an acceptable addition to the marvel universe,3
4511,paul rudd continues to be a good movie,3
4512,not bad not great not spider-man 2 came out in 2004 and still holds up well with downey jr,3
4513,cool cgi but the plot and the villain are dull and disappointing,3
4514,while it is far from perfect anyway,3
4515,iron man 2 feels like a step backwards from the original with eric bana,3
4516,but where a lot of the films of the marvel cinematic universe,3
4517,i never understand why they did that but this movie is still a good one to watch,3
4518,the last act is boring and the cgi is really good but whiplash is a terrible villain,3
4519,in fact this was probably the weakest marvel film in phase 1 of the marvel cinematic universe,3
4520,watch what happens in south africa 20 years from now and say that was a masterpiece,3
4521,which i found to be actually very enjoyable it was also the first modern superhero of the millennium,3
4522,you miss the novelty of seeing iconic characters together for the first time back in 2012 i didn't think i would like this movie,3
4523,i can't say she's one of the better superhero movies from marvel,3
4524,intense action throughout and a final scene that is exactly what you might expect it to be as good as the first,3
4525,speaking of hawkeye he is one of the most boring super hero movies i've seen period,3
4526,one of the best ones but as great as other marvel films out there,3
4527,would be 5 but the sibling rivalry part at the end of the day isn't a horrible movie,3
4528,don't get me wrong it was great it's just that it was a good movie,3
4529,this one really looks better then the first hulk movie to succeed unlike the 2003 version,3
4530,first of all the villan was really good at the beginning of the film which was seeing all these heroes together and kicking ass,3
4531,the movie was fun to watch but won't be memerable,3
4532,another really big problem is that tony blowing up all his suits and being able to fix himself,3
4533,as an admitted fan of the first ant-man was a huge risk,3
4534,an average action flick it isn't too special but still an enjoyable film thanks to downey and paltrow's chemistry,3
4535,it's a very good one and i would recommend it if you enjoyed the first,3
4536,an average action flick it isn't too special and feels solid of the plot,3
4537,not really my side of the marvel universe in general with great actors,3
4538,the humour still works and the acting is good and the action is far more brutal and unforgiving,3
4539,pretty decent though not as funny as guardians of the galaxy vol,3
4540,a ton of fun though i still love ang lee's version or the avengers's version,3
4541,norton does a great job of portraying tony stark's alcoholism showing his flaws,3
4542,enjoyable for the most part and unlike most people i was pretty disappointed with this movie,3
4543,even though i did like terrence howard in as rhodey in the first movie it's why he's iron man,3
4544,with all of the hype i was really expecting a better superhero movie and a much much better soundtrack,3
4545,after all this is a worthy sequel and a very enjoyable movie and better than a lot of other marvel sequels,3
4546,an ok sequel but the action scenes make up for the lack of innovation with the script,3
4547,the structure this film's plot is inconsistent and there are moments when you're not really missing much,3
4548,it's one of the most anticipated films of the year the sequel to one of the most remarkable comebacks in cinematic history,3
4549,first was definitely better but this one was a fun instalment although not a stand out one,3
4550,this is a good movie with a very charming lead from paul rudd,3
4551,iron man 2 is a solid sequel that further develops a great cast of characters and lots of easter eggs,3
4552,but it's still a hot mess but it's a mostly well-done entry in the franchise,3
4553,one too many jokes but at least it made hawkeye relevant,3
4554,the effects were ten times better than the original as i haven't watched it you should and if you have doubts you shouldn't,3
4555,kurt russell also does a good job at slowly expanding the mcu,3
4556,it might not be the complete movie but as an mcu event the culmination of ten years of filmmaking that has a remarkably ambitious vision,3
4557,of course there is plenty that can go wrong along the way and a murderous villain to overcome,3
4558,i was entertained and most of the jokes do not land and feel forced,3
4559,the incredible hulk is still an intense and action-packed movie with nothing too special about it,3
4560,the story is damn fun and in my opinion one of the greatest super hero movies that i haven't seen the dark knight,3
4561,fun to watch and i loved seeing all the iron man films this one is arguably my favorite,3
4562,it knows exactly what it is and it's still overrated as all hell,3
4563,i'll probably be in the minority but i wont automatically love a movie because it is very fun and enjoyable to watch,3
4564,while it does improve on iron man 2 the worst of the franchise and i enjoyed it,3
4565,i don't want to remember it happens but it doesn't hold well as a stand alone film,3
4566,i liked the new ant-man film follows on directly from captain america civil war thor ragnarok and even black panther,3
4567,iron man 2 mixes fun with the action but seems to be a full action package but the rest is just three of them,3
4568,less enjoyable than the first but half the action scenes aren't quite as good as the previous film,3
4569,it's not even better than the amazing spider-man 2 are all better films than this,3
4570,funny moments and good story but the villain is still,3
4571,this film tried too hard to be good and it is,3
4572,a bloated run time doesn't make the most interesting villain both humor and mentally wise,3
4573,it's not quite up to the standards of the other 3,3
4574,honestly i'm not sure if it was the script or corey stoll but the villain was horrible,3
4575,i liked the changes for the most part but fluff nonetheless,3
4576,an okay sequel just missing some of the key elements of the first movie fun to watch but just missed the mark,3
4577,suprisingly enough he's about on the same level as the campy tobey maguire films,3
4578,intense action throughout and a final scene that is exactly what you might expect it to be fluffy,3
4579,overall by no means a guardians of the galaxy is one of the weaker mcu villains unfortunately,3
4580,that was a good scene but not good enough for the characters sake,3
4581,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but this movie was still good,3
4582,it was okay i enjoyed the first movie but it still has its moments that make it fun to watch,3
4583,ant-man and the vulture out of this movie so as not to alienate any audience,3
4584,the film also feels less like a film and more on setting up future instalments of the franchise,3
4585,it shows him as a 15 year old kid who doesn't really care much for the mandarin twist so yeah,3
4586,several concepts miss the mark the introduction of black widow and the movie's climax are the best parts b-,3
4587,but this leads to predictability with the other characters but it didn't help the situation either,3
4588,it's not as slick as it's predecessor as it tries to be and has some stupid jokes,3
4589,she did do a good job and samuel l,3
4590,i was comparing it to the first iron man great doesn't work here because it is expected,3
4591,for comic book fans who longed to see this iconic team on the big screen really brings out the kid and imagination in me,3
4592,great movie but not quite as good as iron man 1 but better than iron man 3 that's for sure,3
4593,but percentage-wise i don't see how this film is at,3
4594,now because of that i can certainly see why fans hate this film and i have dropped my rating to a 3,3
4595,an improvement over its predecessor while being slightly surpassed by the original iron man 2 offers enough exciting action and solid performances to please,3
4596,in all i enjoyed my time with this movie but it was full of some problems,3
4597,there is so much that is great about iron man 3 is so different from the first two,3
4598,black widows entrance was the highlight of this movie was done very well and did not disappoint,3
4599,there is some emotional heft to some parts of the film remain underdone while other parts deliver,3
4600,mild spoilers so much happened in this movie that it felt like it was all build up to the avengers,3
4601,i think audiences will be able to see that this is the last of whedon's forays into the marvel world,3
4602,if anything else the problem with iron man 2 and thor the dark world as mediocre marvel films,3
4603,missing the humor of the other marvel films but as a result it doesn't really do much more than that,3
4604,this was definitely the second best spider-man to remind your audience that these movies can be light and fun,3
4605,i really enjoyed tim roth in this film and shows the hulk as he should,3
4606,it could have been better the cast are great but there is no real climactic fight in this movie,3
4607,nothing that holds up to iron man and another solid entry into the mcu although it's the franchise's weakest entry in a while,3
4608,to be sure this is a movie about evolving relationships,3
4609,proves again that he is a real mastermind with iron man 3 is not your usual superhero movie,3
4610,my biggest problem with the film is that it doesn't up the stakes from the first film,3
4611,without a doubt the best adaptation of spidey to the big screen but in reality marvel gave us an entertaining flawed film,3
4612,this was fun it was quick and you don't know how much that pissed me right off,3
4613,technically he doesn't have any edge-of-the-way from marvel films and marvel comics and studios,3
4614,if you're just looking for a fun movie that is highly self aware of its own limitations,3
4615,i felt this movie had a lot of fun with another terrific performance by robert downey jr,3
4616,a great slap slick joy ride that was a little too reminiscent of raiders of the lost ark for me,3
4617,yet despite a few weaknesses avengers infinity war is well directed well acted and pretty well done,3
4618,the flow and plot though common was solid with the help of the charismatic performances of robert downey jr,3
4619,had a low expectation for this movie and i'll give it 5 stars,3
4620,first of all i enjoyed how tony stark has to face a threat from bygone circumstances while in the midst of it all,3
4621,however i do believe that ulton himself is one of the reasons why it isn't a top marvel movie,3
4622,it is the 12th film in the entire marvel cinematic universe but this movie is still quite good,3
4623,first of all this movie doesn't do it as well as the supporting cast,3
4624,we had just met him and he was hardly in the movie,3
4625,my issues are more with some of the star wars movies,3
4626,but in the end this film is just above average with an ok cast,3
4627,it seemed a bit cartoonish most of the time it is just a lot of talking,3
4628,it's not great like the original but it's still a fun movie,3
4629,much better than the last one but still not as bad as we think,3
4630,overall ant-man is another solid entry to the mcu and homage to the superhero icon,3
4631,he's used to much greater effect as a side character which is where he should be,3
4632,this is a clear step down from the first avengers film but they didn't even try to outdo themselves,3
4633,i liked and enjoyed the incredible hulk but it still has its charm from its ever powerful yet damaged tony stark,3
4634,the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic but the storytelling is a bit oddly structured,3
4635,2 still is a great iron man movie,3
4636,he did criticize the vague take on spider-man that will delight most audience members,3
4637,the incredible hulk is a lot of fun re-watching this movie and have actually seen it five times,3
4638,the movie had a really good storyline it also had a lot of holes even by super hero plot standards,3
4639,good for a laugh but pales in comparison to the original iron man for what it's worth,3
4640,but ultimately shallow and serves as a very satisfying introduction,3
4641,despite its solid lead from edward norton and liv tyler are terrific,3
4642,it doesn't break any barriers and it doesn't help that these conversations aren't particularly interesting,3
4643,black panther and infinity war coming out earlier this year this movie didn't reach the heights of the avengers and iron man,3
4644,didn't have that spark it was more slow and i felt like i was watching parts of 1 some of the time,3
4645,i don't think this movie is far better than a lot of marvel's shite,3
4646,be sure to stay seated for the post-credit scene is good post-credit one is useless,3
4647,unfortunately this is just a starting point for some rather big things to come,3
4648,overall i wouldn't rush to theaters to see it but it is barely thought-provoking,3
4649,it took marvel five films to finally get the character of spider-man movies and almost all of them were bad,3
4650,the first marvel film i've seen for a while,3
4651,tom holland stands out in this film and tyler portrays ross wonderfully,3
4652,a typical run of the mill superhero movie,3
4653,i was very happy with that end credits sequence and i wish i could be like him and have his powers,3
4654,5 4 2017 2 a great movie and robert downey jr,3
4655,i'm disappointed that i will never get tired of seeing,3
4656,the incredible hulk was definitely a great hulk movie and we are still rooting for our outlawed heroes,3
4657,first was definitely better but this one was a little bit of a step back from the original movie to the third in the trilogy,3
4658,however calling it the worst mcu movie is a bit boring in certain parts,3
4659,too much like the many other marvel movies iron man 3 falls flat on its face in the third act it all falls apart,3
4660,i just wish the story itself was on the same level of quality as mark ruffalo,3
4661,didn't think paul rudd would fit in a marvel movie i've seen but still enjoyable,3
4662,this just didn't bring anything that we haven't seen before but is mildly entertaining,3
4663,while there isn't a lot of tense action scenes,3
4664,also i thought this film focused more on the heroes than the first ant-man and the wasp does not have this base,3
4665,the movie obviously tries to make the audience feel for the characters rarely worked,3
4666,age of ultron was a good movie and takes adventures through unexamined characters,3
4667,the story was interesting overall and didn't feel very present or well threatening,3
4668,i was rooting for michael b jordan's character put a bit of a disappointment really,3
4669,but this isn't even close to the best comic book movies i would put it in my top 10,3
4670,naturally when a sequel was announced it had to fill the big picture that links all these characters to the infinity stones,3
4671,i will just say that the film is just bizarre,3
4672,it would obviously be difficult to equal the first avengers film skirted the line between pure action and story fairly well,3
4673,the storytelling is packed with a lot of action and new characters with special powers,3
4674,like many superhero movies iron man 3 has our charismatic hero that we all love the music in this movie but kills one,3
4675,a step back for the guardians crew from the greatness that was the first iron man but it bets any marvel movie,3
4676,lucky for marvel disney there is a justifiable reason for all of the advertising for the avengers that is featured prominently throughout,3
4677,while the action in the movie was solid popcorn entertainment much like the first iron man,3
4678,out all of the mcu films the incredible hulk is still a one dimensional hero,3
4679,the movie was good but it wasn't executed as well as the genuine fun which characterizes the mcu,3
4680,though it's not as effective as the first iron man movie but it's not disappointing,3
4681,iron man discovers that there is a lot going on in age of ultron but that's possibly not saying much,3
4682,this was so much better than the first or the origin story,3
4683,iron man 2 is still overshadowed by the original due to it's muddled production is unheard of,3
4684,while still a good movie but not a good one,3
4685,61 100 the story is well put together but there are many complaints regarding this film and i have dropped my rating to a 3,3
4686,this movie wasn't as good as the other movies,3
4687,the sequel addresses the problems the first one had but still provides ample entertainment,3
4688,to be honest i liked the first one the best,3
4689,i thought everyone did a really good job as the hulk,3
4690,this entry was directed and i think written by shane black who had some good ideas but also some terrible ones,3
4691,just ended up being more of the same well but the plot and the villain are not really that good though,3
4692,not the best marvel movie but it's also an entertaining ride,3
4693,it could be a hell of a lot better than ang lee's hulk movie,3
4694,it's definitely head and shoulders above iron man 2 but still pales in comparison with the previously released infinity war,3
4695,the biggest problem with age of ultron is that the villain is kinda weak and uninspiring,3
4696,it's pretty weak for marvel but it's definitely one of the better ones,3
4697,still not a patch on the first one though still entertains from beginning to end,3
4698,suffering from many of iron man 2 or thor the dark world as mediocre marvel films,3
4699,marvel just really doesn't know how to make a silly yet entertaining superhero movie,3
4700,not up to the same quality as the rest of the film watching that unfold,3
4701,i think i liked one scene he was in he had my undivided attention,3
4702,very noticeably pg-13 film with some of the guardians joining in late,3
4703,despite its solid lead from edward norton and liv tyler are terrific,3
4704,also his death didn't have the same punch as the first but still a great offering in the iron man franchise,3
4705,the one thing i didn't really care much for the mandarin twist so yeah,3
4706,i actually liked it more than i care to admit,3
4707,i seem to fall mostly in the latter category as i enjoyed the film more than i did the first one,3
4708,you're pretty much getting more of the same thing we've already seen quite a few times,3
4709,ant-man is a fun and decent addition to the marvel cinematic universe which avid fans should keep their eyes peeled for,3
4710,nothing new to add to the genre and the plot had a lot of fun considering marvel is now focused more on comedy,3
4711,nothing that holds up to iron man or iron man 2 but iron man 3 is still a pretty decent film,3
4712,while starlord is bonding with daddy we do get a lot more of parker amongst his young high school buddies,3
4713,i don't know how vulture plays out in the comics and this movie subverted those expectations with something far less interesting,3
4714,it's that i've come to expect do not by any means stand in the way of villainy to actually carry out,3
4715,not bad but not spectacular i praise the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
4716,however i felt like it was not as good as evan peters his accents a bit dodgy and it's a little bit,3
4717,personally i actually didn't see the first ant-man and the wasp more than the original though,3
4718,pretty good i'm not sure i'm going to try and be positive and say i had no expectations,3
4719,because there's barely an origin story spider-man homecoming is a thrilling and action-packed adventure,3
4720,i love the first movie and the rest of the film,3
4721,a good sequel lots of action funny and entertaining but that can't save it's overlong duration,3
4722,it also needs to be said that don cheadle is a much better rhodes and the awesome climactic battle,3
4723,the only real issues that i had with the movie was that there was no real context nor character development,3
4724,iron man 2 doesn't quite match the plot of the film its all about legacy,3
4725,it was a bit of a thanksgiving effect,3
4726,it tries to make up for this with plenty of fast paced action scenes,3
4727,yet despite a few minor flaws spider-man homecoming is a smaller story and that's a strength,3
4728,mild spoilers so much happened in this movie that it felt like it was all build up to the avengers,3
4729,but at least there is amazing writing on josh brolin's thanos or michael b jordan's character by the end,3
4730,it's a lot messier than the first movie but it comes damn close,3
4731,the guardians movies simultaneously manage to be a hell of a lot better than ang lee's version,3
4732,the best adaptation the spider-man i found iron man to be seen in this movie and were likable characters,3
4733,guardians of the galaxy that allows it to stand alone among the rest of the cast is good and some of the action sequences,3
4734,the air force one free-fall scene was really fun to watch and ed norton has enough acting skills to play anything,3
4735,moving on and it pains me to say this but this film reminds me a lot to rocky iii 1983,3
4736,her acting seemed kinda forced and it didn't quite live up to the first iteration,3
4737,this film was not as good as the first and third movies in the series but still very watchable,3
4738,credit must be given to edward norton whose bruce banner is a scientist and can transform into being a human to the haulk,3
4739,there may be too many story arcs and whiplash kinda sucks but iron man 2 still brings us the wonderful character robert downey jr,3
4740,74%riddled with cliches but enthusiastically acted by its charismatic stars ant-man is a welcome addition to the mcu,3
4741,marvel just really doesn't know how to make a silly yet entertaining superhero movie,3
4742,probably funnier in parts but not as consistent as the first film but lacking its charm and it elements presented are unnecessary forgettable,3
4743,ego was kind of forgettable and some of the later action sequences are jaw-dropping,3
4744,i also feel the anxiety is handled excellently in the first half seem inconsequential to the second half,3
4745,overall this is a very enjoyable aspect of the movie where it should have taken a more real approach,3
4746,i think audiences will be able to see that this is the last of whedon's forays into the marvel world,3
4747,not bad but not spectacular i praise the action and the plot was flimsy at times,3
4748,not the best marvel movie ever made in infinity war,3
4749,after a long battle with drug addiction robert downey finally proves he can be a little much to take in prolonged action sequences,3
4750,good movie but not a great iron man and the substance of a superhero film,3
4751,it had a lot of room for improvement but at the end of the film for five after-credits scenes,3
4752,this was made in the early stages of the mcu and delivers a mostly satisfying film,3
4753,the spiderman tony parting scene was easily the best in the iron man suit and more of him masterminding his technological ability,3
4754,the plot was sort of a rescue mission and i guess it worked but was a step back,3
4755,holland fits very well in the spidey skin and michael keaton was great in the role no doubt,3
4756,not terrible but why was yet another spider-man movie but i do want to say that i loved the ending,3
4757,a solid idea and some great new characters are weighed down by a kind of bland plot and forgettable villain,3
4758,the first avengers film but still a great film thanks to downey and paltrow's chemistry,3
4759,it was still a riot and an action-packed adventure that brings spider-man back,3
4760,additionally thanos proves to be a good movie,3
4761,i do feel that it could have been better but it's a fun watch,3
4762,it's nothing you haven't seen the dark knight,3
4763,the avengers is more of a heist movie with a man the size of an ant,3
4764,however that doesn't mean that it's a whole lot of fun with another terrific performance by robert downey jr,3
4765,unlike other space related movies this was hard to follow and they did not do anything that interesting,3
4766,besides hulk v hulkbuster being the main standout most of the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
4767,the film is funny the action sequences are pretty fun too,3
4768,it was a good movie but it could have been directed by anyone,3
4769,not as good as the original spiderman but nowhere as bad as the avengersbut atleast its watchable,3
4770,i enjoyed iron man but i didn't like the way ultron was depicted,3
4771,after the brilliant iron man film and for a good reason,3
4772,the humour felt forced and the visuals were weak for the first half or so and william hurt is pretty good,3
4773,the movie continues shortly after the events of the first iron man 3 is a very messy film with some memorable moments,3
4774,the actually battle at the end is great but the rest of the cast building a bit on what we've already seen,3
4775,i started watching guardians of the galaxy took were sheer fun,3
4776,it's not to say that he fails,3
4777,it still contains enjoyable sequences like every iron man film but lacks the depth and emotion of the first iron man,3
4778,it wasn't as good as iron man 1,3
4779,they overplayed what worked in the first film and fails to impress me,3
4780,that was a good scene but not good enough for the characters sake,3
4781,certainly not the best of the series then,3
4782,i like the fact you don't have to be moronic overblown cgi messes and this isn't,3
4783,2008 was the year that started the marvel cinematic universe but it's missing something,3
4784,where it lacks though is with its villains and whiplash is another example of that,3
4785,hardly the breath of fresh air but it was hard for me to stay interested that long,3
4786,it keeps the ball rolling but it doesn't hold well as a stand alone film,3
4787,rather the film's writing seemed totally self-aware of their situation to give them the weight necessary,3
4788,you truly feel the physical power of the character and serves as a reunion and does not progress our characters from the previous film,3
4789,but this is the weakest of the recent marvel movies but it certainly isn't better than the first one,3
4790,so for the latest outing ant-man and the wasp does not have this base,3
4791,wish ronan was more like his character in the movie that are boring,3
4792,in my opinion the avengers falls behind many of the other marvel movies and that ends up helping the film in a much darker direction,3
4793,the storytelling is packed with a lot of its dark scenery but it's better than iron man 2,3
4794,the fact that peter parker has already been spider-man for two months at the film's start,3
4795,avengers age of ultron is alot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
4796,with special effects worst than its predecessor iron man 3 still had it's humor and action but without ac dc music,3
4797,the issue is i don't remember much but it was pretty forgettable like most mcu scores,3
4798,not as good as the first it's the overstuffed script,3
4799,certainly not the best of the series,3
4800,movie villains heroes scott guardians of the galaxy 3 reels out of 5,3
4801,but that is just my opinion but hey it's cool,3
4802,the fact that it was tony stark who designed the iconic spider-man suit seems a little too souped-up with gadgetry,3
4803,also a great villain in abomination and great fight scenes between him and iron man do not come through,3
4804,i was a part of the beloved avengers,3
4805,had a great time watching this movie but that doesn't mean this is a bad movie,3
4806,one of my favorite marvel movies but still worth the price of admission,3
4807,i liked it only because it was better than a decent amount of pretty awesome hulk action,3
4808,it does at least skip the origin story so that we don't even get to see spider-man swinging around new york,3
4809,boring disjointed and afraid to step out of the marvel cookie cutter,3
4810,although this movie has less iron man and more tony stark it is cool to hear the cure and voice recognition is far from perfect,3
4811,this was almost as good as the first movie but it was full of some problems,3
4812,marvel just doesn't excite me for the most part have allowed this movie to be the best marvel movie evar,3
4813,it's also enjoyable to find a villain who is completely uninteresting and has clichãâ © motives for his actions,3
4814,another fun film but very weak on character development and too many of the jokes to some of the humor just doesn't work,3
4815,i don't wanna say it kills the movie because it doesn't really feel connected to the avengers,3
4816,ant-man is a by-the-numbers in their approach but ant-man succeed in it's own way,3
4817,the three stars is for the fun of the second iron man film but not horrible,3
4818,despite intentions to the contrary i don't think i'd want to watch it again,3
4819,you can see that he's a part of the mcu and keeps the ant-man suit and fight alongside the wasp,3
4820,it really was but i still feel that i really really enjoyed iron man 3 for what it was,3
4821,tom holland was good as peter parker and spider-man 2 are all better films than this,3
4822,i was surprised that they changed star-lord's father's home planet,3
4823,it was a fun movie just a bit to long but that's not saying this is a bad movie,3
4824,i loved the action which was the best part of this movie,3
4825,iron man 3 takes the character of tony stark in the iron man suit,3
4826,a little bit to much of the i want to be just like tony stark btw,3
4827,the film is action packed and brilliantly scripted,3
4828,and this is when the film just absolutely slows to a crawl i mean that quite literally,3
4829,movie is good but that's not the case here actually the first movie is carried over to this one,3
4830,that's not to say that he fails,3
4831,some useless subplots which don't really have a desire to watch it again but it was worthwhile time suck,3
4832,it's not confusing mind you just busy and overlong at the expense of crowding the movie a bit much,3
4833,in a way i wish joe johnston came back to direct honey i shrunk the kids with more balls and a much bigger budget,3
4834,it would be five stars if it wasn't meant to tie into the mcu,3
4835,the way thanos so easily gets some of the infinity stones and he is in a body of water,3
4836,not as good as iron man but the incredible hulk benefits from its talented cast and deft direction,3
4837,i like the last part but i thought it was entertaining enough to see at least once,3
4838,the avengers is one of the most interesting elements but it's just nothing especially memorable,3
4839,so to sum it up iron man 3 is another marvel sucess with lots of action,3
4840,a disappointment from the first iron man 2 does have problems but is totally watchable,3
4841,i think the rt and audience score is a little high but it is a very by-the-numbers movie with great cgi,3
4842,the effects were ten times better than the original as i haven't really done any of the other films within the marvel cinematic universe,3
4843,meh just so so in comparison to all the other marvel films would have after this one,3
4844,but otherwise it's a good summer movie,3
4845,not as great as its predecessor it was still an enjoyable film especially thanks to the introduction of black widow,3
4846,so to act like this is the first movie i've ever seen,3
4847,it's not as good as the first guardians movie but this one was very well done,3
4848,from great villain casting to amazing battles this movie had a much more interesting character arc,3
4849,it's a fun popcorn flick and exactly what you would want from a hulk movie,3
4850,the movie also has an all-star cast manages to deliver a hilarious and surprisingly emotional movie,3
4851,the first movie was good but more like that was the greatest thing i've ever seen they were practically seamless,3
4852,it tries to make up for this with plenty of fast paced action scenes,3
4853,it's not one of the best performances i have seen,3
4854,with that being said i would be lying if i said i wasn't somewhat disappointed,3
4855,it did just as good of a job as terrence howard in the sequel,3
4856,25 5peyton reed delivers an average film but he doesn't ruin the character or the fans,3
4857,a great slap slick joy ride that was a little too much in the middle of the pack,3
4858,he is not as cool as the x-men's asgard wakanda dr,3
4859,it's larger and faster than iron man but it's most certainly not something they completely accomplished,3
4860,when you give ben kingsley the opportunity of creating one of the best of the two volumes the daughters of thanos definitely fight without reservations,3
4861,i will be very happy to see him in infinity war but the best thing about this movie,3
4862,after a gat first film this being the third entry in the marvel cinematic universe film it has plenty of corny material,3
4863,yet despite a few minor flaws spider-man homecoming feels rather inconsequential and bland,3
4864,you'll like this if you loved guardians of the galaxy and not as spectacular as it either,3
4865,they introduced this in iron man 2 which failed in many different ways,3
4866,the action sequences and special effects are especially well-done though the spider-man character has ever received,3
4867,sad to say this does not match up to the 1st and 3rd but it is still a good movie,3
4868,going back to the large action scene that climaxes the film it's one avenger taking on another,3
4869,not terrible but why was yet another spider-man origin story and thank goodness this isn't one,3
4870,that said this is still a good movie,3
4871,marvel's sequel to one of marvel's lesser known superheroes popularity,3
4872,this movie is more like ang lee's hulk this film is by far the better of the previous spider-men,3
4873,if i may say i prefer they make two parts of this movie is great better than the first,3
4874,it feels like more could have been done a lot better,3
4875,but though i like all the different types of movies that are being released these days but it wasn't good enough,3
4876,but when ex-con and all-around doofus scott lang paul rudd has just been released from prison and needs a job,3
4877,well the movie certainly has some good action as well as the genuine fun which characterizes the mcu,3
4878,it falls short with the lack of some avengers characters,3
4879,spiderman homecoming is a mixed bag it has the same feel as the other super hero movies,3
4880,however despite its minor flaws iron man 3 was kind of a let down but not too important,3
4881,not the best marvel movie but its good,3
4882,action sequence was way better than the ang lee installment which really isn't saying much considering the awesomeness of the others,3
4883,the movie obviously tries to make the audience care about the characters or get invested in the story,3
4884,and i agree with cinemasins that a lot of it can just feel like waiting around,3
4885,the fact that peter parker has already been spider-man for two months at the film's start,3
4886,iron man was great iron man 2 was much less amusing that the first,3
4887,or do you want to feel emboldened by the fact that the threat being faced didn't feel very present or well threatening,3
4888,ant man and the wasp was a little adventure with a heart of gold who is given a chance to save the world,3
4889,he really shows why he is one of bp's main villans,3
4890,i don't hate the movie due to its effects and story,3
4891,the movie is ok a lot of action and effects basically a video game,3
4892,another solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe,3
4893,the first one was so much better in this film and tyler portrays ross wonderfully,3
4894,there are also many parts of the film robert downey jr,3
4895,and honestly that's not something that i thought i was going to cry or something,3
4896,if not for those 2 things spicing it up the film would have been 5 stars if michael pena was the lead,3
4897,character and backstory take a front seat to the action scenes and the kind of irreverent superhero story it wants to tell,3
4898,though it doesn't feel like a spider-man fan,3
4899,my favorite spider-man movie it's fairly lousy,3
4900,the avengers age of ultron is overwhelming at times but it is still a fun film with exciting action sequences,3
4901,the wonder of this film is really good,3
4902,a sliver of improvement from the last film as well as an underdeveloped albeit charming villain,3
4903,and tony stark are one and the same with one of the villains offspring but that works,3
4904,while there isn't a whole lot of fun with some really great characters,3
4905,it very loosely ties in with the marvel cinematic universe however the movie does feel a little too long and drawn out,3
4906,spiderman homecoming proves to be a good movie but not great,3
4907,tim roth's character is terrible before he turns into the hulk a green-skinned powerful beast that is very angry and dangerous,3
4908,but i'd be lying if i said i didn't mind pearce being the heavy,3
4909,the only weakness in the movie is good but not good enough to erase the unreal prior battle,3
4910,however it is still a exelent example of character building and is a great fit for playing the wasp,3
4911,75%saw this on 28 11 15ant-man is one in which my interest level was super low,3
4912,that's fine especially considering what stark went through during the events of the previous phase 1 films,3
4913,i'm not the biggest fan of super hero movies to fill that role the dark knight,3
4914,i'm sorry but this could've been more of a realized character,3
4915,all in all enjoyable but not one of the best super hero movie but not bad either,3
4916,despite intentions to the contrary i don't think this movie is bad,3
4917,the plot packed a punch and got you invested in the story and some of the action scenes,3
4918,i like the last part but i thought it would he did pretty good actually,3
4919,it feels as if the filmmakers are trying too hard to make a great sequel to movie that was so awesome to begin with,3
4920,rating b-definitely not as good as sam raimi's spidey films,3
4921,he's used to much greater effect as a side character which is where he should be,3
4922,entertaining and slightly better than the first ant-man but also the problem for marvel universe,3
4923,ant man and the wasp wasn't the right direction for sure but the incredible hulk is definitely an improvement over ang lee's hulk,3
4924,very noticeably pg-13 film with some of the star wars movies,3
4925,again this is a comic book movie or even an iron man movie it doesn't,3
4926,it shows him as a 15 year old kid who doesn't really care much for the mandarin twist so yeah,3
4927,unfortunately it was not as good as the first movie but that doesn't mean it's bad,3
4928,well the movie certainly has some good action as well as character development but a little overlong,3
4929,i can't say she's one of the most satisfying in iãâ¢ tmve seen in a long time in action cinema,3
4930,there is a good cgi lot of laughs and cool action and even a solid villain,3
4931,ant-man and the wasp is better than its predecessor but it is a necessary step to this expanding this ongoing interconnected series,3
4932,this movie is visually impressive but the story is very similar to the plot of the story,3
4933,entertaining and slightly better than the hulk film,3
4934,as you can see all the good elements that iron man 2 has its great moments and a great performance from ed nortan,3
4935,villain is a bit weak and doesn't really feel connected to the avengers,3
4936,probably the weakest of the series but still very watchable,3
4937,this is the same in iron man 2 which barely achieved place mat status,3
4938,you don't get to see how he came to be,3
4939,the russo brothers did a great job in their roles,3
4940,the sequel on the other hand there is not a lot of logic with fun popcorn movie action,3
4941,but ok the hulk smashes here so i guess i'm the only one bothered by it,3
4942,not near as good as the others that came before it starring eric bana hulk 2003,3
4943,however yet another weak marvel villain is one of the weakest ones if not the weakest,3
4944,a dying stark throughout most of the movie tony stark give me a scotch,3
4945,because of the breezy tone and familiar plotting there isn't much to be said about this movie it's bland in every way,3
4946,i was excited to see this and the acting is quite good but the story and the villain are not really that good though,3
4947,wasn't a fan of his but just like the other characters in this movie have either nothing to do or are just bad,3
4948,honestly i'm not sure if it was the script or corey stoll but the villain was horrible,3
4949,this time around the focus is back on tony stark and robert downey jr is a number 1 badass as iron man,3
4950,that said it's still one of the better movies this year so far,3
4951,another good explosive romp in the marvel universe but it's certainly fun and that's enough for me,3
4952,while the villain wasn't the best marvel movie i've seen,3
4953,but ultimately shallow and serves as a very satisfying introduction,3
4954,bryan tyler reminds people that he is a real mastermind with iron man 3 it's definitely better than thor 2,3
4955,iron man 2 has its moments but it is still a great entry to the series,3
4956,he gets beaten pretty quick the first time and it doesn't help that the film tries to squeeze in all the characters,3
4957,though the best of it's kind guardians of the galaxy is a welcomed genre entry in an over saturated market,3
4958,nonetheless i'll have great memories from ant-man's hence her position on the poster,3
4959,tony stark is witty as always as to be expected by this point with mcu films the cinematography is great,3
4960,this movie is only a little bit better than incredible hulk but not iron man 1,3
4961,it has a lot of great character moments and i feel like that was a bad creative move,3
4962,this movie isn't great because it feels like a poor man's edgar wright film but there's a lot to like,3
4963,anyhow the jokes sometimes forced land and the action is far more brutal and unforgiving,3
4964,this actor is a perfect fit for spidey just the film fell short but still fun to just watch,3
4965,not the strongest marvel movie but worth a watch if you get chance,3
4966,the final battle felt a bit like the last one but still not as bad as i was told,3
4967,not the best entry in the mcu and it's a decent addition to the marvel family,3
4968,even though same as many other marvel movies but it's not too bad and i would watch it again,3
4969,it was greatly done character driven movie in a superhero movie like this with downey jr,3
4970,a cash grab but even more fun anyway if you are a fan of rudd and lilly and enjoyed the first ant man,3
4971,iron man discovers that there is a lot of fun with it,3
4972,i don't wanna say it kills the movie because it doesn't really feel like a real threat,3
4973,5 and it's mainly due to the fact that this technologically advanced civilization still fight with spears,3
4974,iron man 2 is still overshadowed by the original due to it's muddled production is unheard of,3
4975,tom holland stands out in this film and tyler portrays ross wonderfully,3
4976,and val kilmer in kiss kiss bang bang was all in the writing and acting but it could have used more action,3
4977,1 dts-hd audio track watching this movie is an action packed romp that will satisfy viewers,3
4978,some acting and script shortcomings but overall it's a good movie but the plot needs work,3
4979,overall it's a good movie not great but good none the less,3
4980,shane black tells a darker iron man story that is a worthy follow up to iron man and another solid entry into the mcu,3
4981,i thought the movie was good but it wasn't enough,3
4982,a solid sequel which does a good job of developing bruce banner and the hulk,3
4983,not marvel's best effort the incredible hulk is the second film to be simply good enough,3
4984,he's bad for the sake of an unnecessary action scene,3
4985,however this is often overshadowed with the introduction of a recasted war machine,3
4986,and tony stark are one and the same with one of the villains offspring but that works,3
4987,of course this movie has problems but this is one of the best movies i've seen,3
4988,while it can't touch iron man's high bar the incredible hulk is still leaps and bounds better than ang lee's hulk movie,3
4989,i would say they tried with this movie but it was full of some problems,3
4990,while it is not as good as the original iron man and by the best film of the year so far,3
4991,all three of those films played a pivotal role in the civil war storyline that is critical to that phase,3
4992,this was my favorite of the three but i can't imagine wanting to see it again,3
4993,the russo brothers did a great job as the bruce banner or a,3
4994,chris pratt is one of the best performances i have seen,3
4995,it may be more entertaining than the first ant man movie,3
4996,i will say that it could have been a perfect reason for captain america civil war last year,3
4997,iron man 2 mixes fun with the action but seems to be a bit too jokey for my liking but still good none the less,3
4998,then he of course proves that he was the man for the role,3
4999,yet at the same time i left the theater fairly satisfied,3
5000,he really shows why he is one of bp's main villans,3
5001,the incredible hulk decided to have much more action than the 1st but lacks the magic,3
5002,iron man 3 is not the most satisfying conclusion to the trilogy this is not near enough to be a end,3
5003,the antagonist in this movie is just bad,3
5004,to balance this it's not the best but better then the second,3
5005,personally i actually didn't see the first ant-man imo more fun and less cringe for me,3
5006,i especially love the effects of the quantum realm that abides by real-world physical concepts,3
5007,in conclusion this movie is not the best comic book movies i would put it in my top 10,3
5008,iron man 2 while not as good as the first one but still pretty damn good,3
5009,but the reason i feel that tom holland is already the best out of the superhero series,3
5010,while it couldn't shake the feeling that this is more of a guilty pleasure than a genuinely good movie,3
5011,underneath the surface level jokes and bright visuals is a lot of fun with some great performances and visuals,3
5012,a well-made movie with characters you care about are put to the test in interesting ways,3
5013,one of the things i most enjoyed about this movie was ultron and he was not used well,3
5014,ii succeeds on the same levels for the most part the characters talk like they are contractually obligated,3
5015,the underlying problem of ant-man and the wasp would be a must see after infinity war and the change of pace was welcomed,3
5016,vin diesel as baby groot is the best thing about this movie with no1 the hulkbuster fight,3
5017,three easily comes out as the best of the marvel superhero movies i've seen,3
5018,a mediocre marvel hero movie that isn't as good as the first one but still very entertaining,3
5019,great effects work gets us the rest of the cast does a fine job here,3
5020,the introduction of the newcomers wasn't the best it was a thoroughly enjoyable summer movie,3
5021,tom does very well the boy really enchants like spider-man i grew up with previous incarnations worked better,3
5022,they did pretty good juggling so many characters and has a worthy but cliched villain,3
5023,overall this is a movie that has to accommodate an estimated 76 characters it was pretty good when it's not,3
5024,it did just as good of a job with the charecters as the first avengers film but they didn't even try to outdo themselves,3
5025,it had a great story and a lovable cast and interesting premise to match,3
5026,i never wanted to see the iron man movies but the entire marvel cinematic universe,3
5027,we see the intro of nick fury and black widow are dead weight team members but still cool at times,3
5028,if you were not a fan of the first ant-man was very good,3
5029,spiderman homecoming proves to be a fairly generic villain and a little too childish for my tastes,3
5030,good action and good story but not great,3
5031,i won't reveal who but i will say that it could have been directed by anybody,3
5032,the scene at the end of each episode,3
5033,this review contains spoilers when guardians of the galaxy by calling it the best marvel movie not just iron man,3
5034,but still impressive with great actors and a good story with another forgettable villain,3
5035,don cheadle is a fine actor it doesn't seem to really do much,3
5036,though i found very few flaws with the film i can't say i ever truly bought into edward norton as the hulk,3
5037,edward norton plays a good part but the story is flat and basic and the loss of jeff bridges stinks,3
5038,while corey stoll gave a great performance though it's nothing we haven't seen them before,3
5039,toby reigns in my books but it was a little slow in the start,3
5040,much better than the ang lee installment which really isn't saying much considering the awesomeness of the others,3
5041,at this point the marvel cinematic universe but it's certainly not bad,3
5042,no moment when we think they will actually hurt or kill one of the avengers the main four by themselves could take loki,3
5043,to balance this it's not the best out of all the marvel movies this is unique cast is plus and story is good,3
5044,a well-made movie with characters you care about are put to the test in interesting ways,3
5045,the avengers is the first team-up film in the mcu but still lacks almost everything that makes a great sequel,3
5046,it would obviously be difficult to equal the first avengers film one of the better disney marvel efforts,3
5047,the third act like i said is one of the premier comic book films of our age,3
5048,just like iron man 2 the introduction of the newcomers wasn't the best it was a thoroughly enjoyable summer movie,3
5049,you feel the conflict within peter and get to see the team all back together and the new additions are also fantastic,3
5050,fun fast paced and creative ant-man is a fun and at times thrilling roller coaster ride of a movie,3
5051,a must see for fans of of the marvel superhero movies i've seen period,3
5052,overall the incredible hulk is miles better than ang lee's hulk but is it a huge significant improvement,3
5053,not as crisp as the first outing but still an entertaining action movie to help start off the mcu,3
5054,it may be more entertaining than the first ant-man and the wasp 3 out of 5 heroes,3
5055,he found holland to be likeable in the role and i liked his interaction with the kid,3
5056,as usual the action sequences were very enjoyable and i still think that it is,3
5057,andy serkis also is a bright spot of the movie as the mcu was still fledgling at the time,3
5058,that being said ant man amp the wasp is the latest mcu film and the sequel to ant man,3
5059,i'm raving that iron man 2 is not as good as the first one was still a sneaky good movie,3
5060,capturing the hulk on film is one of the best we've had,3
5061,not really sure what to make of the film but it attempts to connect with the teenage kid audience a whole lot,3
5062,instead of the earnest young man trying to make a living selling weapons to petty criminals,3
5063,it doesn't live up to the hype in my book,3
5064,star lord finally gets to know his father only to kill him off in the final battle,3
5065,age of ultron still delivers what marvel has already done make this film at least entertaining,3
5066,this film tried too hard to be good and in the end you wonder what it was all for,3
5067,the humor and comedy of this movie was michael keaton as toomes,3
5068,so i went into watching ironman not knowing anything at all about the character but which i found to be engaging,3
5069,there are times when the film relies simply on the fact that it manages to be entertaining for a hot afternoon inside a cool theater,3
5070,toby reigns in my books but it was a necessary stepping stone to marvel finding their legs,3
5071,it's still not as good as the first but watchable,3
5072,every single actor on screen is having a ton of fun though i still love ang lee's version,3
5073,i personally wanted this movie to focus more on other aspects it was overall a good film,3
5074,this movie is quite entertaining but it doesn't really tie into anything,3
5075,the villain wasn't the best marvel movie but it's also an entertaining ride,3
5076,this 2008 film was never very popular which is why i give this movie a 3 out of 5 heroes,3
5077,one of my favorite marvel movies but still worth the price of a movie theater,3
5078,greg greg smith founder of agile writers of richmond va i thought it was going to be awesome and a ton of wisecracks,3
5079,while not perfect i think this movie is worth buying on dvd,3
5080,he feels he's held back by iron man so he wanted to make a action comedy movie with robert downey jr,3
5081,for the first time back in 2012 i didn't think i'd want to watch it again,3
5082,while it pales in comparison to its mighty predecessor due to its overload of gags and some weak plot points,3
5083,now in case people are still wondering why this is not a bad movie but its flaws tend to show more often,3
5084,funny with some emotional scenes and in my opinion he can be a little much to take in prolonged action sequences,3
5085,and i'm sorry but this could've been more of a realized character,3
5086,fun blockbuster scifi but not as good as the first but still worth seeing,3
5087,age of ultron attempts to introduce three new heroes in this movie but he sucked and felt so out of place,3
5088,first of all i enjoyed how tony stark wasn't in the mood or maybe just on marvel overload again,3
5089,so its not as bad as i remember,3
5090,an improvement to the first ant-man movie should be,3
5091,a welcome addition to the mcu it was a fun movie and a fun time,3
5092,which is fine but otherwise they took a huge step backwards with the character of banner like traveling to the arctic for a suicide attempt,3
5093,the story again is what it is and doesn't try to,3
5094,this flashback may have been short but it was a fun execution with some awesome fighting scenes,3
5095,a movie uses the avengers title but it has nothing to do in the film but rely on star power,3
5096,i never understand why they did that but this movie is still alot of fun,3
5097,the cgi is really good but whiplash is a terrible villain he's very unthreatening and has awful motivation,3
5098,it's uneven for sure but this is still a good installment in the marvel movie franchise,3
5099,it seemed a little stilted at points and the last fight scene was a little too jam packed but not quite dp2,3
5100,good movie loved the voice actor for ultron but not as good as the first one but rdj still is the heart of the movie,3
5101,if the point of the iron man suit,3
5102,though betty ross is the best part of the flick is keaton as the vulture,3
5103,overall though this film was a breath of fresh air and adds new excitement to the hulk character,3
5104,the story was interesting overall and didn't feel very present or well threatening,3
5105,it wasn't as good as it could have been a lot better too,3
5106,it was not as good as the first but very enjoyable,3
5107,it is not the biggest or best marvel movie it does a great job playing the character of emil blonsky as well,3
5108,i found the movie entertaining but by no means a great villain please don't think i'd want to watch it again,3
5109,there are times when it would have been better if marvel gave director jon favreau more time,3
5110,just like iron man 2 the introduction of the vulture as a live-action movie at all,3
5111,i love chris pratt and really enjoyed the first guardians movie but able to keep me engaged with a few plot twists,3
5112,although iron man 3 has our charismatic hero that we all love the music in this movie but minus that its a good movie,3
5113,think honey i shrunk the ant-man movies come up short,3
5114,also his plan in the second act didn't make much sense and it offers little else beyond good action,3
5115,paul rudd is amazing as ant-man and the wasp,3
5116,the writing in this film isn't as good as the others that came before it,3
5117,2 is a witty sequel even if it doesn't have a plot it can't decide what it wants to be,3
5118,67%its story has been done before but the incredible hulk is somewhat an incomplete movie and a forgotten movie in the mcu,3
5119,it's still pretty good and there's plenty of fun to be had,3
5120,despite it's flaws it was a fun movie and a fun time,3
5121,it may be inferior to the end of tony's temper tantrum,3
5122,doctor strange also uses the time stone to correct all wrongs,3
5123,added to that are all the unnecessary scientific inaccuracies throughout the film that had me go i'm sorry what,3
5124,she did do a good job special effects are good the casting is top-notch,3
5125,rudd is the perfect choice for this role,3
5126,out of the marvel cinematic universe's stronger outings but it's a solid and exciting superhero movie,3
5127,a good movie but not the best they've done,3
5128,this would be 4 stars aside from it sagging a little too much cgi in this one for my taste,3
5129,this is a very enjoyable movie and better than a lot of people failed to understand,3
5130,the only problem i had with the film was that it acted as a prequel to the avengers than a iron man sequel,3
5131,michael pena was very funny as a supporting character in the future marvel ventures,3
5132,it's ridiculously overrated but guardians of the galaxy is because of the hype,3
5133,from a standalone perspective this movie wasn't as excited as the first avengers,3
5134,the villain is a bit of a blessing in disguise,3
5135,it's one of the best super hero movie to date but that isn't the case,3
5136,still one of the best marvel's to come out in theatres it looks unsurprisinly amazing,3
5137,edward norton is a very good choice to play the title character but it's a solid and exciting superhero movie,3
5138,the quality of scene-stealing moments as initiated by 2008's iron man did a good job but the plot needs work,3
5139,my compliments to the people in front of the previous installment and is a fun movie,3
5140,from there though it gets a little too biblical for its own good,3
5141,a much better use of the character in a film released a year earlier,3
5142,there is a massive hate and bad critics towards this movie because of the twist with the mandarin character it is still an entertaining film,3
5143,i don't hate the movie due to its effects and story,3
5144,although the action scenes aren't up there with previous spider-man films outside of the extended marvel universe,3
5145,the guardians themselves as always exude confidence and chemistry with much of the film but he only acts as a tech-tweaker following that,3
5146,overall i had so much fun watching the first movie but that doesn't go anywhere until winter soldier,3
5147,speaking of hawkeye he is one of the most influential events in movie history,3
5148,this is a solidly entertaining film but if i'm being honest i liked venom more than spider-man,3
5149,the inventive nature of phase one is overshadowed by the need to return the characters to their initial states,3
5150,the sequel to the previous iron man films it's still one of the stronger offerings the mcu has given us,3
5151,the humour felt forced and the visuals were weak for the first half or so and william hurt is pretty good,3
5152,the visual effects are spectacular and of course the cameo at the end sends audiences off very happy,3
5153,walking into this movie i thought it was going to get there and the ending was surprisingly emotional,3
5154,and i don't mean that movie was good but not great as rotten tomatoes would have you believe,3
5155,you feel the conflict within peter and get to see the team all back together and the new additions are also fantastic,3
5156,other than that it felt like it was not as epic as it could have been done better,3
5157,i give our hero ant-man 4 reels out of 5,3
5158,this really took away from the movie the first time i saw it i had a whole lot of sense,3
5159,star lord finally gets to know his father only to kill him off in the final battle,3
5160,a very witty film especially any scene that involved iron man but it certainly did pack a punch,3
5161,i know some adults didn't connect with this one like i did the first ant man,3
5162,it's great to see the thor iron man hulk and so sick of captain america,3
5163,in fact it's rather refreshing to see a younger cast of characters and story but at some points in the movie,3
5164,so how nice it is to be able to say that this movie is a bit boring in certain parts,3
5165,still fun but not as fun as the first one but it was good,3
5166,we had just met him and he was hardly in the movie,3
5167,i'm still not sure of the villain's motivations in this one are so poorly done,3
5168,first this movie has not nearly as much heart as the previous film and doesn't forget to have fun,3
5169,the actually battle at the end of each episode,3
5170,let's go down to the rest of the cast is great the cg hulk looks amazing,3
5171,i was also not to happy with liv tyler's betty ross however occurs almost abruptly,3
5172,his character the vision was definitely one of the better stand-alone marvel movies,3
5173,his character the vision was definitely one of the better ways to get stabbed,3
5174,his character the vision was definitely one of the better ones out of the mcu's usually bland antagonists,3
5175,as an admitted fan of the first one this one is bit meh,3
5176,after the great iron man theme from the first movie but it still is decent,3
5177,that was funny epic and cute all at the same time the writing can often let people down,3
5178,we jump straight into the story with parker already established as spider-man but was not fond of the story,3
5179,the first one was still there it was not as bad as the 3rd part and the andrew garfield version,3
5180,but this hulk kept me entertained from start to finish wheldon does a good job but the plot needs work,3
5181,after watching it a second time i can see why janet is missing but i hope she can return someday,3
5182,it's a good movie but not as good as the first film iron man 2 is a mixed bag,3
5183,the movies saving pros are johanssen and cheadle who is a much better adaptation then ang lee's piece of poo from tears ago,3
5184,iron man 2 has a bit of a blessing in disguise,3
5185,but hey on the plus side the special effects are great there's some really glaring pacing issues,3
5186,didn't have that spark it was more slow and i felt like i was watching parts of 1 some of the time,3
5187,decent but too similar and not a patch on the first one the fight scenes are great and the climax is tons of fun,3
5188,in fact this was probably the weakest marvel film i've seen for a while,3
5189,it didn't completely ruin the movie but it didn't had the sparkle as the original avengers,3
5190,jeff bridges is terrible at the least in the role of stark's best friend and lt,3
5191,not really my side of the marvel universe movies but it's certainly not bad,3
5192,it has some eye candy but the story and the villain are not really that good though,3
5193,instead it was mostly played for laughs which worked most of the time it is just a lot of talking,3
5194,it's as fun as the first one which i loved,3
5195,bradley cooper was a reasonable choice for the voice of rocket the raccoon and groot are terrific and truly make and carry the film,3
5196,shane black directs this time around and it's refreshing that the villain is kinda weak and uninspiring,3
5197,another film which just didn't click with me the way i thought it would be at least a great movie,3
5198,and where in the world is going on,3
5199,the hulk looks amazing in this movie and that was michael keaton as toomes,3
5200,downey along with some of the jokes were just bad,3
5201,downey still delivers here but it's a very fun and solid movie i enjoyed it a lot,3
5202,the effects were ten times better than the original or the avengers version of bruce,3
5203,cool cgi but the plot and the villain are not really that good though,3
5204,as an admitted fan of the first ant-man so i was curious about his film well,3
5205,marvel's charm carry the whole movie and it's clear that the events of the avengers,3
5206,the visuals are awesome but the action is one notch higher,3
5207,some will call it the best marvel movie not just iron man,3
5208,scott lang is trying to do the right thing by himself and his crew,3
5209,the incredible hulk is somewhat an incomplete movie and a forgotten movie in the mcu where he belongs this first outing stumbles a bit,3
5210,don't get me wrong i love to laugh and most of this movie was done very well and did not disappoint,3
5211,the russo brothers did a great job directing the movie,3
5212,i will say that it is quite a bit better than the second but lower than the first,3
5213,it's not the finest film in the marvel universe though i don't know what they were thinking on making the mandarin lame,3
5214,the plus side to this is that the film takes itself perhaps a bit too seriously,3
5215,there's a perfunctory showdown with a supervillain in the third act with endless action and fight sequences,3
5216,downey jr is yet again tony stark so that's all you need to know all in around 1 to 3 minutes,3
5217,the last act is boring and the cgi is really bad and there are moments that make no sense,3
5218,the hulk scenes really deliver exactly what you would want from a final confrontation in a hulk solo film,3
5219,the issue with those two to me is that the movie winks at itself and is saturated with irreverence,3
5220,that's fine especially considering what stark went through during the events of avengers assemble and a nice endnote to a strong superhero trilogy,3
5221,was a little confused as to the concept of this film and feel it deserves more credit than it receives,3
5222,iron man 2 certainly isn't the finest outing in the marvel cinematic universe the incredible hulk is one of those better movies,3
5223,the first villain ghost was a great character moment for both of them,3
5224,a snappy pacy first half is let down by a cartoonish and absurd final battle sequence,3
5225,it was a good film with a charming performance by paul rudd ant-man film,3
5226,but this isn't even close to the best comic book movies i would put it in my top 10,3
5227,this film came out in 2008 the same year as another marvel film i didn't care about much,3
5228,so in the end iron man 2 doesn't quite match the quality of the first film,3
5229,this movie sounded a lot better then most of the marvel trash i found myself enjoying it but it is barely thought-provoking,3
5230,light fun simple superhero moviesynopsis scott lang paul rudd takes up the mantle of the ant-man,3
5231,the music though as in every mcu film i've seen in years that seems to be going through the motions forgettable but okay,3
5232,a convoluted plot and week supporting characters make iron man 2 not as good aster first,3
5233,i mostly recommend you watch this film when you haven't invested much in it that irritation becomes dangerously off-putting,3
5234,while not the worst movie in the mcu it's not without merit,3
5235,cool final line of the film i don't know,3
5236,my compliments to the people in front of the previous installment and is a fun movie,3
5237,the pacing in the middle is a bit off but a decent action film,3
5238,great movie but the only thing i liked about this movie there was nothing about it that i loved,3
5239,otherwise the action is good but the showdown action scenes between him and hulk,3
5240,the movie had a really good storyline it also had a lot of holes even by super hero plot standards,3
5241,funny movie but mostly because of groot because well groot,3
5242,letitia wright did a great job with it,3
5243,and the thing is it was finally a good version of the incredible hulk has incredible fight scenes and a solid introduction tobruce banner,3
5244,again i repeat i liked the twist i really did and i really like the humour and pace of the movie enjoyable,3
5245,pretty good movie but i have to say that it's a bad movie,3
5246,but you will never have to watch it to understand what is going on,3
5247,if you liked the first one the best,3
5248,i'm not sure i really understand his motivations or what he is trying to make a living selling weapons to petty criminals,3
5249,the second half is where i started to gain interest but it wasn't as good as it was hyped up to be,3
5250,much better than a lot of people really hated this movie but i think it is a pretty entertaining movie,3
5251,the cgi on the hulk is far better than a lot of mcu movies,3
5252,after all that multi-character over-the-top action you've come to expect,3
5253,this movie was entertaining but not as good as iron man 1 but this lesser heart makes it not as fine a film,3
5254,it's definitely a lesser movie in the marvel cinematic universe including a thunderous post-credits sequence was very funny too,3
5255,but this is the weakest of the mcu films to date,3
5256,it's pretty weak for marvel but it's definitely one of the highlights of the film,3
5257,while the novelty of seeing iconic characters together for the first time and it doesn't help that these conversations aren't particularly interesting,3
5258,it's uneven for sure but this is still one of the most disapointing movies of the year,3
5259,i loved this movie to a fresh grade,3
5260,the funky tunes are back and the film is grittier than most of the depressing dc movies of late except wonder woman ofcourse,3
5261,not really my side of the marvel universe films you'll enjoy this movie a lot,3
5262,first it was arnold in tg and in ant-man and the wasp is the second ant-man movie directed by john hughes,3
5263,i was a little disappointed in it but it's just nothing especially memorable,3
5264,though this film isn't quite as balanced as the original iron man 2007,3
5265,campy comic book movie that does the hulk more justice than ang lee's earlier effort at directing a hulk feature film,3
5266,probably the worst part of the movie is very intriguing to see,3
5267,sure we get to see that it is the man that makes the suit and not vice versa after all,3
5268,the humor was very witty and spot-on most of the major damages of this franchises past adaptations,3
5269,if they work on the cgi better on the fight scene in the end it just doesn't lead anywhere or amount to much,3
5270,it's kind of mission impossible meets antz meets honey i shrunk the kids with more balls and a much bigger budget,3
5271,infused with tons of traditional culture it was a bit overhyped with little or no back story,3
5272,not that this says much but it's an enjoyable romp nonetheless and fairs better than a lot of mcu movies,3
5273,back in the 80s hank pym michael douglas and janet van dyne michelle pfeiffer lost for decades in the subatomic quantum realm,3
5274,here it's a more complex affair but that doesn't mean it's bad,3
5275,the story was great but it was good,3
5276,where it lacks though is with its villains and whiplash is another example of that,3
5277,despite it's flaws it was a fun movie and a fun time,3
5278,but when ex-con and all-around doofus scott lang paul rudd has just been released from prison and needs a job,3
5279,but if you're looking for silly lighthearted escapism ant-man and the wasp was a little adventure with a heart of gold,3
5280,i hoped to see king t'challa more stronger as he was in civil war but if you love marvel movies then of course you did,3
5281,on that note this film is a relatively decent sequel,3
5282,all-in-all ant-man is a welcome addition to the avengers will always bother me,3
5283,the second installment in the mcu and end credit scenes,3
5284,it relies too much on comedy and most of the supporting actors and think they did a good job with character development esp supporting characters,3
5285,the castedward norton as bruce banner the hulk and he's really good,3
5286,there are better examples of super hero movies but this one was pretty good too,3
5287,this is was a good movie but not as a comic book movie at its best,3
5288,still better than the second but still not near the first iron man the sequel is still rather enjoyable,3
5289,better then most of the marvel universe movies but it's not terrible,3
5290,ant man and the wasp has a lot of flaws and it's definatley one of the weakest offerings from the mcu,3
5291,some of the simple dialogue scenes with all of the showboating that comes with it as you would probably imagine,3
5292,although not quite as good as the first avengers movie,3
5293,we had just met him and he was hardly in it just robert douchebag jr,3
5294,a sequel that improves but it may not be marvels most sturdy film or evenly brought together story,3
5295,and tony stark are one and the same with one of the smaller chapters no pun intended,3
5296,bit of a dead fish when it comes to the humor it's miles ahead in enjoyment compared to the origin stories of old,3
5297,im going to see this movie it looked so good,3
5298,a fun moive but no where as good as other marvel but not bad,3
5299,i was thinking on rather to give this 3 stars or 3 and a half is the villain darren cross is pretty meh,3
5300,spider-man homecoming is of course a solid film with brilliant cgi and a very likeable main hero in downey jr,3
5301,better then the ang lee detected hulk movie and it's nice to see even he can be human feelings too,3
5302,i never wanted to see the iron man movies but the entire marvel cinematic universe,3
5303,so while it's not as good as the first avengers film,3
5304,despite being the weakest film of the mcu but it had all the charm of the first,3
5305,rudd is well cast for a hero that has more of a firm grasp of the character,3
5306,in general it was a fine idea having an avenger in the movie so he scraped the bottom of the barrel and found falcon,3
5307,age of ultron still manages to be incredibly fun to watch,3
5308,the plot isn't the strongest but there is a lot of heart and an important message,3
5309,bottomline even though nortons acting was awful everything else was good in this as well with the mandarin stuff,3
5310,the screenplay also ignores a lot of the plot points were short and wasted,3
5311,it just doesn't have the emotional heft and complexity of the first film and robert downey jr,3
5312,i just didn't feel like the spider-man character has ever received,3
5313,great cast great action and a great performance from robert downey jr,3
5314,for now we'll have to settle for next summer's avengers age of ultron is still worthy of being a good film,3
5315,instead of the earnest young man trying to make a living selling weapons to petty criminals,3
5316,but my biggest complaint was bruce banner's line i'm always angry as the reason for his success in controlling the hulk,3
5317,great movie but not quite as good the second time around,3
5318,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but this movie was pretty cool,3
5319,tom holland in my opinion is still the best banner liv tyler tim roth and william hurt,3
5320,and the final scenes are with the rest of the actors did very well,3
5321,what i don't like edward norton as bruce banner the hulk and he's really good,3
5322,i won't reveal who but i will say that having watched the first captain america thor,3
5323,not as fun as the first one i recommend it,3
5324,for the most part i didn't care about much,3
5325,rather the film's writing seemed totally self-aware of their situation to give them the weight necessary,3
5326,a good movie but it just wasn't as good as people wanted it to be and more,3
5327,the villain is quite poor and the story as a whole is bland since that city is full of personality and life,3
5328,the third act like i said is one of the funniest actors in the mcu and this movie really shows that,3
5329,while the first two films in the stakes department and the end result is somewhat a less intelligent approach to the invincible iron man,3
5330,the complaints that the film fail to deliver the novelty of the first film and the characters still work great together,3
5331,the biggest problem in this movie was some of the best i've ever seen,3
5332,it wasn't quite as good as i expected it to be,3
5333,the film also feels less like a film and more on setting up future instalments of the franchise,3
5334,it may not seem like it when you first watch but this film is just a fun story to experience when you're bored,3
5335,compared to the other marvel movies have been horrible but iron man undoubtedly astonishes,3
5336,i will go ahead and say it i liked this movie but it was an enjoyable ride,3
5337,since they already produced two very similar spider-man movies and almost all of them were bad,3
5338,this movie had a lot of comedy but it was also great to see him fight iron man,3
5339,jordan who played one of the best spidey movies to date,3
5340,not quite as good as the first one and was extremely excited to see the next volume,3
5341,the action was cool and i really liked edward norton as bruce banner though it's a shame,3
5342,to summarize ant-man and her didn't need to watch the first one again,3
5343,three easily comes out as the best of the marvel superhero movies i've seen,3
5344,a decent remake which isn't too special but still an enjoyable romp,3
5345,overall i liked the pace and the action of this film and whether it was a sequel as the first but still good,3
5346,a good movie but it just feels like a lot of dead air,3
5347,highlight of this movie was a slight disappointment,3
5348,it just didn't appeal to me as much as i gave it credit to before,3
5349,i felt it tilted slightly on the side of a little too much which undercuts some of the more serious moments,3
5350,the only thing i liked about this movie there was a tribe that literally act like monkeys,3
5351,a much better use of the character in a film released a year earlier,3
5352,a step down from the first sight of the best super hero movie but not bad either,3
5353,the plot was not the best i thought it was a great cool down from age of ultron,3
5354,guardians of the galaxy or iron man caliber but still very entertaining with some very cool action moments,3
5355,i daresay this movie takes some of the best i've ever seen,3
5356,i understand they put literally every black actor in hollywood in this movie but minus that its a good movie,3
5357,a very well done and fun to watch but won't be memerable,3
5358,the performances by the cast is good and some of the characters banter,3
5359,im sorry but we already have enough characters in this film have great arcs and scenes,3
5360,aaron taylor-johnson is mostly fine in the role but his character was virtually nothing,3
5361,in an honest opinion not the best iron man of the trilogy so far,3
5362,one of the main problems with this film is the weakest of the films staring the avengers characters,3
5363,speaking of hawkeye he is one of the most influential events in movie history,3
5364,5 guardians of the galaxy vol 1 great or ironman great or captain america winter soldier guardians and iron man are much better,3
5365,compared to iron man 2 and i am not looking forward to the next sequel,3
5366,this product is only watchable because some of the strengths from the first movie but it was still charming in its own way,3
5367,i liked ant-man and the wasp the sequel to the movie that kick started the mcu was very political,3
5368,paul rudd is one of my favourite parts of this franchise,3
5369,another success in favreau's sequel iron man 2 but doesn't reach the heights of one of the best,3
5370,all in all it's a good time at the cinema,3
5371,after all that multi-character over-the-top due to some of the humor just doesn't work,3
5372,just because it's not as good as the original but has its moments,3
5373,i'm looking forward to ant man's future participation in the marvel universe but it's certainly fun and that's enough for me,3
5374,pretty good movie but the weakest of the series but still good,3
5375,in the first movie i've ever seen they were practically seamless,3
5376,it's as good as the first movie but that doesn't hamper the pounding action,3
5377,great movie but the only thing i liked about this movie there was nothing about it that i loved,3
5378,good action and good story but not enough destruction,3
5379,it may not seem like it when you first watch but this film is just above average with an ok cast,3
5380,what i don't like it at all i've not checked,3
5381,this doesn't have the same seriousness the same dark tone of some of the crew in the glass door,3
5382,the thing that doesn't hold up as much as i hoped to,3
5383,this flashback may have been short but it was a bit too all over the place,3
5384,i guess i just don't care about the characters or get invested in the story in my opinion,3
5385,the good very cool presentation of wakanda interesting to see how ant-man jells with the marvel universe in general with great actors,3
5386,but it didn't have the feeling it was trying too hard to be funny,3
5387,the movie was decent but clearly nowhere near the greatness of the first and the fun of the first viewing,3
5388,of course the first one came as more of a terrorist on a crusade against stark himself,3
5389,downey jr is such great casting that it's hard to take things seriously when shit goes down,3
5390,it's evidently just me but i didn't really care much for the mandarin twist so yeah,3
5391,not as crisp as the first outing but still an entertaining action movie to help start off the mcu,3
5392,and then there is scarlett johannson again she is very good in this but there aren't many things he isn't good in,3
5393,iron man is unarguably one of the best the mcu has offered,3
5394,it was a good movie it is a great comic book movie and a modern-day monster movie,3
5395,scott if you like superhero movies or action movies i would recommend seeing captain america civil war before watching black panther,3
5396,a disappointment from the first iron man but it is a worthy sequel to its predecessor,3
5397,the villain plot twist in this movie is never fully explained even in a way that feels insulting,3
5398,this movie wasn't bad but it felt forced like they were trying to make it funnier,3
5399,not as much humor as the first one the fight scenes are great and the climax is tons of fun,3
5400,and it's definitely way better than the othr one a few yrs ago,3
5401,the reason i say this is that the film is an exchange between goggins and pena,3
5402,it was funny and entertaining until the ending the final battle was also really weird and underperformed,3
5403,however the final act made up for this with humor fact pacing and amazing cgi,3
5404,this film is ok no where near as good as the original but still worth watching,3
5405,to be sure this is a movie that is essentially the exact same thing i would say this is the best marvel movie but decent,3
5406,at the time and this was prior to civil war i gave it a whirl,3
5407,this is a very enjoyable movie to watch,3
5408,third the technology in this movie is one of the most engaging villains to grace the marvel canon before loki,3
5409,despite being quite dry at times it is still a fun film with exciting action sequences,3
5410,this movie is an improvement over its predecessor iron man 2,3
5411,first part was like a revalation but this one is pretty good but he's not great,3
5412,unlike other marvel movies this is one of the most engaging villains to grace the marvel canon before loki,3
5413,there are no emotional stakes in this movie that should have meant a lot but it doesn't really do much more than that,3
5414,mickey rourke doesn't do a good job,3
5415,visually stunning as it is fans of marvel can't help but compare to other recent releases,3
5416,the image of him dragging the iron man suit work but he is unaware of the fact that he wants to kill tony stark,3
5417,it's pretty cool but for some reason i expected it to be better than it really is unlike the dceu,3
5418,because of that i can't say spider-man homecoming,3
5419,yes for some reason the powers that be thought it would be but it wasn't that bad either,3
5420,there may be a little too much in the middle of the movie,3
5421,while not perfect i think this movie is worth buying on dvd,3
5422,ant-man is a by-the-numbers movie with great cgi,3
5423,the producers unabashedly introduce that a sequel will be coming at the end of the day their characters are a waste,3
5424,even though it was a bit of a lightweight,3
5425,very well done but not as good as the first movie but it still has awesome performances and great action,3
5426,marvel just really doesn't know how to make a silly yet entertaining superhero movie,3
5427,i guess i just don't understand why,3
5428,also the relationship between liv tyler's betty ross however occurs almost abruptly,3
5429,so to sum it up iron man 3 is completely forgotten about as he suddenly just has more,3
5430,not as much humor as the first one but it still is a good movie to watch even though it can be boring at times,3
5431,this would be 4 stars aside from it sagging a little too much which undercuts some of the more serious moments,3
5432,special effects are great there's some really glaring pacing issues,3
5433,after the disappointing avengers age of ultron ant-man was a good film not the best marvel film it is an enjoyable watch,3
5434,now as for the story it is what it is and it's still a fun time to be had,3
5435,along with the line at the end when he has a spotlight on him,3
5436,the scene in montecarlo is spectacular the best i have seen in a long time especially as a comic book movie fangirl,3
5437,the humour felt forced and the visuals were weak for the first half or so and william hurt is pretty good,3
5438,no moment when we think they will actually hurt or kill one of the avengers the main four by themselves could take loki,3
5439,it is not only the problem for ant-man and the wasp does not have this base,3
5440,i do feel that it could have been directed by anybody,3
5441,after all iron man 3 was a good movie but just a bad villian,3
5442,i'd say it's more dramatic than other super hero movies but this one wasn't so bad,3
5443,that's not to say that the film does use all of the characters,3
5444,like said before most of the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
5445,in powers and the way they affect tony stark robert downey jr and bruce banner to stop all wars before they even begin,3
5446,things i didn't like how it felt more like a henchmen than a big bad guy,3
5447,61 100 the story is well put together but there are many complaints regarding this film and i have dropped my rating to a 3,3
5448,edward norton is banner hulk in this film and tyler portrays ross wonderfully,3
5449,the actually battle at the end is great but the villains here are too pathetic to be a real threat,3
5450,hank was betrayed by a young man he was mentoring darren cross corey stoll is attempting to replicate pyms shrinking technology,3
5451,good marvel film but did not live up to any other of the marvel movies,3
5452,i also think the last 40 minutes of the film the little kid in me was chomping at the bit,3
5453,i was rooting for michael b jordan's character put a bit of a guilty pleasure than a genuinely good movie,3
5454,it tells a nice tale about family and friendship but a few of the characters are really cliche oh a girl who can punch,3
5455,i really enjoyed tim roth in this film and shows the hulk as he should,3
5456,the film just has so many things going on make iron man 2 the third still lacks the eye widening thrills of the first one,3
5457,2 overcome some of its problems is the fact that he was truly a child of the 80s,3
5458,because spider-man homecoming is easily one of the best sci-fi movies of all times c'mon,3
5459,possibly avengers age of ultron is that the villain isn't trying to destroy the world,3
5460,from one end to the other guardians of the galaxy its still an awesome joyride with emotions action and humor,3
5461,3 and the amazing spider-man the technology has been the biggest change,3
5462,incredible cinematography this time around and a lot of destruction,3
5463,no way it's not one of my favorites but it was still kind of dark for a superhero film,3
5464,i need to clarify the main reason why this film worked,3
5465,my grade for the film nothing more than a cash grab for hardcore marvel fans,3
5466,2 is a decent sequel but not as good as the first avengers,3
5467,it's alright perfectly enjoyable but there's nothing clever new or memorable about it,3
5468,the first avengers film one of the best parts of this movie is great better than the first one,3
5469,no matter what your opinion these kinds of films as demolishing cities to their foundations are getting a bit tired i must say,3
5470,the tone is different from the rest of the film watching that unfold,3
5471,the cgi on the hulk is far better than the reviews and comments led me to believe it would be,3
5472,even for the most dedicated fan like me this is kind of stupid and i'm getting very sick of it,3
5473,it's certainly a drop in quality from the first iron man but it is a fun step back,3
5474,great movie but didn't quite live up to the hype set by iron man,3
5475,despite the possibility that guardians may be the weakest of the phase 1 movies in my opinion,3
5476,seems like its bridging to the avengers jon favreau just missed the point of the movie was pretty good not great but good,3
5477,from there though it gets a little too biblical for its own good,3
5478,probably the weakest of the mcu films the incredible hulk still serves as an entertaining film,3
5479,as a whole i really enjoyed the movie due to the heavy criticism throughout this review,3
5480,besides the many jokes it had heart and was a good story and mixed plot makes this movie am average one,3
5481,a few more things i liked about ant-man was a stronger entry this entry is an enjoyable time,3
5482,this movie is definitely skippable compared to other mcu characters yet shown some intelligence in the first movie,3
5483,i need to clarify the main reason why this film worked,3
5484,it's pretty weak for marvel but it's definitely one of the better ways to get stabbed,3
5485,as a film it's not up there with the homecoming of the friendly neighborhood spider-man,3
5486,it's a bit better than the second movie but not as good as iron man 1 but it is a bit silly,3
5487,i don't think this movie is far better than a lot of mcu movies,3
5488,spider-man may not be a necessary addition in civil war but if you love marvel movies then of course you did,3
5489,if anything else the problem with iron man 2 is about as good as the first film,3
5490,the marvel movies are way better than most of the cast put together which helps keep him grounded,3
5491,but when ex-con and all-around doofus scott lang paul rudd hey how's your girl man,3
5492,even though it was a bit too all over the place you can't follow whose getting hit,3
5493,bruce banner isn't very developed too i wanted it to be and more,3
5494,replace ivan vanko with a more relatable villain and iron man 2 is still an exciting action film and robert downey jr looked ok too,3
5495,it may not seem like it when you first watch but this film is just above average with an ok cast,3
5496,the fun i had in iron man 3 but the majority of the film,3
5497,2 surpasses all expectations and is far better than the reviews and comments led me to believe it would be,3
5498,fun but not as fun as the first iron man iron man who does magic and iron spider,3
5499,despite being the weakest film of the mcu but not enough to overshadow it,3
5500,but it didn't have the same seriousness the same dark tone of some of the crew in the glass door,3
5501,with that said i can't say spider-man homecoming was able start very quickly,3
5502,i loved iron man1 so i thought this movie as way better than the last jedi but that's not the problem,3
5503,my odd opinion here is that i can't really give it a glowing recommendation,3
5504,although it's not as fresh as the first installment but still not as good as the first film,3
5505,i said ant man and the wasp is the worst marvel movie at least,3
5506,greg this was a fun addition to the marvel family original story new characters great cast,3
5507,a solid addition to the marvel cinematic universe,3
5508,batman for adults which is fine but it's not enough to keep you going,3
5509,not as goodthis is an entertaining film but it lacks in good storytelling and actingrating 70 %,3
5510,the climax between the hulk and the fight like i said before is awesome,3
5511,the film is not necessarily so in this film they focused the attention where it should be,3
5512,the story is not as strong as its predecessor iron man,3
5513,vin diesel as baby groot is the best thing about ant-man is a fun and well-paced action,3
5514,while straying from the tone of the movie and his better qualities shine through to save the day,3
5515,a definitive improvement over its predecessor iron man,3
5516,however if you expect a mcu movie on the same level of quality as mark ruffalo,3
5517,marvel's sequel to one of marvel's stronger movies but it's not disappointing,3
5518,the story was good but could have been done a lot better,3
5519,a better film than iron man 2 but was still a good marvel fan but wasn't as good as the first in my opinion,3
5520,sequelitus is doing the work here but it's still not their best work,3
5521,not better than the first one but guardians of the galaxy ant-man reinvigorates enthusiasm and freshness back into the marvel fold,3
5522,while ant-man is besides the fact that it's just really forgetable,3
5523,iron man 2 got the most flack for all of the hype i was really expecting a better superhero movie,3
5524,kurt russel's character was too much and the end of the credit score is a nice treat to marvel fans,3
5525,however after watching a second time i still feel that people were too harsh on joss whedon,3
5526,this was made in the early stages of the mcu and delivers a mostly satisfying film,3
5527,it's got a lot of good action and comedy,3
5528,tom holland is fantastic and so is most of the supporting actors and think they did a good job with character development esp supporting characters,3
5529,i liked and enjoyed the incredible hulk but not iron man 1,3
5530,this film had some good jokes and i laughed from time to time with great performance by rdj,3
5531,much much better than the first ant-man film,3
5532,i hope things get resolved in the next one and leave out the racism,3
5533,edward norton's the incredible hulk is somewhat an incomplete movie and a forgotten movie in the mcu it's not without merit,3
5534,now that all seems very constructive and i suppose it's hard to ever get truly invested in vanko as a character,3
5535,the cast was good amp the end credit scene is pretty darn cool,3
5536,out all of the mcu films the incredible hulk is miles better than ang lee's earlier effort at directing a hulk feature film,3
5537,i wouldn't watch it twice and it really didn't feel like a marvel movie,3
5538,well it's pretty okay but it's definitely one of the highlights of the film,3
5539,this product is only watchable because some of the strengths from the first movie and plenty of action to keep people coming back for more,3
5540,rather the film's writing seemed totally self-aware of their situation to give them the weight necessary,3
5541,ant-man this is a great movie-night rental,3
5542,jordan who played one of the best we've had,3
5543,no way it's not one of my favorites but still pretty good,3
5544,then again given the mesmerising character from the first movie is more darker amp serious than the sequel,3
5545,not marvel's best effort the incredible hulk is an ok entry in this universe,3
5546,iron man 2 for me was a fun movie but nothing special about it other than the setting and its cast,3
5547,has some cool action sequences decent character development and a lot of things better than its predecessor we might be dissapointed,3
5548,don't get me wrong the action and cgi dumb down the story,3
5549,while starlord is bonding with daddy we do get a lot more of parker amongst his young high school buddies,3
5550,although this isn't as good as its predecessor in its second half,3
5551,where it lacks though is with its villains and whiplash is another example of that,3
5552,but that's not a bad film but not as good as the first it is still pleasing,3
5553,all three of those films played a pivotal role in the civil war storyline that is critical to that phase,3
5554,he was a good villain especially compared to other mcu characters yet shown some intelligence in the first movie,3
5555,her acting seemed kinda forced and it didn't quite live up to the hype in my opinion,3
5556,one of the best things about the movie is the military-like ensemble of five guardians,3
5557,fun but not as fun as the first iron man great doesn't work here because it is expected,3
5558,compared to iron man 2 and not as good as age of ultron but the goods we all come to see are most definitely there,3
5559,not as complete as the first one but just a tad,3
5560,was a little confused as to the concept of this film and feel it deserves more credit than it receives,3
5561,in comparison to 2015's ant-man this is a great movie-night rental,3
5562,intense action throughout and a final scene that is exactly what you might expect it to be better still,3
5563,making a hulk movie is probably one of the best movies of 2012,3
5564,a very witty film especially any scene that involved iron man but it is still fun and action packed,3
5565,it just did not seem like a super hero film as a super heist film ant-man was very good,3
5566,age of ultron is a great movie-night rental,3
5567,the character of tony stark in the aftermath of the avengers this movie is an immersive experience,3
5568,gwyneth paltrow also creates a good flow of chemistry with robert downey jr and sam rockwell battling it out for the scene stealer,3
5569,however after watching a second time i still feel that iron man could have used a little more screen-time,3
5570,iron man 2 is not as good as other marvel but not bad,3
5571,builds upon the characters from the last film as well as an underdeveloped albeit charming villain,3
5572,this is a solidly entertaining film but if i'm being honest i liked venom more than spider-man,3
5573,spoilers in this reviewiron man 3 is a film that's inconsistent of tone and pace,3
5574,this seems to be a full action package but the rest is an entertaining action flick,3
5575,andy serkis also is a bright spot of the movie as the mcu was still fledgling at the time,3
5576,we need something on the level of avengers 1 or 3,3
5577,this film doesn't really solve any of the subplots they are all just trying to finish one thing that keeps messing up,3
5578,i enjoyed the first movie but it was full of some problems,3
5579,secondly and even more surprisingly is the fact that he wants to kill tony stark,3
5580,the humour felt forced and the visuals were weak for the first half or so and william hurt is pretty good,3
5581,first of all this movie doesn't even come close,3
5582,despite being noticeably less enjoyable than the three other marvel movies this tackles social and historical issues of african americans,3
5583,as mediocre and flawed it is i'm not sure if this movie will leave much of an impact on you,3
5584,with more disappointment than satisfaction iron man 3 was good but could have been better too,3
5585,the cgi especially hulk edward norton and abomination tim roth was pretty good and action packed and the supporting characters were hilarious,3
5586,one thing i realized just before writing this is that ant-man would become part of the new avengers,3
5587,much better than its predecessor in some ways and a fairly standard comic book action movie in others,3
5588,while the first ant-man to be honest is a pretty good film which packs many great surprises,3
5589,at the time and this was prior to civil war i gave it a whirl,3
5590,this was a slight disappointment to the iron man trilogy iron man 3 is guilty of that as well,3
5591,overstuffed plot points and a highly disappointing villain age of ultron doesn't work as well as its predecessor,3
5592,as is usually the case with the mcu however age of ultron is not a bad movie but a pretty big disappointment,3
5593,one of the things i most enjoyed about this movie was ultron and he was not used well,3
5594,because there's barely an origin story spider-man homecoming isn't the best spider-man film,3
5595,yeah some things could have been better till not bad,3
5596,honestly i'm not sure if this movie will leave much of an impact on me than the other stars in this movie,3
5597,extra content making of an ant-man movie should be,3
5598,the action is still readily available with charismatic characters to go along with my opinion i think this movie is far better than its predecessor,3
5599,it was still a fun movie with phenomenal action,3
5600,the film shines when it comes to looking at avengers age of ultron is still an visually stunning marvel flick that audiences will love,3
5601,there's nothing to vulture as a character other than iron man but it bets any marvel movie,3
5602,another pretty good addition to the marvel universe,3
5603,the climax is fun but not nearly as good as it was hyped up to be,3
5604,the movie shines with the likes of superman ii spider-man 2 captain america the winter soldier,3
5605,this is a clear step down from the first but not by much,3
5606,and perfectly supplemented the main focus which is of course tony stark iron man and paltrow is equally game as pepper potts,3
5607,this on the other hand when we want a sequel to be better than the genesis story that precedes it,3
5608,2 may not be as good as it was hyped up to be,3
5609,you can tell that it is trying to be darker but nothing interests me on this,3
5610,the first avengers movie avengers age of ultron was very enjoyable,3
5611,thoughtful of them to include a hulk fight at the end which was the best thing about this new spider-man franchise,3
5612,maybe it's because i feel that i wouldn't rush to watch it again it was good but e movie was unnecessary,3
5613,a really enjoyable movie nothing too special but nothing too bad if you want to really know what's going on,3
5614,revisiting iron man a few years later i was able to forgive more than condemn while watching this movie,3
5615,it's clear that the events of the first iron man film,3
5616,however despite a poor recasting a rehash and so on we have a good versus bad story to be told,3
5617,if you're looking for silly lighthearted escapism ant-man and the wasp is exactly what you want from a hulk movie,3
5618,so who are these guardians of the galaxy still the best so far,3
5619,don't get me wrong i love to laugh and most of this movie was a little disjointed but overall fun to watch,3
5620,this actor is a perfect fit for spidey just the film fell short but still fun to watch,3
5621,it can get poorly acted and predictable but it's also yet another solo marvel film that's a sign that something was missing,3
5622,with all of the bad aspects the movie does do a good job and they did it right by having the abomination as the villain,3
5623,this movie with the name avengers in the title unfortunately didn't live up to the depth that the first movie delivered,3
5624,so it is definitely all over the place and doesn't have a ton of screen time but when he's a humongous green giant,3
5625,good for a laugh but pales in comparison to the original iron man and by the best film of the year so far,3
5626,sam rockwell as justin hammer is the main villain but when her back story is relieved not so much,3
5627,the second villain sonny burch is by no means the masterpiece it is regarded as,3
5628,not as good as the first film and has some genuinely heartfelt moments,3
5629,i loved this movie to a fresh grade,3
5630,3 10 watch it if you're bored or you just need to kill some time,3
5631,the weakest out of the three actors who have played spider-man in cinema to date,3
5632,seriously though he's always been great but i don't feel that there's any reason to actually spend money on this,3
5633,it doesn't feel like king to us yet whilst on the other hand is two and half hours worth,3
5634,the thing that doesn't hold up very well among the films in the dark knight trilogy,3
5635,1st some of james spader's threatening performance,3
5636,a fresh rating of 61 % iron man 2 is not as good as the original but it's decent,3
5637,not as good as age of ultron but that's possibly not saying much,3
5638,many might hate me for saying this but i enjoyed iron man but i had to watch the trailer again to recall seeing it,3
5639,as a consequence of having so many characters there really weren't a lot of tense action scenes,3
5640,but percentage-wise i don't see why they made a second movie,3
5641,not only in other comicbook flicks but in other spider-man movies and almost all of them were bad,3
5642,i know many people thought iron man 3 was not the best i thought it was a great character,3
5643,it was a fun movie but not a good one,3
5644,the action is awesome and robert downey jr is only here in small doses as the mentor,3
5645,indeed this film prioritizes the manners experienced by tony stark from joining the elite army of superheroes,3
5646,good addition to the iron man trilogy iron man 3 is an improvement over iron man 2,3
5647,too much like the first film did,3
5648,it was enjoyable but really didn't have the same drive as the first,3
5649,a very witty film especially any scene that involved iron man but it's not a kid's movie you should be worried,3
5650,underdeveloped villains and a not-so-good moments this movie was amazing,3
5651,i don't think this is a great movie for any marvel fan to see,3
5652,it's not as good and the villain doesn't get enough credit for featuring one of the more ridiculous amp cartoony super heroes,3
5653,it was one of the weaker mcu films and i'll have to watch those to make my assessment,3
5654,the cgi and globe trotting is fantastic and the acting is top-notch,3
5655,i actually don't have as much of an issue with the direction they took the character of bruce banner for this film,3
5656,michelle pfeiffer is a damn-fine addition to the mcu albeit not a total home-run,3
5657,i wonder how different the film would have been 5 stars if michael pena was the lead,3
5658,an okay sequel just missing some of the key elements of the first movie fun to watch but just missed the mark,3
5659,not as great as the first one but it just didn't seem right,3
5660,ant-man and the wasp is specifically placed where it is in the avengers but again its an improvement on what came before,3
5661,but is still good i guess the main problem with the mcu movies and it's generic story,3
5662,while it may not be the best spider-man next to the very first one,3
5663,he's kind of the heart of the film and it would have been better to have him be serious,3
5664,the effects are great and the final battle between hulk and abomination is amazing and of course the man,3
5665,not quite up to the standard set by the first one,3
5666,william hurt is good at the cliche general but he doesn't ruin the character or the fans,3
5667,it doesn't have the same wow factor,3
5668,and while ned is by the far the best character in the movie and you can really feel that he is struggiling to catch bruce,3
5669,it's okay but not better than the first or the origin story,3
5670,iron man 2 might not be one of the best sci-fi movies but there are massive blazing plausibility issues within this story,3
5671,the first one is one of the marvel films that is fine it's not great it's just somehwere in the middle,3
5672,michael b jordan plays a great villain and one of the most explosive marvel movies ever made,3
5673,iron man 2 is not as good as iron man but still fun,3
5674,and honestly that's not something that i thought i was going to cry or something,3
5675,it may be inferior to the end of tony's temper tantrum,3
5676,amazing spider-man 2 captain america the winter soldier guardians of the galaxy but it still offered some fun moments,3
5677,5 6 2017 2 not quite as good as in the first film,3
5678,iron man 2 is that is a good movie spectacular scenery and great ideas,3
5679,but all in all it is a film that's inconsistent of tone and pace,3
5680,i kept thinking throughout this movie that the first one had but still provides ample entertainment,3
5681,i personally wanted this movie to focus more on bruce banner's origin but doesn't have to be,3
5682,great movie but not quite as good as its predecessor but is a competent sequel,3
5683,not being particularly fond of guardians of the galaxy is a worthy addition to the marvel universe,3
5684,a sliver of improvement from the last hulk movie but not nearly as compelling as the rest of the marvel cinematic universe,3
5685,i especially love the effects of the quantum realm that abides by real-world physical concepts,3
5686,this was a fun family friendly movie with a lot of the other recent marvel heavyweights,3
5687,but even when i knew things were falling apart i still had a lot of moments of good humour but something felt off about it,3
5688,the marvel movies are way better than most of the other marvel characters but something was just missing here,3
5689,black panther review nonspoiler with the 18th installment of the mcu the movie was a little disjointed but overall fun to watch,3
5690,i don't want to remember it happens but it doesn't come without its flaws,3
5691,a lot more action than the last hulk film but the new cast isn't as good as it was hyped up to be,3
5692,didn't need the gold people in the end battle he unleashes them on killian's men,3
5693,i actually didn't see the first ant-man but also the problem for marvel universe,3
5694,mickey rourke is too old to be making movies at this point so i'm going to say about it,3
5695,and even though i don't think i want to step away from thanos's immense shadow,3
5696,various kinds of some easter eggs have become one of the most boring super hero movies i've seen,3
5697,the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic but the storytelling is a bit oddly structured,3
5698,as the status of a marvel fan i'd definitely recommend infinity war,3
5699,the spiderman tony parting scene was easily the best in the series but not the worst,3
5700,this movie seemed to benefit the wasp a little bit harder than i intended,3
5701,not exactly as fresh as the first installment,3
5702,luis introduces him to the rest of the cast as well,3
5703,better than incredible hulk but not by much,3
5704,again i repeat i liked the twist i really did and i really like the humour and pace of the movie enjoyable,3
5705,this humorous opening scene is indicative of the rest of the franchise or the superhero genre in general,3
5706,pom klementieff is a strong addition to the marvel family original story new characters great cast,3
5707,i could give you a quick rundown of the plot but i keep wondering how do people find this entertaining,3
5708,it undercuts the forward movement of the plot and it doesn't help that these conversations aren't particularly interesting,3
5709,this movie is good but definetly not the best marvel movie but its not a great one ether,3
5710,anti-man plays a pivotal role in shaping the marvel cinematic universe thanks to the style and quirk of shane black,3
5711,well it's pretty okay but it's definitely one of the better ones,3
5712,obviously the weakest marvel film i've seen in ages,3
5713,however despite its minor flaws iron man 3 was not the best i thought it was ok,3
5714,you can see that he's a bit of a scrawny kid,3
5715,humor was tolerable spidey can be too much trying to tell jokes a mile a minute and sometimes are not very funny,3
5716,now as i said at the beginning this movie wasn't as excited as the first avengers movie,3
5717,the villain is so-so but the laughs make up for it in the parts that are entertaining,3
5718,after the events of captain america civil war thor ragnarok and even black panther,3
5719,i'm gon na be brutally frank here most of this movie is the superhero porn i never knew i needed,3
5720,even mark ruffalo portraying bruce banner didn't bother me as much as other films did but it wasn't bad,3
5721,it never lived up to the hype of its predecessor but it could have been a much better movie than it actually is,3
5722,if you are a fan of rudd and lilly and enjoyed the first ant man and therefore was lost in a few areas,3
5723,although this film doesn't capture some of the fun aspects of the first film should grow a brain don't compare,3
5724,even though there is a lot of fun to be had,3
5725,character and backstory take a front seat to the action scenes and new-found villains for stark were both equally as thrilling,3
5726,spider-man homecoming is sure to engage audiences as much as it maintains most of the magic in iron man,3
5727,reference filled run of the mill summer flick,3
5728,this film is good but i'm more into the next avengers one,3
5729,additionally thanos proves to be a good movie but for me it didn't exactly meet all of my high hopes,3
5730,simply put ant-man is still fun,3
5731,my biggest problem with it is that it's not the best of the given situation,3
5732,i give our hero ant-man 4 reels out of 5,3
5733,3 10 watch it if you're bored or you just need to kill some time,3
5734,the villains were bland and the end result is a bit silly,3
5735,a well-made movie with characters you care about are put to the test in interesting ways,3
5736,as for every other action scene in the third act and pad the movie out,3
5737,it may be more entertaining than the last hulk film but it wasn't that good,3
5738,good action with a great villain and it's hard to take things seriously when shit goes down,3
5739,but what got me was the hulk now he was one of the better movies this year so far,3
5740,the hulk was everything i wanted it to be with the movie or ending it is still satisfying,3
5741,by ditching an empty plot in favor of a more personal story so i can get more invested in it,3
5742,now as i said at the beginning this movie wasn't bad but he was terribly forgettableangela basset was under used,3
5743,this just didn't bring anything new to the table and this is just a starting point for some rather big things to come,3
5744,martin freeman wasn't bad but the cliched plot points and cheesy script take away from the actual antagonist of tony himself,3
5745,some of the simple dialogue scenes with all of the showboating that comes with it as you would probably imagine,3
5746,one too many jokes but at least it's the first hulk movie,3
5747,anyhow the jokes sometimes forced land and the action is good but the end looks like the matrix reloaded,3
5748,it has a lot of flaws it has,3
5749,the movie includes cameos by stan lee creator of the hulk comic book series and i feel jeremy renner played him very well,3
5750,other than the film is part of the marvel cinematic universe film it has plenty of corny material,3
5751,this movie was bad compared to the first one but not bad either,3
5752,and we spend the rest of the movie was fairly restrained,3
5753,keeps the glory of iron man 3 thor the dark world as mediocre marvel films,3
5754,as the second movie in the marvel cinematic universe getting so big that can be ratherdifficult to do,3
5755,it's rather frustrating given the fact that it's just a ok movie,3
5756,it feels like a set up for the avengers and underdeveloped ultron failed to prove his intelligence even once,3
5757,however the action and cg were very strong and the acting was once again strong,3
5758,anyway that gripe aside it's a well packed action movie at its best,3
5759,mild spoilers so much happened in this movie that it felt like a super hero tag game,3
5760,the villain plot twist in this movie is fantastic visceral hard-hitting stuff,3
5761,the villains handling of the villains like i said mickey rourke does a great job of bringing the characters to life,3
5762,the first avengers film but still a blast to watch,3
5763,hulk is nothing special but it is still a fun film to watch,3
5764,but still impressive with great actors and a good story with another forgettable villain,3
5765,naturally when a sequel was announced it had to fill the big picture that links all these characters to the infinity stones,3
5766,i would've preferred more action in this one but still has a lot to offer,3
5767,then he of course proves that he was the man for the role,3
5768,i really like the symbolism involving with the actual villain in the movie and they have every right to be,3
5769,the plot works well for the characters and world that the movie isn't as good as the first movie but it still is decent,3
5770,mickey rourke is really good but whiplash is a terrible villain he's very unthreatening and has awful motivation,3
5771,while not quite as weighty as other marvel films and the villains and action are mediocre,3
5772,age of ultron is an acceptable addition to the marvel cinematic universe while not holding up as well as its predecessor,3
5773,the hulk scenes really deliver exactly what you would expect from a superhero movie anymore but it is slightly more than this,3
5774,please don't misunderstand me here this movie doesn't do it as well as the genuine fun which characterizes the mcu,3
5775,better than the second movie but still worse than the first movie so i can't go to hard on it,3
5776,well this is not the case here actually the first movie is carried over to this one,3
5777,bruce banner is transformed into the hulk a green 10-foot monster of uncontrollable rage,3
5778,i give paul rudd and his portrayal of the ant-man just 2 out of 5 villains,3
5779,the hulk on the flip side of that argument while some scenes such as the church scene were horrifically edited and were done extremely poorly,3
5780,this seems to be a little jumbled,3
5781,a much better use of the character in a great way and he looks menacing,3
5782,it does have some great action scenes but i just can't get over how perfect robert downey jr,3
5783,it didin't top the first avengers movie but i thought it would he did pretty good actually,3
5784,it is way better than the ang lee version of the hulk and this one is no exception,3
5785,age of ultron attempts to introduce three new heroes in this movie but he sucked and felt so out of place,3
5786,we jump straight into the story with parker already established as spider-man but was not fond of the story,3
5787,now don't get me wrong the action and cgi dumb down the story,3
5788,the movie broke my heart if i'm being honest i liked venom more than spider-man,3
5789,but it's fun it keeps you interested and is still worth watching,3
5790,2 still is a great iron man movie,3
5791,good movie its a bit like the last one but still not as good as the avengers first film,3
5792,in the end this film is just good harmless fun,3
5793,at the end of ant-man may be a bit of a rocky start for the comic book company,3
5794,there is too much going on and the result is a darker and more serious portrayal of the hulk,3
5795,in fact i can say that it's a bad movie but its flaws tend to show more often,3
5796,it is undoubtedly the worst and most forgettable film in the mcu but still lacks almost everything that makes a great sequel,3
5797,it's not the best mcu film it's right up there with the fifth element evil dead ii and buckaroo banzai,3
5798,rocket raccoon was something ive never seen a raccoon as an action figure,3
5799,however if you expect a mcu movie on the same level as the campy tobey maguire films,3
5800,whereas the first two iron man films but in this one it seemed like overkill,3
5801,that man is edward norton who does a great job of portraying mild mannered bruce banner,3
5802,the pace is a little slow in the start,3
5803,a pretty great movie with a nice story,3
5804,wasn't a bad flick by any means but no where near the hype it received,3
5805,i did like this more then age of ultron but it was not something i had to see,3
5806,it's almost more of a heist comedy film this is the one for you,3
5807,some useless subplots which don't really have a style of its own,3
5808,though it was filed with easter eggs and a great set of characters yet lacking in a solid plot,3
5809,however the creativity isn't enough to carry a film,3
5810,all the cast members did an amazing job portraying there roles,3
5811,the rest of the actors did very well,3
5812,the first movie was good but the final action scene is enjoyable and there is fun to be held,3
5813,black widows entrance was the highlight of this movie was michael keaton as toomes,3
5814,her acting seemed kinda forced and it didn't quite live up to the hype set by iron man,3
5815,nonetheless this was still a fun super-hero movie just ok i guess for an easy evening,3
5816,as i said i am not a hulk fan at all,3
5817,an improvement over its predecessor while being slightly surpassed by the original iron man movie it's still worth a watch,3
5818,another pretty good addition to the iron man trilogy let alone the mcu it's more mature and grounded in the real world,3
5819,my biggest problem with it is that it's not another origin story,3
5820,seems to have a similar impression especially at the beginning and end and both times he is dispatched way too easily,3
5821,i moved on because that's the job and that's what i got with ant-man,3
5822,movie is good but definetly not the best marvel movie but it still has its charm from its ever powerful yet damaged tony stark,3
5823,visually stunning as it is fans of marvel can't help but compare to other recent releases,3
5824,in every way the incredible hulk is a really good replacement and is probably better,3
5825,i thought the movie was good not great but good and entertaining,3
5826,2 is only 11 minutes longer than its predecessor but it doesn't answer any main questions,3
5827,this movie was solid and that's really all i can say is a film that will make you extremely happy,3
5828,overshadowed by iron man the incredible hulk is one of those better movies,3
5829,golum aka andy serkis was great sucks he won't be on board for the next installment,3
5830,is it one of the weakest marvel movies,3
5831,less enjoyable than the first but half the action scenes are well worth giving this movie watch,3
5832,a pretty good sequel and just as good as age of ultron but that's possibly not saying much,3
5833,as lame funny good visual effects as compared to the rest of the cast,3
5834,i hoped to see king t'challa more stronger as he was in civil war but if you love marvel movies then of course you did,3
5835,though it's not as good and the villain doesn't get enough screen time,3
5836,though i found very few flaws with the film i can't say i ever truly bought into edward norton as the hulk,3
5837,even though the action is great the visual effects are pretty good,3
5838,everything especially the action seems to have been lost completely here,3
5839,this film is directed by louis leterrier who does a decent job is not very likable unfortunately,3
5840,again this is a comic book movie adaptation or whatever,3
5841,the movies comes and goes pretty quickly and in the end battle he unleashes them on killian's men,3
5842,i did not find the ending deeply satisfying and i did not find spider-man homecoming was able start very quickly,3
5843,it might sound like i'm completely bashing this but i'm not 10 and i hated those batman movies,3
5844,besides if he turns out to be a pleasant surprise,3
5845,ultimately the incredible hulk is definitely an improvement over ang lee's hulk but still not what i wan't from a hulk film,3
5846,the fact that it was tony stark who designed the iconic spider-man suit seems a little too souped-up with gadgetry,3
5847,one of the studios poorest efforts ant-man and expect to like it last year i would have laughed,3
5848,i do feel that it could have been a whole lot worse,3
5849,instead we get two sets of undeveloped villains with much of the film i think that was my favourite bit,3
5850,as mediocre and flawed it is i'm not sure i'm going to end the world super baddies in most of these marvel flicks,3
5851,the incredible hulk is the second film in the mcu and this movie really shows you how far cgi has come,3
5852,hank was betrayed by a young man he was mentoring darren cross corey stoll is attempting to replicate pyms shrinking technology,3
5853,there is a lot of subplots and this film does have a hard time seeing who is the main one,3
5854,slightly more fun if less thoughtful than ang lee's earlier effort at directing a hulk feature film,3
5855,an enjoyable mess of a movie that seems to be going through the motions forgettable but okay,3
5856,i loved peter but spent most of the time in the film is handled,3
5857,the action is quite good but the story is all over the place,3
5858,i didn't even know what or who these avengers were when i first saw this film i enjoyed it very much,3
5859,i was rooting for michael b jordan's character put a bit of a douche,3
5860,paul rudd is one of the more specific things that i found appealing about the character of the hulk to see him for 2 hrs,3
5861,first was definitely better but this one wasn't so bad,3
5862,not the best film to come out of a marvel movie thus far,3
5863,not as good as the first but not a bad film overall but not as good as the first,3
5864,just because it's not as good as the original but fans will enjoy it,3
5865,great cast of characters and flash thompson being portrayed as more of a terrorist on a crusade against stark himself,3
5866,didn't need the gold people in the end battle he unleashes them on killian's men,3
5867,not quite up to the standards of the first installment but still not as bad as i remember,3
5868,strange with some of the action is cgi instead it should be practical nearly all of the heroes we've seen so far,3
5869,while it couldn't shake the feeling that this is more of the avengers with some added wrinkles,3
5870,boring at times but still a very enjoyable and fun film,3
5871,the movie isn't bad by any means but no where near the first one but it was good,3
5872,a good sequel lots of action funny and entertaining but that can't save it's overlong duration,3
5873,no moment when we think they will actually hurt or kill one of the avengers the main four by themselves could take loki,3
5874,felt like the ending was a bit underwhelming and the movie was more sillier this time around with more visual gag jokes,3
5875,as i said overall its not a great movie but it was full of some problems,3
5876,it's a more complex affair but that doesn't stop it being a fun couple of hours,3
5877,i would say that this film is much more entertaining with lots of action and fun for everyone,3
5878,paul rudd is definitely a person to cast as the ant-man series a fun if a tad slight stand-alone strand,3
5879,the film has a slightly different take on the way the previous movies were done with great pleasure,3
5880,it still was not as good as the first one and it doesn't last long and the second time is probably shorter,3
5881,2 surpasses all expectations and is far better than the last hulk movie but i wouldn't avoid it it's a good summer movie,3
5882,the fight scene on titan with thanos is the best action scene is probably the car-chase that happens mid-movie,3
5883,however this is often overshadowed with the introduction of a new rhodey was smooth,3
5884,great cast great action and a great performance from robert downey jr,3
5885,it does more of the same not that it's horrible just not as amazing as the original,3
5886,it's better than iron man 2 and not as good as guardians of the galaxy was when it really first kicked in for me,3
5887,james gunn knocked it out of the park for the second time the first time being when it just came out,3
5888,ant-man and the wasp was a little adventure with a heart of gold who is given a chance to save the world,3
5889,it does not move as fast as it should and therefore feels very wasted and like botched potential,3
5890,besides the many jokes it had heart and was a good story and mixed plot makes this movie am average one,3
5891,so to sum it up iron man 3 is guilty of that as well,3
5892,hulk is nothing special but it is still fun and action packed,3
5893,the last film in the series captain america civil war in may,3
5894,if this was one of the better ways to get stabbed,3
5895,i felt it tilted slightly on the side of a little too much in the middle of the film,3
5896,this movie is good but not good enough for hulk to be a stand alone film,3
5897,when i saw this movie i thought it was a bit boring a bit confusing and a bit underwhelming,3
5898,though this film isn't as good as i expected it to be,3
5899,i might so bold to say this is the exact definition of insanity,3
5900,there are also many parts of the film is tim roth as the villain is very intimidating and even has a little comedy to him,3
5901,replace ivan vanko with a more relatable villain and iron man 2 is not one of those wow amazing films though,3
5902,pfeiffer and douglas also steal the show but their characters don't have enough tall buildings to find to be useful,3
5903,an ok sequel but the action scenes make up for the lack of innovation with the script,3
5904,favreau once again does a great job again as tony stark,3
5905,mickey rourke is really good but this never becomes more than a yawn which is a shame since still i enjoyed pearce's performance,3
5906,this hulk movie does a very well done film by jon favreau,3
5907,and i wasn t impressed with the battle between the two sisters gamora and nebula reconciling after years of sibling rivalry,3
5908,great visuals and great performance by paul rudd and michael douglas,3
5909,it doesn't break any barriers and it doesn't last long and the second time is probably shorter,3
5910,the effects were amazing and looked awesome i wouldn't say that he's a peaceful man but you really shouldn't mess with him,3
5911,of course the first one came as more of a surprise but still successful action and humor,3
5912,5 4 2017 2 a great movie and story with a good amount of things right to make it an extremely enjoyable watch,3
5913,5 4 2017 2 a great movie and a must see,3
5914,not as fun as the first one but in the same style,3
5915,the story was interesting overall and didn't feel like a classic story like the first two,3
5916,stunningly beautiful again but lacking something that made the first volume gel so well,3
5917,not a bad movie it's about on par or as good as the first one but still plenty of entertainment,3
5918,not the best superhero films nowhere near as good as the first movie but it comes damn close,3
5919,silly and overcrowded with characters to setup for the avengers film while at the same time however moments are peculiarly mature,3
5920,and it's definitely way better than the othr one a few yrs ago,3
5921,not as good or funny than the first but still a great film thanks to downey and paltrow's chemistry,3
5922,it still had some redeeming qualities but the overall package could have been much better and i really wish norton could have stayed for avengers,3
5923,didn't like it that much because the climax is a lot of fun to be had,3
5924,even for the most dedicated fan like me this is kind of stupid and i'm getting very sick of it,3
5925,probably the most underrated film in the marvel cinematic universe and concluding the iron man trilogy,3
5926,i hoped to see king t'challa more stronger as he was in civil war but if you love marvel movies then of course you did,3
5927,forget all about the sub-plots concerned tony stark's alcoholism like in the comics,3
5928,he is not as cool as the x-men's asgard wakanda dr,3
5929,but they take up so much time of the film and it would have made iron man more popular and more in its time,3
5930,this film also introduces scarlet johanson as black widow who does a good job of being exciting without needing to be epic,3
5931,very noticeably pg-13 film with some of the star wars movies,3
5932,although this movie has less iron man and more tony stark it is cool to hear the cure and voice recognition is far from perfect,3
5933,plus he wasn't even the same whiplash from the comics he should have been whiplash in this movie,3
5934,to be honest i found myself bored a lot of the qualities we see in hero characters,3
5935,they made him into a bumbling idiot who was forcefully taken out of the equation like he was a petty thug,3
5936,infinity war doesn't feel like a marvel movie,3
5937,so who are these guardians of the galaxy but not as a stand alone film,3
5938,maybe some comic book nerds hate that but it's a very well executed marvel movie with lots of laughs and creative action sequences,3
5939,otherwise the soundtrack is a little all over the place still entertaining but the worst of the phase 3 movies,3
5940,not the best marvel movie but it's worth watching if you're bored,3
5941,guardians was a lot of fun re-watching this movie and it managed to deliver on many levels,3
5942,just as peter parker tries to figure out his powers and what exactly to do with them,3
5943,with that said it isn't as good as the first one but not quite as good the second time around,3
5944,it's an improvment on ang lee's version or the avengers's version,3
5945,but it was still a good film,3
5946,a better film than its predecessor but not quite as good as that previous movie,3
5947,as part of the marvel cinematic universe thanks to all the greatness it has within,3
5948,i'd say this was amongst the weakest of the phase 1 movies in my opinion,3
5949,paul rudd is definitely a person to cast as the ant-man just 3 out of 5 stars for entertainment value,3
5950,there are also many parts of the film robert downey jr,3
5951,still this ties in quite nicely with the avengers and edward norton plays a good part but the story is all over the place,3
5952,now i didn't like how it felt more like a henchmen than a big bad guy,3
5953,i will say it's better than the 3rd movie but that isn't saying much considering the awesomeness of the others,3
5954,the screenplay also ignores a lot of the plot points were short and wasted,3
5955,from there though it gets a little too biblical for its own good,3
5956,out of the marvel universe movies but it's certainly a good one and deserves a watch,3
5957,also i thought this film focused more on the heroes than the first ant-man so i was curious about his film well,3
5958,speaking of hawkeye he is one of the most visually-stunning movies in the mcu,3
5959,it is a good hulk the final action scene in this movie is just bad,3
5960,it just didn't appeal to me for some reason,3
5961,not as good as the others that came before it starring eric bana hulk 2003,3
5962,hints at more films to come while reshaping the foundation of the marvel cinematic universe but definitely not the weakest as well,3
5963,not one of my favorite marvel movies but still worth the price of admission alone,3
5964,i had huge expectations walking into the film and i couldn't beleive it when i saw it,3
5965,iron man 2 certainly isn't the finest outing in the marvel cinematic universe then,3
5966,they all are defined by the fact that the film is without flaws,3
5967,also the relationship between liv tyler's betty ross however occurs almost abruptly,3
5968,the second villain sonny burch is by no means the disaster that it should have been a tough role for her,3
5969,not all of the jokes landed for me,3
5970,despite being noticeably less enjoyable than the three other marvel movies this is one of the most explosive marvel movies ever made,3
5971,overall black panther was good not great but good and entertaining,3
5972,the villain is pretty generic and we don't need antoher one like him but we do,3
5973,likewise in this case which is fine but it's not a bad thing,3
5974,the way thanos so easily gets some of the infinity stones and he is in a body of water,3
5975,yet despite a few minor flaws spider-man homecoming isn't the best one ever made,3
5976,simply put ant-man is quite strong,3
5977,i would say they tried with this movie but it was just good,3
5978,summarizing my thoughts this was a wildly inconsistent entry in the mcu but it had all the charm of the first,3
5979,chadwick boseman is by far the best in the series but not the worst,3
5980,overall it was a good film with a charming performance by paul rudd and michael douglas,3
5981,the incredible hulk was a pretty good spider-man movie,3
5982,i felt like i was in a video game the whole movie and it's a shame,3
5983,they all are defined by the fact that the film is all about iron man for better and for worse,3
5984,i will say it's better than the 2003 hulk,3
5985,marvel's the avengers is now one of the most remarkable comebacks in cinematic history,3
5986,a definitive improvement over its predecessor but still doesn't quite match the plot of the original but seems a bit less focused,3
5987,as his performance is quite contemplative and subdued he doesn't make the movie bad this is a great movie and robert downey jr,3
5988,while starlord is bonding with daddy we do get a lot more of parker amongst his young high school buddies,3
5989,funny with some emotional scenes and in my opinion just as good as age of ultron but that's possibly not saying much,3
5990,this movie is good but not good enough to erase the unreal prior battle,3
5991,deeming this the strongest hulk film ever made is sort of a weak link in the marvel universe,3
5992,once again delivers a superb soundtrack but i couldn't escape the feeling it was moving too fast to me to keep up with it,3
5993,the action here is pretty good but not as good as the first one,3
5994,not the best marvel movie but it's very nice to see,3
5995,this latest entry in the marvel cinematic universe with some of the guardians joining in late,3
5996,it's almost more of a heist comedy film this is the one for you,3
5997,approached by hope van dyne evangeline lily a,3
5998,however it was a pretty generic movie don't get me wrong there's plenty wrong with iron man 2,3
5999,they are going to incorporate this into avengers 2 but better than the second but lower than the first,3
6000,i personally prefer the first one but still a solid entry in the marvel series,3
6001,the hulk does a good job as the latest incarnation of peter parker spider-man in films at least since 2002,3
6002,the only real issues that i had with the film was that it acted as a prequel to the avengers then a iron man sequel,3
6003,golum aka andy serkis was great sucks he won't be in the new hulk movies that are sure to come,3
6004,of the films i've seen in years that seems to be going through the motions forgettable but okay,3
6005,don't get me wrong it was good but e movie was unnecessary,3
6006,probably the weakest of the series but still very watchable,3
6007,not a great film and a great way to avoid another spider-man reboot,3
6008,not quite up to the standards of the first installment but the jokes are as laughable and cool as the previous,3
6009,overall it's a fun movie if your a fan of the other marvel movies to enjoy it,3
6010,tom holland was good as peter parker and spider-man 2 came out in 2004 and still holds up well with downey jr,3
6011,it certainly does not live up to their job description by saving the galaxy,3
6012,the action is awesome and robert downey jr is brilliant in delivering those lines,3
6013,the only things i found wrong with age of ultron is a great movie-night rental,3
6014,sad to say this does not match up to the first movie but this payoff does not work,3
6015,yet all in all it is a film that isn't quite up to par with its predecessor,3
6016,another really good marvel movie that comic book fans should see it,3
6017,it's enjoyable once you look past the writing and i'm sure to some people one of the worst,3
6018,and really a big part of this movie,3
6019,i actually don't have as much action sequences and is boring but that's not what i do,3
6020,that was a good scene but not good enough for the characters sake,3
6021,this film tried too hard to be relevant for the story,3
6022,some of the simple dialogue scenes with all of the hype i was really expecting a better superhero movie,3
6023,this movie is good but definetly not the best marvel movie i've watched so far but definitely entertaining,3
6024,he found holland to be likeable in the role and i liked his interaction with the kid,3
6025,while not marvel's best effort the incredible hulk is one of the most disappointing marvel movies but still worth the price of admission,3
6026,the action sequences are cool and the fighting ispossibly some of the best action the mcu has to offer,3
6027,a decent follow up to the terrific iron man iron man 2 is an unfortunate misfire for marvel,3
6028,loved tom holland as spider-man and the wasp is a sequel to the last avengers,3
6029,this was a good movie but not great,3
6030,bit of a dead fish when it comes to the humor it's 50 50,3
6031,not as great as i expected but still a good movie but it had nothing special just your generic superhero action movie,3
6032,wish ronan was more like his character in the movie and in future films,3
6033,this time round there was no real context nor character development,3
6034,although this movie has less iron man and more tony stark it is cool to hear the cure and voice recognition is far from perfect,3
6035,i was entertained and most of the jokes landed and were delivered perfectly,3
6036,maybe some comic book nerds hate that but it's a good movie but just a bad villian,3
6037,the inventive nature of phase one is overshadowed by the need to return the characters to their initial states,3
6038,i just wish the story itself was on the same level as the campy tobey maguire films,3
6039,it was enjoyable but really didn't have anything to do with the original iron man but robert downing jr,3
6040,not as good as the first one but just a tad,3
6041,but i was expecting big things the first time around as i'm not a fan of the marvel universe,3
6042,thanos cant save this from being a terrific spider-man story,3
6043,better than the last trash hulk movie to come out in theatres it looks unsurprisinly amazing,3
6044,we had just met him and he was hardly in the movie,3
6045,while a definite improvement over its predecessor iron man still delivers a refreshing clever and action-packed the cgi is brilliant,3
6046,the villain obadiah is pure evil i just don't like or care for vision paul bettany,3
6047,i appreciated this one better than the original as i haven't watched it you should and if you have doubts you shouldn't,3
6048,however because of this at times the movie felt like it was missing in 3,3
6049,i was not as much of a fan about the plot of the original but i feel like they were trying to make it funnier,3
6050,enjoyed this a good action flick but didn't quite live up to the hype of its predecessor but is a competent sequel,3
6051,it's a fun time but don't have your expectations too high,3
6052,2 is only 11 minutes longer than its predecessor but it could have been a lot better too,3
6053,probably the weakest of the recent marvel movies but it's not a really great movie but i had a lot of fun,3
6054,kingsley was in the midst of it all,3
6055,he said homecoming is the kind of power he has,3
6056,i mean i like spider-man i grew up with,3
6057,perhaps when there's so much setup so much learn and so much to keep up with the banter you won't much care,3
6058,a movie on its own in my opinion the movie could have been better,3
6059,the third instalment of the iron man films of which the first was easily the best in the film,3
6060,if this was one of the greatest mcu movies to date,3
6061,not up to the heights of the first iron man,3
6062,it was enjoyable but really didn't have anything to do with the avengers we saw back in 2012,3
6063,not the best super hero movie to date but that isn't exactly the focus of this film,3
6064,though ant-man and the wasp 3 out of 5,3
6065,just not as good as the movie could have been better under edgar wright,3
6066,i liked ant-man and the wasp would be a must see after infinity war and the change of pace was welcomed,3
6067,it was greatly done character driven movie in a superhero movie like this with downey jr,3
6068,then it was way to many characters used in the movie but overall a good action-driven spectacle that fans will enjoy,3
6069,the witty rhetoric throughout and the story as a whole is bland since that city is full of personality and life,3
6070,i feel like this movie did not suck,3
6071,despite not being quite on the level of avengers 1 or 3,3
6072,not the strongest mcu movie but still a good fun time to be had at the theaters,3
6073,the villains are perhaps the least memorable of the trilogy but don't let that spoil what is fun in this movie,3
6074,overall ant-man is the best,3
6075,uneven pacing keeps this from being one of marvel's most memorable villains but the character just does nothing for me here,3
6076,good but not as good as the first but still worth seeing,3
6077,there are times when it would have been nice to see sampson,3
6078,also it was funny the first one or many of the other marvel films,3
6079,it is similar in tone to iron man 1 but it's not bad,3
6080,the story was great but it was also hit-and-miss,3
6081,this film has all the same issues from the first movie and the plot is somewhat sketchy,3
6082,all in all enjoyable but not one of the best characters in the movie,3
6083,still it is a decent sequel that delivers very few great action sequences and a better villain would've made me rate this film higher,3
6084,the end credit was really funny and i was happy with edward norton's performance and with tim roth's also,3
6085,very entertaining super hero movie but didn't quite live up to the first iteration,3
6086,very well done but not as good as the first film but it wasn't bad,3
6087,i never felt that it was the russo brothers directing,3
6088,needless to say this is the best one so far,3
6089,this movie is fun and had some great moments but it doesn't really do much more than that however,3
6090,all in all it's a pretty good time nonetheless,3
6091,more hulk smash action than the ang lee version of the hulk and this one is no exception,3
6092,and of course there are going to be absolutely pissed with the character twist in the movie and didn't feel like a marvel movie,3
6093,not at all but for me this film had the burden of answering the question then what,3
6094,not enough care was put into the details of the film despite him being the primary artist in charge of the film,3
6095,the only thing i liked about this movie there was a tribe that literally act like monkeys,3
6096,the next film in the marvel cinematic universe films owned by disney,3
6097,i don't wanna say it kills the movie because it doesn't really feel like a real threat,3
6098,new characters are introduced to and for me this is what i come up with as fun as the first,3
6099,boring disjointed and afraid to step out of his comfort zone in the suburbs where his webs don't have enough screen time to apprecite,3
6100,while awesome to see spidey back in the mcu where at least the whole world is not at stake,3
6101,that constant sense of a shared landscape long a cornerstone of the comic book movies but it turnout to be the same,3
6102,funny movie but mostly because of groot because well groot,3
6103,this movie was not just when compared to the marvel cinematic universe film,3
6104,and where in the world is going on,3
6105,only let downs for me were paltrow of whom i can't stand how most guys enjoy watching this kinda movie,3
6106,luis introduces him to the rest of the film watching that unfold,3
6107,the bulk of the plot revolves around her and her parents to the point where the loud humor is almost too stupid and relentless,3
6108,and it's one of the most visually-stunning movies in the mcu but still lacks almost everything that makes a great sequel,3
6109,the villain could have been a much better movie than it actually is it's still pretty great,3
6110,brand me a racist if you want i can't say i ever truly bought into edward norton as the hulk,3
6111,1st some of james spader's threatening performance,3
6112,iron man 2 is still overshadowed by the original due to it's muddled production is unheard of,3
6113,we here at filmgrades can't wait to see ant-man in future marvel films,3
6114,the powers that be thought it would be but it wasn't as good as the first one but still pretty good,3
6115,what they did with some of the choices made for character,3
6116,this was fun it was quick and you don't know how much that pissed me right off,3
6117,tony stark is a dismissive jerk and this time it's like the first avengers,3
6118,the avengers is the first team-up film in the mcu's avengers franchise and was directed by jon watts,3
6119,like many superhero movies iron man 3 falls flat as a superhero movie solid with some great elements but also pacing issues,3
6120,his performance is solid and he does a fine job at entertaining with funny quips and charming actors and visual panache,3
6121,not really my favorite of the three but i can't help but to treat everything like it's a joke,3
6122,i found the movie entertaining but by no means a guardians of the galaxy but it still offered some fun moments,3
6123,the character development and conflict that stark goes in this movie is one of the most engaging villains to grace the marvel canon before loki,3
6124,in fact i can say that i have finally watched all the marvel cinematic universe but definitely not the weakest as well,3
6125,this movie lost the magic of the first one was still there it was not as bad as i was told,3
6126,this film is directed by louis leterrier who does a decent job is not very likable unfortunately,3
6127,at this point wash rinse and repeat scenario in my opinion,3
6128,while i don't enjoy superhero movies i had to watch the trailer again to recall seeing it,3
6129,in all i enjoyed my time with this movie but it was just the fact that the first hour is boring,3
6130,ant-man and the wasp has a lot of action to this movie and funny parts,3
6131,you can obsess over it for political reasons or whatever as a superhero movie solid with some great elements but also pacing issues,3
6132,the acting is good and the action scenes are really only what i like about the movie,3
6133,a good action flick but didn't quite get paul rudd,3
6134,the only reason falcon is in the movie is good but not great,3
6135,the movie had a really good storyline it also had a lot of fun with iron man 3,3
6136,i wouldn't say that he's a part of the avengers,3
6137,ed norton is the perfect choice for ant-man who can be done well,3
6138,needless to say this is the exact same thing as before but with a different villain,3
6139,o my epic is all i can say is their are two credit scenes,3
6140,he really shows why he is one of the most explosive marvel movies ever made,3
6141,but there's no denying that this is a huge step down from the first avengers film but it is in no way incredible,3
6142,the mid-credits sequence is a weird tonal shift from the rest of the film especially one intended for youthful audiences,3
6143,not the best marvel movie ever made in infinity war,3
6144,following the battle of new york adrian toomes michael keaton and his men as they salvage chituari technology,3
6145,a few more things i liked about ant-man was secondary to her and hank,3
6146,at least modern family's ty burrell is in this movie though i don't think that it was cgi,3
6147,this on the other hand there is not a lot of logic with fun popcorn movie action,3
6148,i for one didn't leave guardians of the galaxy at least attempts to step out of the marvel cookie cutter,3
6149,however it is better the the stupid fantastic four movies and the first hulk movie better because it's more realistic,3
6150,in an honest opinion not the best iron man of the trilogy so far,3
6151,but it is a good hulk movie better than the ang lee version of the hulk and this one is no exception,3
6152,the film also feels less like a film and more on setting up future instalments of the franchise,3
6153,i like ironman but i was not invested in the story and some of the characters banter,3
6154,this angry mcu reboot boasts great action amp cgi within the course of the film as a friendly neighborhood spider-man,3
6155,sympathetic villain like erik killmonger is great but the villains here are weakly layered and poorly executed,3
6156,i felt the villain especially was quite lacking felt more like a comedy than part of the mcu,3
6157,you can see that he's a part of the avengers,3
6158,2 instead offers a more personal heartfelt narrative over it's predecessor and a more enjoyable version as well,3
6159,i thought all of the actors are back and the film is a visual spectacle full of colours,3
6160,there are no emotional stakes in this movie that should have meant a lot but it was not supposed to be,3
6161,a pretty good sequel and just as good as the first movie but i do admit that it feels very disjointed,3
6162,i actually liked it more than the first ant-man so i was curious about his film well,3
6163,and the thing is it was finally a good version of the incredible hulk has incredible fight scenes and a solid introduction tobruce banner,3
6164,some great moments but got a little too big for their own boots,3
6165,it's a more complex affair but that doesn't go anywhere until winter soldier,3
6166,the cgi is flimsy in areas and the plot is all over the place,3
6167,while this sequel doesn't feel quite as magical as the first film but lacking its charm and it elements presented are unnecessary forgettable,3
6168,other than that it felt like a super hero tag game,3
6169,mild spoilers so much happened in this movie that it felt like it was missing in 3,3
6170,his character the vision was definitely one of the better ways to get stabbed,3
6171,i never felt that it was the russo brothers directing,3
6172,the incredible hulk proves to be a good movie with some very good character moments and a good storytelling and narrative,3
6173,as well i keep forgetting that this movie is not as good as the first,3
6174,this would be 4 stars aside from it sagging a little too much sam rockwell's character is a little ridiculous etc,3
6175,by far better then the more recent hulk film but it is fun and works within the inner logic of the series,3
6176,a funny and thrilling movie with great special effects and cool graphics used throughout including on ghost the antagonist,3
6177,things i didn't like it as much as the first one but still pretty damn good,3
6178,maybe i'm just too much of a follow-up,3
6179,replace ivan vanko with a more relatable villain and iron man 2 tried too hard to succeed but it ultimately fails,3
6180,it's definitely head and shoulders above iron man 2 but is missing some more action,3
6181,taken as a whole this is a very good choice to play the title character but it's a well made film,3
6182,but they made it and after seeing it i've to say that i believe this is a good movie once again,3
6183,paul rudd's scott lang faces the consequences of his choices as both a superhero and a father,3
6184,an improvement to the first ant-man and the wasp was enjoyable,3
6185,there's nothing in this film that is really cringeworthy,3
6186,and it was very cgi heavy but all in all not as good as age of ultron except that movie has a better finale,3
6187,not as complete as the first one but guardians of the galaxy vol,3
6188,i was thinking on rather to give this 3 stars or 3 and a half is the villain darren cross is pretty meh,3
6189,there is a good cgi lot of laughs and cool action and even a solid villain,3
6190,it's as fun as the first one but it still is decent,3
6191,this one happens to be more enjoyable and funny than the first but still a great offering in the iron man trilogy,3
6192,well the movie certainly has some good action as well as character development but a little overlong,3
6193,i thought it was going to be but it wasn't bad but could've been better,3
6194,not the best super hero movie to date but that's not a bad movie but a pretty big disappointment,3
6195,celestials don't need to be in film,3
6196,he praised holland as terrific and well-cast as well as the ability the script has to poke fun at itself,3
6197,while it may lack in depth or even character development the incredible hulk is such a vast improvement from the previous movie,3
6198,however i realized that this was a bit of a rocky start for the comic book company,3
6199,we also get to see scott lang becoming ant-man and the wasp serves as another worthy addition to the marvel world,3
6200,it does more of the same from the first ant-man imo more fun and less cringe for me,3
6201,my problem was the main villain but at times i have a hard time meshing them together,3
6202,as a film it is better than the avengers but as a whole it is certainly not the worst film in the marvel universe,3
6203,marvel's sequel to one of the freshest comic book films in a long time in action cinema,3
6204,fourthly the hulk he didn't get much of a origin story,3
6205,the cast is great too such as mickey rourke as ivan vanko whiplash even if the character isn't true to the comics,3
6206,they did pretty good juggling so many characters and has a worthy but cliched villain,3
6207,action scenes are really well developed but just like the other characters in this movie have either nothing to do or are just bad,3
6208,ant-man and this one was on the same level as iron man or civil war prepare to be disappointed,3
6209,after the tone and events of infinity war seemed like it wouldn't work,3
6210,its attempts to get you to care about the characters or get invested in the story,3
6211,however despite its minor flaws iron man 3 was a better film than iron man 2 which failed in many different ways,3
6212,not as crisp as the first outing but still an entertaining addition that does not stray to far from the formula,3
6213,the story felt forced i didn't care about giving the character any depth at all,3
6214,she was one of the many boring put together ones and a lot of fun moments sprinkled about,3
6215,fun fast paced and creative ant-man is another solid entry to the mcu and homage to the superhero icon,3
6216,not as crisp as the first outing but still an entertaining addition that does not stray to far from the formula,3
6217,if spider-man homecoming is a great film about tony stark and iron man,3
6218,trying too hard to go for the same laughs of the first film but lacking its charm and it elements presented are unnecessary forgettable,3
6219,a fumbled attempt at what would've been a much more accurate title,3
6220,finally the use of jackson as nick fury is a perfect casting decision,3
6221,he is estranged from his ex-wife doesn t understand him,3
6222,while still a good movie but not great,3
6223,nothing new to add to the mcu cast,3
6224,which is pretty much what you d expect from a marvel film like the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
6225,this isn't a good film it's not up with everything else,3
6226,ant-man is a fun and decent addition to the mcu but it had all the charm of the first,3
6227,i also think the last 40 minutes of the film the little kid in me was chomping at the bit,3
6228,whilst i agree with ed norton that this could have been the greatest action movie ever,3
6229,not as goodthis is an entertaining film but it lacks in good storytelling and actingrating 70 %,3
6230,good but not as good as the first film and has some genuinely heartfelt moments,3
6231,it's lost the novel sheen of its predecessor and not quite meeting the same bar on wit and intrigue,3
6232,and better than iron man 2 and thor the dark world or captain america the winter soldier,3
6233,it might not be the complete movie but as an mcu event the culmination of ten years of filmmaking that has a remarkably ambitious vision,3
6234,he is not as cool as the x-men's asgard wakanda dr,3
6235,the way thanos so easily gets some of the infinity stones and he is in a body of water,3
6236,i personally prefer the first one but rdj still is the heart of the film and nothing is significantly affected,3
6237,the sides stories feel more interesting than the character otherwise could have been,3
6238,so to sum it up iron man 3 is so different from the first two,3
6239,seen it three times now and still holds up and looks better than the last trash hulk movie to come out,3
6240,what they did with some of the best action of the film,3
6241,my only issue is that it could never reach the heights of one of the best movies i've seen,3
6242,definitely the weakest of all marvel movies so far black panther won't let you down,3
6243,i actually liked it more than the first one in multiple facets but not without it's flaws,3
6244,i love the hulk as a character but missing his former state too,3
6245,1st some of james spader's threatening performance,3
6246,however the action and cg were very strong and the acting was once again strong,3
6247,iron man 2 certainly isn't the finest outing in the marvel cinematic universe,3
6248,a dark story about a dark character the incredible hulk tells the story of bruce banner,3
6249,you know what you're thinking it's a marvel movie so it had to be done,3
6250,not really my side of the marvel universe in the future,3
6251,not the best sequel in the mcu since iron man 2,3
6252,tim roth's character is terrible before he turns into the hulk a green 10-foot monster of uncontrollable rage,3
6253,it does not move as fast as it should and therefore feels very wasted and like botched potential,3
6254,at the time and this was prior to civil war i gave it a whirl,3
6255,paul rudd is one of my favorite marvel movies but still a good catch hehe,3
6256,yet despite a few weaknesses avengers infinity war is well directed well acted and pretty well done,3
6257,a good movie but it could be a nice movie if it wasn't for moivepass r,3
6258,iron man 2 lacks the adrenaline and swagger of the first entry but above the overstuffed but still enjoyable second,3
6259,i thought the movie was good not great,3
6260,the humour felt forced and the visuals were weak for the first half or so and william hurt is pretty good,3
6261,i was hoping for the magic of the first by injecting way too much humor which is such a waste of talent,3
6262,not as strong as its predecessor iron man 3 still had it's humor and action but without ac dc music,3
6263,like many superhero movies iron man 3 falls flat as a superhero movie i think there are many better ones out there,3
6264,a much better use of the character in a film released a year earlier,3
6265,boys liked it i was just not a huge fan of the first one so wasn't let down by this,3
6266,more clever then the first one but it just didn't work for me,3
6267,i was excited to see this and the acting is very sub standard for actors of this caliber,3
6268,i don't have the same appeal as the first which was too long and plagued with too much talking,3
6269,the screenplay also ignores a lot of the qualities we see in hero characters,3
6270,that man is edward norton who does a great job playing the character of emil blonsky as well,3
6271,another film which just didn't click with me the way i thought it would be at least a great movie,3
6272,definitely not my favorite marvel movie but its not a great movie,3
6273,the fight with war machine and black widow are introduced horribly,3
6274,i liked it but not as good as the first one,3
6275,first of all the villan was really good at the beginning of the film and is great in every scene,3
6276,it might not be the complete movie but as an mcu event the culmination of ten years of filmmaking that has a remarkably ambitious vision,3
6277,to me it isn't as good as the first one but rdj still is the heart of the movie,3
6278,it's not perfect and has a controversial twist but it's still decent enough to be entertaining,3
6279,while starlord is bonding with daddy we do get a lot more of parker amongst his young high school buddies,3
6280,on top of that the film is titled avengers age of ultron is the second feature film in the mcu,3
6281,what this means exactly is that the movie is trying to comment about,3
6282,ant-man and the wasp is by no means the masterpiece it is regarded as,3
6283,the last film in the series captain america civil war and force him into helping them nab janet from oblivion,3
6284,iron man 2 is not as good as the original but still a good catch hehe,3
6285,it tells a nice tale about family and friendship but a few of the characters are really cliche oh a girl who can punch,3
6286,ugh what can i say i finally watched the avengers and it has a forgettable villain and is a forgettable movie overall,3
6287,the antagonist in this movie is never fully explained even in a way that was perfectly spader,3
6288,would definitely recommend but does not live up to any other of the marvel movies team,3
6289,i like paul rudd and in his role as ego with the rest of the film,3
6290,infused with tons of traditional culture it was a bit of a scrawny kid,3
6291,is a very entertaining film but inferior to the first in many ways gotg2 is still a very fun movie,3
6292,i said ant man and the wasp is that the film takes itself perhaps a bit too seriously,3
6293,having said that i enjoyed the movie but i get why they did that but this movie is still alot of fun,3
6294,i tend to consider superhero movies as a genre in itself and this one was on the same level as the campy tobey maguire films,3
6295,not the strongest mcu movie but still a good movie to watch even though it can be boring at times,3
6296,as i mentioned the last 45 minutes of the movie aren't developed at all and even look cliched,3
6297,you felt his presence every time he was on screen i didn't question it,3
6298,in the end though while everything in this film isn't as good as the previous avengers movie,3
6299,ant-man and the wasp is a fun sequel that has villain and stakes problems,3
6300,it just feels like more of the same well but the plot and the villain are dull and disappointing,3
6301,solid film but could have been done with this antagonist,3
6302,bottomline even though nortons acting was awful everything else was good in this as well with the mandarin stuff,3
6303,it's not a bad movie but it's not too bad and i would watch it again,3
6304,this would emotionally invest the audience more when it comes to the interactions between the characters and their connections,3
6305,that awesome final battle at the end is great but the rest of the movie was fun amp cool like the 1st one,3
6306,regardless it's a good movie but it couldn't break free of the weight of it's own direction,3
6307,as a whole i really enjoyed the movie due to the heavy criticism throughout this review,3
6308,i did not expect it to be as good as its predecessor but it is a worthy sequel and a very enjoyable movie to watch,3
6309,relied on some easy camera setups and framing where it could have been a perfect reason for captain america civil war,3
6310,probably my favorite super movie since guardians of the galaxy or iron man caliber but still very entertaining with some very cool action moments,3
6311,i'm not gon na say that i didn't like it as much as the character does,3
6312,2 only 2 out of 5 cast points,3
6313,well it's pretty okay but it's definitely not as good as the first avengers,3
6314,but anyways the movie was good but it wasn't as good as avengers infinity war or as groundbreaking as black panther,3
6315,nothing wrong with that but it always tends to come across as scary and only vaguely intimidates,3
6316,like its lead performance the incredible hulk is decent enough and turns out to be fairly minor,3
6317,making a hulk movie is probably one of the best characters in the movie,3
6318,does their second outing together live up to the original like toy story,3
6319,did not live up to iron man or the dark knight,3
6320,if not for iron man this would have been had wright remained the director,3
6321,don't get me wrong the action and cgi dumb down the story,3
6322,the climax is a bit of a strange choice dr,3
6323,michael pena was very funny as a supporting character in the future marvel films,3
6324,was a good movie but not the best they've done,3
6325,regardless it's a good movie with a very charming lead from paul rudd,3
6326,but it's fun it keeps you interested and is still worth watching,3
6327,the avengers was my favorite superhero movie but still good,3
6328,with the attempts to wrangle a sophisticated narrative out of iron man 3 is set in the aftermath of that film,3
6329,it seemed like a replication of the first movie fun to watch but just missed the mark,3
6330,not nearly as good as the first it's still a fun time to be had,3
6331,but it's fun it keeps you interested and is still worth watching,3
6332,a couple of them took me out of the experience or rubbed me the wrong way,3
6333,a joyful comedy romp that is nowhere near as good as the original but still fun in its own right,3
6334,the introduction of don cheadle was also a plus for this film and i have dropped my rating to a 3,3
6335,i didn't enjoy this one as much as the first one and a bit more unlogic,3
6336,yet despite a few minor flaws spider-man homecoming is a great film about tony stark and iron man,3
6337,in the end this film is just good harmless fun,3
6338,movie was decent but clearly nowhere near the greatness of the first and the fun of the second iron man film but not horrible,3
6339,this movie was entertaining but not as good as the first film or some of the other marvel installments it is a solid 3,3
6340,the villain was alright but there wasn't enough time to get attached,3
6341,it's almost more of a heist movie with a man the size of an ant,3
6342,i enjoyed the first movie but not quiet as good as the 1st movie,3
6343,i also feel the anxiety is handled excellently in the first half seem inconsequential to the second half,3
6344,all-in-all ant-man is one in which my interest level was super low,3
6345,sequelitus is doing the work here but it's still decent enough to be entertaining,3
6346,i remember having so much fun watching the first movie but i do admit that it feels very disjointed,3
6347,while not the worst movie in the mcu with a lot of action with a bit of a villain problem,3
6348,not as good as the original spiderman but nowhere as bad as the avengersbut atleast its watchable,3
6349,as to be expected and the movie did make me laugh a fair bit with some good action scenes,3
6350,the sides stories feel more interesting than the character otherwise could have been,3
6351,5 years later and the dark knight at the same time ha,3
6352,had trouble getting over the fact that this was a big deal to peter but i don't get it,3
6353,meh i loved the first one but overall it's an entertaining watch,3
6354,this is the weirdest film i've seen in the last couple weeks this one would rate third,3
6355,letitia wright did a great job with it,3
6356,this movie is the story line was kinda just the same old comic book character story with those same cliches,3
6357,also would like to see a new hulk movie much better odds,3
6358,ruffalo is still the best superhero movie i've seen just about every one of them,3
6359,after all the movies they have created so far it's not as good as the first but it still gives some good action scenes,3
6360,the first movie was good but it wasn't a waste but it was not on the level of other superhero films,3
6361,but i did find this movie to be more colorful than exciting or humorous,3
6362,although it doesn't reach the heights of the first iron man to which it does not,3
6363,i felt the villain especially was quite lacking felt more like a comedy than part of the mcu,3
6364,from great villain casting to amazing battles this movie had a lot of room for improvement but at the end of the film,3
6365,he's already been spider-man for a couple of hours nothing special,3
6366,despite the possibility that guardians may be the weakest of the mcu films due to the twist regarding the mandarin,3
6367,a substantially better version then it's predecessor and when it focuses on developing that idea it excels,3
6368,also and spoilers for a movie that has to accommodate an estimated 76 characters it was pretty good for action scenes from what i remember,3
6369,quick review guardians of the galaxy by calling it the best marvel movie not just iron man,3
6370,was a good film not the best marvel film made to this date,3
6371,we also get to see scott lang becoming ant-man and the vulture out of this movie so as not to alienate any audience,3
6372,some issues with the plot some issues with the plot some issues with the plot some issues with the villain s,3
6373,marvel has finally made the avengers and it has a very timely subject matter,3
6374,iron man 2 is not as good as the first movie but i do want to say that i loved the ending,3
6375,i know this isn't a bad movie,3
6376,avengers age of ultron is more of the same not that it's horrible just not as amazing as the original,3
6377,the movies saving pros are johanssen and cheadle who is a much better adaptation then ang lee's piece of poo from tears ago,3
6378,i remember going to see the first iron man iron man who does magic and iron spider,3
6379,a worthy sequel though it may not live up to the first iron man,3
6380,i would have given it only 3 stars if it wasn't meant to tie into the mcu,3
6381,it's nothing you haven't seen the dark knight,3
6382,the guardians movies just seem to have a problem putting down the us,3
6383,not as good as the first movie but i do want to say that i loved the ending,3
6384,not the best marvel movie but the incredible hulk is an underwhelming anticlimactic adaptation of marvel's hulk,3
6385,in terms of content avengers age of ultron feels focused more on what's to come which now that the avengers is out is dated,3
6386,some issues with the plot some issues with the plot some issues with the villain s,3
6387,one of the problems i had with the original ant-man,3
6388,even when i watched the avengers for the first time and it doesn't get the flame of approval but a fun watch regardless,3
6389,the three stars is for the fun of the second iron man film but not horrible,3
6390,iron man 2 is definitely not as good as the original but still a fun movie,3
6391,kurt russel's character was too much and the end of the day though the problem with iron man 2,3
6392,it shows him as a 15 year old kid who doesn't really care much for it hear,3
6393,however the action and cg were very strong and the acting was once again strong,3
6394,wasn't a huge fan of the first one has far and away become its strength,3
6395,as the status of a marvel fan i'd definitely recommend infinity war,3
6396,a lot of potential in it the same way as the captain america and thor leading in the 2012 release of the avengers,3
6397,it's completely elegant it's bafflingly beautiful and it's capable of busting a bunker under the bunker you just busted,3
6398,there is some weird editing throughout the film that had me go i'm sorry what,3
6399,not the best superhero movie i've seen but still enjoyable,3
6400,the villain is good but the story is boring some of the jokes and drax was annoying in this one,3
6401,the air force one free-fall scene was really fun to watch and ed norton has enough acting skills to play anything,3
6402,this movie just doesn't do enough to stand out and with so many comic book films the stakes are too high,3
6403,the storyline was a tad bit boring but i've come to expect do not by any means stand in the way of the drama,3
6404,ant-man and the wasp aren't going to kill our heroes anyway,3
6405,a good sequel lots of action funny and entertaining but not big fan of the marcel cinematic universe antman didn't resonate with me,3
6406,way better than the first or the third installment,3
6407,tom holland also proves that he was the man for the role,3
6408,iron man 2 isn't the cast they're fantastic and it isn't the strongest but there is a lot of fun,3
6409,truly it's his interactions with the supporting cast playing his high school peers,3
6410,it's not great like the original but it isn't until he's brought to life in the movie that are boring,3
6411,the hulk on the flip side of that argument while some scenes such as the church scene were horrifically edited and were done extremely poorly,3
6412,iron man 2 is not as good as avengers infinity war but still isn't a bad viewing,3
6413,tim blake nelson is here and he's quite funny and entertaining but that can't save it's overlong duration,3
6414,much better than the first iron man stick out to me,3
6415,uneven pacing keeps this from being one of marvel's most memorable villains but the character just does nothing for me here,3
6416,the cgi on the hulk is far better than the reviews and comments led me to believe it would be,3
6417,although this movie has less iron man and more tony stark it is cool to hear the cure and voice recognition is far from perfect,3
6418,the pros outweigh the cons for sure but it's the good kind of dumb,3
6419,the film which kickstarted the marvel cinematic universe this is the second film in the mcu but it's still pretty awesome,3
6420,and it was very cgi heavy but all in all not as good as the first movie,3
6421,ant-man and the wasp is that the film takes itself perhaps a bit too seriously,3
6422,entertaining but one of the weakest of the series but still good,3
6423,three easily comes out as the best of the franchise they should probably skip the incredible hulk,3
6424,when marvel started to show the world how to make a good hulk film and honestly i don't think this movie is bad,3
6425,we've seen black panther in civil war and gets played out quickly in this film but that tragedy needs humour to balance it,3
6426,a potentially powerful story had it not been a marvel property in recent history that hasn't been done before,3
6427,and by no mistake does that mean the film is bad by any means but it didn't feel that important to me,3
6428,iron man 3 is a bit of a strange choice dr,3
6429,i mostly recommend you watch this film when you haven't invested much in it that irritation becomes dangerously off-putting,3
6430,downey jr is still perfect in the role but this movie isn't terrible,3
6431,the storytelling could have a lot of fun with some great performances and visuals,3
6432,while aimless to a fault guardians of the galaxy was when it really first kicked in for me,3
6433,who will later be the villain in avengers infinity war an epic action-packed adventure that brings spider-man back,3
6434,i'll probably watch the next one thought as i am sure there is going to be important come avengers 4,3
6435,the final battle felt a bit like the last one but still not as good as the first one,3
6436,it's ok but the reason it's not as fresh as the first one did,3
6437,it was okay i enjoyed the first movie but it was an enjoyable ride,3
6438,plus the villain of the film was just meh to me,3
6439,good but not as good as other mcu moives,3
6440,the first film was not very good but this film is vital to the future of the marvel cinematic universe,3
6441,add a great story and a lovable cast and interesting premise to match,3
6442,they've directed amazing action sequences but yeah it's not the finest film in the marvel cinematic universe,3
6443,i give paul rudd and his portrayal of the ant-man he does just fine he brings his charm and humor to the role,3
6444,age of ultron is still a fun ride at the movies,3
6445,160714 some fun to be had with ant-man and the wasp a little bit harder than i intended,3
6446,too many quips often take away from the actual antagonist of tony himself,3
6447,this angry mcu reboot boasts great action amp cgi within the course of the movie he keeps his promises and there are some funny moments,3
6448,iron man 2 is still highly exciting with great action sequences and some humorous moments to make this ride worth while,3
6449,that's not to say it's a bad movie but it just wasn't as strong,3
6450,truly it's his interactions with the supporting cast playing his high school peers,3
6451,it's not great like the original but it isn't the worst marvel movie though,3
6452,but this leads to predictability with the other characters but it didn't feel that important to me,3
6453,don cheadle does his part in iron man 3 and i think the hulk is best left to a supporting role like in the avengers,3
6454,i don't know why i'm giving it 3 1 2 stars it definitely has some scientific flaws but it's definitely not bad,3
6455,hopefully they will do better in the next one and leave out the racism,3
6456,par for the course compared to iron man 2 but is missing some more action,3
6457,and the scenes where he saves peter kind of ruined the intensity of the mcu ant-man remains at home during his house arrest,3
6458,if you're a fan of the tony stark super suit,3
6459,downey jr is still perfect in the role but his character was virtually nothing,3
6460,downey jr is yet again tony stark so that's all you need to know all in around 1 to 3 minutes,3
6461,it's not even iron man 1 but better than iron man 2,3
6462,it's another necessary stepping stone in the marvel universe the incredible hulk is an early and ultimately forgettable mcu addition,3
6463,it may provide more action but doesn't take itself seriously but is a serious piece of the greater mcu,3
6464,however it is overcrowded and serves more as a commercial for the mcu or future tony stark avengers films,3
6465,as usual the action sequences were very enjoyable and i still think that it is,3
6466,only let downs for me were paltrow of whom i can't stand how most guys enjoy watching this kinda movie,3
6467,i was hoping for the magic of the first one was a masterpiece this is just ok,3
6468,even though it's not like the sequel to the movie that kick started the mcu was very political,3
6469,i get it we all love the music in this movie but there is plenty of conflict,3
6470,it shows him as a 15 year old kid who doesn't really care much for it hear,3
6471,im sure im in the minority but i really didn't think this film would be bigger than it looked,3
6472,josh whedon has already announced that he won't be returning for avengers 3,3
6473,if you loved iron man you will definitely enjoy this movie but nothing more,3
6474,yes finally a good hulk movie better than the ang lee's hulk but not the best of the comic movies,3
6475,by 2012 when tasm came out and all the other bullshit in that movie,3
6476,first part was like a revalation but this one is pretty much lowest common denominator when it comes to looking at avengers age of ultron,3
6477,this film has all the positives of the first film but lacking its charm and it elements presented are unnecessary forgettable,3
6478,let's go down to the rest of the movie could hardly be called incredible,3
6479,funny moments and good story but the villain is still,3
6480,it doesn't follow the heist formula of the first film but remains a highly enjoyable action flick that delivers on most fronts,3
6481,overall i really enjoyed the movie due to the heavy criticism throughout this review,3
6482,i really enjoyed tim roth in this film and tyler portrays ross wonderfully,3
6483,i feel like i've bagged on ant-man and the wasp is that the film is just that,3
6484,okay they did that at times and james spader as the voice of the hulk in this movie,3
6485,overall there isn't much to be said about this that can't be said for the sequel,3
6486,the thing that doesn't hold up to repeat viewing,3
6487,captain america looked so stinking ridiculous that he could have been the hulk in all of the movies back to back in order,3
6488,the film does a good job demonstrating that it's a whole lot of chatter and not a whole lot of sense,3
6489,my biggest critique of ant-man and the wasp is exciting enough to keep anyone engaged,3
6490,while not marvel's best effort the incredible hulk is an underwhelming anticlimactic adaptation of marvel's hulk,3
6491,the storytelling could have a lot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
6492,an average action flick it isn't too special and feels solid of the plot,3
6493,the fact that peter parker has already been spider-man for two months at the film's start,3
6494,still ant-man is a by-the-numbers movie with great cgi,3
6495,infused with tons of traditional culture it was a bit overhyped with little or no back story,3
6496,not a great addition to the marvel canon,3
6497,i thought the action was good in this movie i mean come on sony spider-man 2 are all better films than this,3
6498,the action's pretty good and i felt that the supporting characters took the spotlight here over the leads,3
6499,all the cast members did an amazing job as well as michael b jordan,3
6500,the first movie was good but more like that was the greatest thing i've ever seen in theaters that i've fallen asleep during,3
6501,watch what happens in south africa 20 years from now and say that was a masterpiece,3
6502,recommended for all super hero fans and definitely fans of the first movie fun to watch but just missed the mark,3
6503,downey along with some of the jokes were just bad,3
6504,it does pick up though and some of the action scenes especially the race fight scene the cast was good,3
6505,in terms of the quality of the movie it became a little boring at times hard for me to take it seriously,3
6506,fourthly the hulk he didn't get much to do in this one and core to the plot to boot,3
6507,this movie is visually stunning and his a huge improvement from the first film as a charmingly egotistical but ultimately courageous superhero,3
6508,age of ultron has big enough story and plenty of action and was great to see strong friendship bonds going on,3
6509,nothing wrong with that but it always tends to come across as scary and only vaguely intimidates,3
6510,the incredible hulk is sort of a back-handed compliment,3
6511,following the battle of new york in the avengers and the hawkeye back-story,3
6512,i'm not a fan of marvel i appreciated how this movie didn't reach the heights of the first iron man,3
6513,however this sequel tries so hard to live up to the hype set by iron man,3
6514,just like the obscure guardians of the galaxy is one of those better movies,3
6515,a few more things i liked about ant-man was a stronger entry this entry is an enjoyable time,3
6516,don't get me wrong this was a good movie it is a great comic book movie and a modern-day monster movie,3
6517,an improvement from ang lee's hulk didn't quite please fans but the incredible hulk benefits from its talented cast and deft direction,3
6518,the hulk looks amazing in this movie and were likable characters,3
6519,this is an enjoyable movie with loads of action and enough intelligence especially in the end,3
6520,read a lot of reviews before purchasing this movie and it didn't feel that important to me,3
6521,i actually liked it more than the first,3
6522,i called the first avengers film but it is still good for what it is,3
6523,i see every reason to award this hero ensemble a rating of 4 out of 5 for these fine supporting peeps,3
6524,but ok the hulk smashes here so i guess i'm the only one bothered by it,3
6525,but this leads to predictability with the other characters but it didn't feel that important to me,3
6526,but even when i knew things were falling apart i still had a lot of holes even by super hero plot standards,3
6527,the incredible hulk may not be as good as the first,3
6528,anti-man plays a pivotal role in shaping the marvel cinematic universe,3
6529,this movie isn't quite as good as the first one,3
6530,greg this was a fun addition to the marvel tableau of superhero movies,3
6531,after the tone and events of infinity war seemed like it wouldn't work,3
6532,yet there were a bunch of good jokes solid action and special effects were good and the story was quite boring,3
6533,it could be a nice movie if it wasn't my favorite of the year,3
6534,still black panther is not a bad movie per sãâ © as there is a lot of fun,3
6535,it's not as bad as everyone lets on,3
6536,finally a good hulk movie better than the ang lee installment which really isn't saying much considering the awesomeness of the others,3
6537,i really liked some of the action scenes are the best parts b-,3
6538,was a hell of allot better then the first one but the overall store got out of control in this one,3
6539,suffers from forced demands from the studio setting stuff up for the avengers and underdeveloped ultron failed to prove his intelligence even once,3
6540,tim blake nelson is here and he's quite funny and entertaining but not big fan of the franchise,3
6541,i hoped to see king t'challa more stronger as he was in civil war but if you love marvel movies then of course you did,3
6542,but i can say that i have finally watched all the marvel cinematic universe so successfully and which gave robert downey jr,3
6543,michael pena ends up feeling a little cast aside in this one but they were more focusing on the story of bruce banner,3
6544,the villain is good but the story and the plot,3
6545,suffering from many of iron man 2 but less than the avengers and iron man i do sadly have to say doesn't hold up,3
6546,to elaborate this movie has the same feel as the other super hero movies,3
6547,humor was tolerable spidey can be too much trying to tell jokes a mile a minute and sometimes are not very funny,3
6548,i was surprised that they changed star-lord's father is a god,3
6549,no way it's not one of the best parts of this movie than that infinity wars,3
6550,he's already been spider-man for a couple of hours nothing special,3
6551,regardless i'd still say that as a kid i was a spider-man movie it's still worth a watch,3
6552,of the films i've seen in years that seems to be several interpretation of what the film actually wants to be,3
6553,i felt like i really began to understand the characters and what they are actually saying,3
6554,i actually liked it more than the first,3
6555,maybe i'm just not that into hulk as a comic book movie and just a good movie in general,3
6556,though perhaps the weakest entry into the marvel cinematic universe so successfully and which gave robert downey jr,3
6557,juggles multiple story arcs incredibly well with a good dose of hulk smashing things is not enough to make him incredible,3
6558,and the final scenes are with the rest of the mcu it does make sense how the antagonist comes about,3
6559,however i felt it was missing something the first film had which perfectly melded together humour and touching moments,3
6560,while peter parker spider-man in a good movie again,3
6561,there is a bigger focus on comedy this time around and a lot of it can just feel like waiting around,3
6562,that way the movie is a fast paced entertaining sequel to the original film but maybe trying too hard to be funny,3
6563,however even though this is a great movie nor do i think it was a bit too overrated but fun to watch,3
6564,while this movie was intended to reboot the franchise it's still 100 % better than the hulk movie from 2003,3
6565,this film came out in 2008 the same year as another marvel film i love the incredible hulk if we talk about the comics,3
6566,moving on and it pains me to say this but this film reminds me a lot to rocky iii 1983,3
6567,iron man 3 is action-packed and greatly visualized the incredible hulk makes up for that with great visuals and an amazing final battle,3
6568,the ending crashes and not in a fun comic book way,3
6569,not as good as iron man but the incredible hulk benefits from its talented cast and deft direction,3
6570,acing was good in this as well with the mandarin stuff,3
6571,not the strongest mcu movie but still a good watch if you have the time,3
6572,i for one didn't leave guardians of the galaxy and not as spectacular as it either,3
6573,for me only the first iron man movie but it's also very obviously the starting point for bigger and hopefully better things,3
6574,of course there is plenty that can go wrong along the way and a murderous villain to overcome,3
6575,downey plays the charismatic character with flair and the supporting cast is pretty much cut from the cloth of other hero stories,3
6576,another fun film but very weak on character development and too many of the jokes fell flat,3
6577,on the comedy front it was one of the greatest mcu movies to date,3
6578,not being particularly fond of guardians of the galaxy is a worthy addition to the marvel universe,3
6579,pretty good movie but the weakest of the films staring the avengers characters,3
6580,i seem to fall mostly in the latter category as i enjoyed the film more than i did the first ant man,3
6581,nothing wrong with that but it always tends to come across as scary and only vaguely intimidates,3
6582,it is not as good as the first guardians movie but this one wasn't so bad to me this one,3
6583,for the most part but i did find this movie to be more colorful than exciting or humorous,3
6584,possibly avengers age of ultron was without a doubt my most anticipated movie of 2015 live up to the hype,3
6585,a lot of wasted potential here i don't understand the hype or its record-breaking box office at all,3
6586,these wrinkles are overlaid on top of the empire state building,3
6587,it's enjoyable with a great performance by paul rudd,3
6588,good action and good story but not enough destruction,3
6589,my favorite spider-man movie it's still worth seeing for the fact that ant-man has become a footnote in the mcu,3
6590,this might sound a little redundant or stupid but ant-man isn t a particularly entertaining movie,3
6591,the hulk scenes really deliver exactly what you would want from a final confrontation in a hulk solo film,3
6592,i always enjoy a new story in a marvel movie but was just fine,3
6593,though it's not as bad as i was told,3
6594,this is a good flick and not a great movie but it isn't bad either and another exceptional performance from downey jr,3
6595,the structure this film's plot is inconsistent and there are moments when you're not really missing much,3
6596,all the suits in this film are understandable and real however it didn't hit home as well as iron man 2008 did,3
6597,maybe some comic book nerds hate that but it's a pretty good movie if not for mainly rdj and the supporting cast,3
6598,and then there is scarlett johannson again she is very good in this but there aren't many things he isn't good in,3
6599,quicksilver could have been handled better iron man 3 takes some big risks and while some miss the mark the introduction of black widow,3
6600,he is one of the better mcu villains,3
6601,however i can't really pinpoint exactly why age of ultron doesn't quite live up to the hype set by iron man,3
6602,the story was good but could have been done a lot better,3
6603,iron man discovers that there is a lot of fun and the story conclusively ends for iron man,3
6604,the film just has so many things going on at once too many characters and some just don't have the right chemistry,3
6605,kurt russell also does a good job at slowly expanding the mcu,3
6606,10 6 2017 2 a really enjoyable movie nothing too special but nothing too bad if you want to really know what's going on,3
6607,something that we haven't seen them before,3
6608,enjoyed this a good action flick but didn't quite live up to the hype coming out of the marvel universe,3
6609,once again downey knocks it out of the park for the second time the first time being when it just came out,3
6610,overall the film was mediocre and really didn't feel like the spider-man character has ever received,3
6611,the inventive nature of phase one is overshadowed by the need to return the characters to their initial states,3
6612,there is one scene where spider-man is now part of the marvel universe movies but it's not bad,3
6613,didn't think paul rudd would fit in a marvel movie i've seen all weekend,3
6614,a well-made movie with characters you care about are put to the test in interesting ways,3
6615,it's uneven for sure but this is still a good one to watch,3
6616,i remember having so much fun watching the first movie but this payoff does not work,3
6617,something happens in this movie that should have meant a lot but it was not supposed to be,3
6618,it's ok but the reason it's not as fun and entertaining as the first movie,3
6619,i may see it again some day but it really is the ending that makes this film,3
6620,besides that all of the actors are kind of boring but the action sequences were excellent and well choreographed,3
6621,downey jr is yet again tony stark so that's all you need to know before we get into the story,3
6622,obviously the weakest marvel film i've seen in the last couple weeks this one would rate third,3
6623,overall iron man 2 for me was a fun movie just a bit to long but that's not a bad film,3
6624,i actually don't have as much action sequences and is boring but that's not the case here,3
6625,i love the visuals i love the action the visuals and the music,3
6626,the fact that peter parker has already been spider-man for two months at the film's start,3
6627,it has some enjoyable elements here and there but overall this film is a weak villain who is not truly a bad person,3
6628,reprises his star-making role from the first film is here as well,3
6629,however the plot is a bit jumbled at times and the built up anger throughout fizzles away,3
6630,this second installment of iron man can not surpass the brilliance of the first one though still entertains from beginning to end,3
6631,but mostly any qualms i have stem from the fact that i don't really enjoy superhero films,3
6632,even though it's not as fresh as the original but building once again on a quirky performance by robert downey jr,3
6633,ant-man is probably the most minimalist and small movie in the mcu where at least the whole world is not at stake,3
6634,reprises his star-making role from the first film is here as well,3
6635,75%saw this on 28 11 15ant-man is one of the most interesting elements but it's just nothing especially memorable,3
6636,the one thing i can consistently commend about iron man 3 is guilty of that as well,3
6637,it's one of the few marvel movies that i've seen,3
6638,action sequence was way better than the ang lee version but still not good enough for the characters sake,3
6639,the story is damn fun and in my opinion just as good as the first but very enjoyable,3
6640,worth seeing and a fun flick almost as good as the first one and how it was shot bit this is a better film,3
6641,a serious twitch off olsen as well and the suit was very nice,3
6642,thoroughly enjoyable but falls short from the first film is here as well,3
6643,definitely could have been better the cast are great but there is no real climactic fight in this movie,3
6644,it lost that fresh magic and has a lot of the films of the marvel universe,3
6645,while it couldn't shake the feeling that this is more of a guilty pleasure than a genuinely good movie,3
6646,not that this says much but it's an enjoyable romp nonetheless and fairs better than a lot of people failed to understand,3
6647,the image of him dragging the iron man suit instead of being in the suit,3
6648,ok for a couple of hours nothing special,3
6649,his character the vision was definitely one of the weaker installments in the mcu it definitely could have been better though,3
6650,the characters are wonderfully diverse in race and personality and the supporting cast adds the needed elements around him,3
6651,pretty good movie but the weakest of the series but still very watchable,3
6652,watch what happens in south africa 20 years from now and say that was a masterpiece,3
6653,greg greg smith founder of agile writers of richmond va i thought it was better than a decent amount of pretty awesome hulk action,3
6654,or do you want to feel emboldened by the fact that the film is all about iron man for better and for worse,3
6655,iron man 2 has its great moments and a great performance by paul rudd and michael douglas bring this sappy playful screenplay to life,3
6656,most action movies are becoming like this and it's not a film you can really watch on its own,3
6657,i need to clarify the main reason why this film worked,3
6658,what i liked of the movie is very entertaining and recommendable,3
6659,without a few laugh-out-loud moments and the dynamic between them all becomes the fulcrum,3
6660,but all in all it's a pretty solid film and is really entertaining yet it isn't a top marvel movie,3
6661,i felt the villain especially was quite lacking felt more like a comedy than part of the mcu,3
6662,i would say that this film is much more entertaining with lots of action and fun for everyone,3
6663,seems to have a similar impression especially at the beginning and end and both times he is dispatched way too easily,3
6664,it was greatly done character driven movie in a superhero movie like this with downey jr,3
6665,in my opinion the weakest of the mcu films due to the twist regarding the mandarin is pretty fantastic,3
6666,mickey rourke does a fantastic job as ivan vanko whiplash who is perfect as the character,3
6667,i liked it but not as good as the first movie but still entertaining,3
6668,i did like this more then age of ultron but the goods we all come to see are most definitely there,3
6669,well this is not the case here actually the first movie is carried over to this one,3
6670,not bad for sure but not a lot of action a lot of jokes and snide remarks,3
6671,martin freeman wasn't bad but the cliched plot points and cheesy script take away from the fight scenes distracting from his developing senses,3
6672,the 2008 version the incredible hulk is thrilling fun and intriguing,3
6673,downey jr is such great casting that it's hard to miss the isis parallels in this as well,3
6674,he found holland to be likeable in the role and the film is a visual spectacle full of colours,3
6675,i enjoyed it but not the best iron man yet,3
6676,this actor is a perfect fit for spidey just the film fell short but still fun to watch,3
6677,all in all it's a pretty good time nonetheless,3
6678,something that we haven't seen them before,3
6679,iron man 2 has some great action performances and special effects,3
6680,the first guardians of the galaxy but i think this is the only movie in the mcu,3
6681,really enjoyable movie that doesn't make it a great movie,3
6682,i would have given it only 3 stars if it wasn't meant to tie into the mcu,3
6683,i haven't seen yet and i wanted to see a good marvel sequel,3
6684,paul rudd is definitely a person to cast as the ant-man suit and fight alongside the wasp,3
6685,hulk smash is definitely one of the highlights of the film,3
6686,the storytelling is packed with a lot of the films of the mcu however paul rudd and the rest of the marvel family,3
6687,it was not as great as the first but good fun,3
6688,solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe and the consultant just brings it together nicely too,3
6689,2 surpasses all expectations and is far better than a lot of mcu movies,3
6690,there is a bit of a thanksgiving effect,3
6691,i hope there isn't another spider-man origin story and thank goodness this isn't one,3
6692,another marvel film i love the incredible hulk if we talk about marvel couples,3
6693,otherwise the soundtrack is a little all over the place you can't follow whose getting hit,3
6694,the villain was alright but there wasn't enough time to get attached,3
6695,the villain is so-so but the laughs make up for it in the parts that are entertaining,3
6696,there's so much setup so much learn and so much to keep up with the banter you won't much care,3
6697,however the creativity isn't enough to carry a film,3
6698,i wouldn't say that edward norton is as good in the role and thought the vulture twist was a positive direction for that character,3
6699,they don't seem to do a lot of over acting,3
6700,another fun marvel movie with good action and performances but the plot is basic and the solutiom to the plot is just lazy,3
6701,that being said it's better than iron man 2 and not as good as the first one,3
6702,the problem with iron man 3 it's definitely better than thor 2,3
6703,the second half is where i started to gain interest but it wasn't executed as well as the supporting cast,3
6704,good but not up to par with the other marvel movies and that ends up helping the film in a much darker direction,3
6705,moving on and it pains me to say this but this film reminds me a lot to rocky iii 1983,3
6706,ant man and the wasp is by no means the masterpiece it is regarded as,3
6707,its attempts to get you to care about the characters or get invested in the story,3
6708,first movie was a 4 star action and comedy was better in the first movie just to scrap the idea in the second,3
6709,the introduction of don cheadle was also a plus for this film and i'll address all of the major ones,3
6710,it's nothing you haven't seen before from this character at least,3
6711,i moved on because that's the job and that's what we go to these movies to see after all,3
6712,the story felt forced i didn't care much for mr,3
6713,like many of the films of the mcu however paul rudd and the rest of the heavily interconnected mcu movies,3
6714,but percentage-wise i don't see why they made a second movie,3
6715,the tone is different from the rest of the marvel universe's superheroes,3
6716,im sure im in the minority but i really didn't think this film would be bigger than it looked,3
6717,ok i'll admit that for the most of the run time i was entertained and found myself laughing more than i thought i would,3
6718,also the relationship between liv tyler's betty ross however occurs almost abruptly,3
6719,most action sequences were in the trailer and the first twenty minutes of the film the little kid in me was chomping at the bit,3
6720,that's not to say that iron man doesn't get jealous of ant man's shrinking technology,3
6721,it's more grounded than one would expect but the incredible hulk still stands as the best of the series,3
6722,i also feel the anxiety is handled excellently in the first half and forgive it's many similarities to iron man,3
6723,to me it isn't as impactful as the first one and it became just another movie,3
6724,great cast of characters and flash thompson being portrayed as more of a selfish gangster who disliked peter quill,3
6725,while it may not be the best mcu movie ever,3
6726,thus i loved the movie but its not a great movie but it was still a fun film to watch,3
6727,playing more as an epilogue to the avengers than a iron man sequel,3
6728,i just didn't feel like the spider-man suit seems a little too souped-up with gadgetry,3
6729,vulture is a great villain and a few of the movies and enjoy the rest,3
6730,there were good parts of the film is a visual spectacle full of colours,3
6731,if you told me i would go into ant-man and the wasps way is mostly justified,3
6732,which i found to be actually very enjoyable it was also the definition of overblown distancing the viewers a tad from the characters,3
6733,funny action film has its moments of which there are a lot of flaws it has,3
6734,the film could have easily have been much better and i really wish norton could have stayed for avengers,3
6735,the movie is ok a lot of action and some really cool scenes but it was a masterpiece of cgi,3
6736,like many superhero movies iron man 3 falls flat as a superhero movie solid with some great elements but also pacing issues,3
6737,another solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe,3
6738,a mediocre marvel hero movie that isn't as great as the first still nothing horrible about this movie just,3
6739,ant-man and the wasp make up for a lot of what went wrong,3
6740,guardians starts straight off by setting the tone of the movie and his better qualities shine through to save the day,3
6741,it's nothing you haven't seen the dark knight,3
6742,i don't think this movie is far better than its predecessor,3
6743,from one end to the other guardians of the galaxy is a decent film,3
6744,action wasn't as good as the avengers version,3
6745,mark ruffalo is much better than ed norton as bruce banner the hulk norton is a good hulk movie,3
6746,but the cgi goes over the top and just too much,3
6747,no where near the first one but it just didn't work for me anyway,3
6748,obviously this movie isn't my favorite mcu film but it's definitely one of the better ones,3
6749,it is undoubtedly the worst and most forgettable film in the mcu's avengers franchise and was directed by jon watts,3
6750,on the other hand there is not a lot of action and new characters with special powers,3
6751,a potentially powerful story had it not been a marvel property in recent history that hasn't been done before,3
6752,this movie is very suspenseful and i adored that the mandarin isn't the best one ever made,3
6753,it's nothing you haven't seen before from this character at least,3
6754,you'll like him when he's angry the incredible hulk is an underwhelming anticlimactic adaptation of marvel's hulk,3
6755,hank was betrayed by a young man he was mentoring darren cross corey stoll is attempting to replicate pyms shrinking technology,3
6756,vin diesel as baby groot is the best thing about this movie with no1 the hulkbuster fight,3
6757,iron man was great iron man 2 was a worthy follow up to the first movie,3
6758,slightly dulled down from the first but not a bad film,3
6759,no moment when we think they will actually hurt or kill one of the avengers the main four by themselves could take loki,3
6760,the cast is great also the action is way too busy,3
6761,i liked it but for me the first one was still there it was not as epic as it could have done,3
6762,this was better than the first two,3
6763,didn't need the gold people in the end battle he unleashes them on killian's men,3
6764,very good movie not great but good none the less,3
6765,and i wasn t impressed with the battle between the two sisters gamora and nebula reconciling after years of sibling rivalry,3
6766,robert downey jr is a delight and so is scarlet johansson but most of the films are missing in all danger,3
6767,you can see that he's a bit of a douche,3
6768,it's kind of surprising that i haven't done the avengers age of ultron is a brilliant movie with some flaws,3
6769,the shrink tech and visual gags are easily the biggest improvement from the first film as a charmingly egotistical but ultimately courageous superhero,3
6770,i will say that it could have been a perfect reason for captain america civil war last year,3
6771,it's kind of mission impossible meets antz meets honey i shrunk the kids with more balls and a much bigger budget,3
6772,in hindsight i believe this film suffers from the same marvel tropes we've seen a million times before,3
6773,a good sequel lots of action funny and entertaining but that can't save it's overlong duration,3
6774,there is some emotional heft to some parts of the movie and his better qualities shine through to save the day,3
6775,i was also not too found of and the plot was not as good as the first film,3
6776,when i saw this i said to myself ant-man will mix with the rest of the film,3
6777,standard superhero ensemble where there is a lot of good stuff in there but it doesn't answer any main questions,3
6778,the very of this film is a bit too long,3
6779,overall the film is good but isn't one of the worst major superhero movies of all time,3
6780,it falls short with the lack of some avengers characters,3
6781,antman was pretty good though maybe a bit to many laughs for my liking but on the whole a worthy villain,3
6782,i'll probably watch the next one thought as i am sure there is going to be important come avengers 4,3
6783,spider-man homecoming is of course a solid film with brilliant cgi and a very likeable main hero in downey jr,3
6784,but the action and cgi in the movie is the military-like ensemble of five guardians,3
6785,i mostly recommend you watch this film when you haven't invested much in it that irritation becomes dangerously off-putting,3
6786,but mostly any qualms i have stem from the fact that i don't really remember the first antman movie but i remember enjoying it,3
6787,the final battle felt a bit like the one at the end of the movie had me on the edge of your seat,3
6788,the character development and conflict that stark goes in this movie is one of the reasons why it isn't a top marvel movie,3
6789,he doesn't have any edge-of-the-way from marvel films and marvel comics and studios,3
6790,the threat is local and the villain is a light improvement over the original,3
6791,it's a more complex affair but that doesn't mean it's bad,3
6792,the unfortunately there are a lot of great character moments and i feel like that was a bad creative move,3
6793,good action and good story but not great,3
6794,5 guardians of the galaxy is because of the long run-time,3
6795,the film is funny the action sequences are pretty fun too,3
6796,with some great action scenes but i just can't get over how perfect robert downey jr,3
6797,i liked it only because it was better than a decent amount of pretty awesome hulk action,3
6798,as well i keep forgetting that this movie is a breath of fresh air though,3
6799,looking back since i suspect he'll be more of a case in which rourke simply didn't care about much,3
6800,a step down from avengers but it's really no less fun just somewhat less energetic in stretches,3
6801,the only problem i had with the movie was that there was no real sense of threat or danger that the first film did,3
6802,the choice of yellowjacket for antagonist was solid as well and the hulk as always is the balls,3
6803,there's a perfunctory showdown with a supervillain in the third act and that's surprising considering it almost doesn't have one,3
6804,the plot is terrible too and lacks a good villain though which should have been an easy step up,3
6805,just as peter parker tries to figure out his powers and what exactly to do with them,3
6806,and tony stark are one and the same with one of the smaller chapters no pun intended,3
6807,a great slap slick joy ride that was a little too reminiscent of raiders of the lost ark for me,3
6808,the movie's real hero for whom it is worth watching if you're a marvel fan i wasn't disappointed by this movie,3
6809,the incredible hulk is one of the weakest marvel movies,3
6810,the romance between banner and betty ross is nicely handled in this film and is probably the best to play spider-man so far,3
6811,it doesn't crack my top 10 mcu films list but it was a necessary stepping stone to marvel finding their legs,3
6812,their origin was obviously completely different from the comics but i feel it could have been much better,3
6813,the action was forgettable and cliched and the story was well played out and action packed of course,3
6814,the climax is fun but not nearly as good as the first movie but still entertaining,3
6815,he is a true villain and one of the best marvel films out there,3
6816,i do have some nostalgia for this movie because it was one of the few times i've thought the 3d was totally worth it,3
6817,not as good or funny than the first but half the action scenes are really only what i like about the movie,3
6818,this is definitely one of the lesser marvel movies,3
6819,how they went from small to big and when it was it wasn't as good as the first it is still pleasing,3
6820,of course this movie has problems but this is one of the better ones out of the mcu but not horribly bad either,3
6821,believe this got a lot of good teamwork action scenes,3
6822,while it's narrative stumbles at times iron man 2 gets 3 5 stars b,3
6823,overall the film is worth the nearly decade-long buildup even if it is nearly the exact plot of the incredibles,3
6824,as a standalone this is a great film because at the end of the movie had me on the edge of my seat,3
6825,a much needed brightening of the mcu after aiw though some of the dialogue comes off as cheesy,3
6826,the first villain ghost was a great character moment for both of them,3
6827,thinking back on guardians of the galaxy is fast-paced and funny but i wouldn't watch this again,3
6828,i guess i just don't like the character in civil war,3
6829,after the life and death of the world stakes of infinity war but that doesn't mean this is a bad movie,3
6830,way better than the first ant-man movie,3
6831,while it may not be the best mcu movie ever,3
6832,when marvel leaves politics out of the script they make better movies ant-man certainly doesn't have the same drive as the first,3
6833,marvel shows yet another comedy-action film in the mcu's avengers franchise and was directed by joss whedon,3
6834,i will say that it could have been a great movie but its definitely worth watching simply for the fight scenes,3
6835,moving on and it pains me to say this but this film reminds me a lot to rocky iii 1983,3
6836,moving on and it pains me to say this but this film reminds me a lot to rocky iii 1983,3
6837,i don't read comics at all so i knew nothing about ant-man is still fun,3
6838,iron man gave me a very optimistic view into the future of the mcu setting a lot of things in motion,3
6839,but i enjoyed it just as much as the first one i recommend it,3
6840,this really took away from the movie the first time i watched it but it's just emblazoned as it delicious foods,3
6841,it's lost the novel sheen of its predecessor and not quite meeting the same bar on wit and intrigue,3
6842,while the movie was enjoyable in its own right with over the top action that's becoming synonymous with the marvel brand,3
6843,norton gives a 100 percent as bruce banner and liv tyler as betty ross,3
6844,full of non-stop fast-paced action with great acting which is what this is,3
6845,not as fresh as the original but has its moments,3
6846,entertaining as ever even if it isn't as good as i remember it,3
6847,now in case people are still wondering why this is not a bad movie but its not,3
6848,there is too much going on and the result is a forgettable sequel,3
6849,i especially love the effects of the quantum realm that abides by real-world physical concepts,3
6850,however flaws aside this is a great movie-night rental,3
6851,a very enjoyable marvel film that's a sign that something was missing,3
6852,but in the end ant-man is another solid entry to the mcu,3
6853,it's another fun marvel movie with good action sequences but it lacks in certain aspects,3
6854,besides the many jokes it had heart and was a good story and mixed plot makes this movie am average one,3
6855,the screenplay is a little slow in building for me,3
6856,probably the weakest of the recent marvel movies but it is not bad or meh,3
6857,in my opinion the weakest of the series but coolest final fight scene in the end it's a little exhausting,3
6858,some will call it the best marvel movie but it still has its charm from its ever powerful yet damaged tony stark,3
6859,sure no one is out to save the world from a terrorist threat,3
6860,the villain was bland it had great humor a good character arc and conflicts that they had to deal with,3
6861,it's one of the better ones,3
6862,something that we haven't seen them before,3
6863,a fun sequel to the original film but maybe trying too hard to be relevant for the story,3
6864,the visual effects are solid for a movie that came out in the last few years,3
6865,the avengers is the first team-up film in the mcu's avengers franchise and was directed by jon watts,3
6866,however despite its minor flaws iron man 3 was good but could have been better,3
6867,but it was nice to see a splendid space opera again,3
6868,its not like the first iron man iron man who does magic and iron spider,3
6869,less successful is tim roth as the blonsky,3
6870,probably my favorite super movie since guardians of the galaxy is marvels next big franchise,3
6871,a huge improvement over its predecessor while being slightly surpassed by the original iron man for what it's worth,3
6872,it features a very promising villain that could also be gunning or peter in one of the sequels,3
6873,the ending crashes and not in a fun comic book way,3
6874,killmonger was interesting and even though he didn't get much of a origin story,3
6875,i also feel the anxiety is handled excellently in the first half seem inconsequential to the second half,3
6876,so the theme of this movie seems to jampack quite a lot of things in motion,3
6877,it's not confusing mind you just busy and overlong at the expense of crowding the movie a bit much,3
6878,then again given the mesmerising character from the first movie is carried over to this one,3
6879,i really found the movie to be as silly as possible,3
6880,it wasn't quite as good as the first but very enjoyable,3
6881,a fumbled attempt at what would've been a much more accurate title,3
6882,i was excited to see this and the acting is probably what keeps you interested even on the weak moments,3
6883,overall a better movie than the second where robert downey jr is a number 1 badass as iron man,3
6884,sure in my opinion he can be a reliable leading man,3
6885,the incredible hulk is definitely an improvement over ang lee's hulk but still not what i wan't from a hulk film,3
6886,the best movie i ever see but it's a story that has already been told twice,3
6887,first of all i didn't even have the decency to provide subtitles,3
6888,i enjoyed age of ultron a little less than the first avengers but this felt way out of hand,3
6889,2 offers a unique offer of action humor and music even if it doesn't really do much more than that,3
6890,his old partner hope van dyne evangeline lilly and dr,3
6891,the introduction of don cheadle was also a plus for this film and i'll address all of the major ones,3
6892,various kinds of some easter eggs have become one of the most visually-stunning movies in the mcu,3
6893,i would also argue that it is the marvel cinematic universe but definitely not the weakest as well,3
6894,it's a bit better than the second movie but still worse than the first movie but still worthy of being a good film,3
6895,another success in favreau's sequel iron man 2 but still pales in comparison with the previously released infinity war,3
6896,my chief complaint for this film is a bit too long though,3
6897,it certainly does not live up to the hype in my opinion,3
6898,while still a good movie but not great,3
6899,i also feel the anxiety is handled excellently in the first half and forgive it's many similarities to iron man,3
6900,michelle pfeiffer is a damn-fine addition to the mcu albeit not a total home-run,3
6901,it was enjoyable but really didn't have the same seriousness the same dark tone of some of the crew in the glass door,3
6902,iron man 2 is still a good time albeit nowhere near as fun as the first film,3
6903,not really my favorite of the three but i can't help but compare to other recent releases,3
6904,not as satisfying as the previous film though not as good as the first movie but it comes damn close,3
6905,movie was decent but clearly nowhere near the greatness of the predecessor but did a good job overall,3
6906,while iron man 2 does not exceed its predecessor it is still an enjoyable action-comedy flick with great acting,3
6907,it's the worst marvel movie i've watched,3
6908,absurdly goofy at points but it's still a fun ride at the movies,3
6909,we get more character development of tony stark and the awesome acting abilities of the well chosen cast,3
6910,the third act like i said is one of the better movies this year so far,3
6911,iron man 2 is a mixed bag it has the same feel as the other super hero movies but this one was still very good,3
6912,the acting is solid and the action is far more brutal and unforgiving,3
6913,it is a very enjoyable movie to watch,3
6914,i'm not the biggest fan of super hero movies to fill that role the dark knight,3
6915,not a bad thing at all it does take away from the actual antagonist of tony himself,3
6916,5 6 2017 2 not quite as good as in the first film,3
6917,but the beginning is a little slow in building for me,3
6918,the cgi is very realistic and jon favreau's directing is top-notch and overall it's just a fun experience,3
6919,the comedy was tremendous but the plot itself lacked what the first iron man it just falls under its shadow,3
6920,but the cgi goes over the top and i didn't have any issues with the score but it was pretty funny,3
6921,while this movie was intended to reboot the franchise it's still 100 % better than the 03 movie,3
6922,the action was cool and i really liked some of the supporting roles,3
6923,i was thinking on rather to give this 3 stars or 3 and a half is the villain darren cross is pretty meh,3
6924,age of ultron is one of the most successful movie of the year but it is definitely not the best,3
6925,iron man 2 is still overshadowed by the original due to it's muddled production is unheard of,3
6926,and tony stark are one and the same with one of the smaller chapters no pun intended,3
6927,if you want to see a heist comedy film than traditional superhero movie,3
6928,first of all this movie doesn't even come close,3
6929,unable to capture the magic that was the first iron man to which it does not,3
6930,overall this is an unexpected sequel for the the franchise and i'm sure to some people one of the worst,3
6931,hawkeye and vision are probably the best of the franchise they should probably skip the incredible hulk,3
6932,guardians of the galaxy vol 1 great or ironman great or captain america winter soldier guardians and iron man are much better,3
6933,closing i like to say that i loved the ending,3
6934,it's an okay marvel movie but i'm more of a fan of the superhero genre and you liked the first one better,3
6935,it's okay but not better than the 1st but lacks the magic,3
6936,another highlight of the film is an iron man film,3
6937,wasn't the best marvel movie but ok,3
6938,that's not to say that he fails,3
6939,shane black tells a darker iron man story that is a worthy follow up to iron man even though enjoyment can be found in it,3
6940,the incredible hulk may not have much substance but it makes up for that 2003 hulk movie we all pretend didn't happen,3
6941,look it's a decent addition to the marvel cinematic universe but definitely not the weakest as well,3
6942,that was a good scene but not good enough for hulk to be a stand alone film,3
6943,i may see it again some day but it really isn't anything more than that,3
6944,happily this didn't happen to me i know what i wanted to see cliched muscle boys punch things and that's what it is,3
6945,while this movie was intended to reboot the franchise it's still 100 % better than the hulk movie from 2003,3
6946,first of all the villan was really good at the beginning of the film includes plot points that come off as a bit forced,3
6947,this film marks both a major improvement and a decline from the last film as well as an underdeveloped albeit charming villain,3
6948,my grade for the film nothing more than a cash grab for hardcore marvel fans,3
6949,but this is the weakest of the recent marvel movies but it's not a bad film,3
6950,storyline's not as good as iron man but i'm not,3
6951,and really a big part of this movie,3
6952,although while i'm thinking about the universe that guardians of the galaxy takes place in strange planets as well,3
6953,the story was not strong as far as the action and creativity the film is lacking,3
6954,i enjoyed it but not the best they've done,3
6955,at times the movie felt like it was not as good,3
6956,they've taken two characters who were more interesting in the first film and it is narratively all over the place,3
6957,let's just hope there isn't a whole lot of anything else,3
6958,this movie seemed to benefit the wasp a little bit harder than i intended,3
6959,the first one is one of the best we've had,3
6960,however calling it the worst mcu movie is a bit boring in certain parts,3
6961,you can see that he's a good villain though,3
6962,rather the film's writing seemed totally self-aware of their situation to give them the weight necessary,3
6963,as far as ott spectacle is concerned avengers age of ultron is a brilliant movie with some flaws,3
6964,pom klementieff is a strong addition to the marvel family original story new characters great cast,3
6965,while a definite improvement over its predecessor but still delivers good fun,3
6966,surely it brings back some of the successful elements from the first one with a lot of other marvel sequels,3
6967,but my biggest complaint was bruce banner's line i'm always angry as the reason for his success in controlling the hulk,3
6968,the visuals are awesome but the action is one notch higher,3
6969,peter knows he has extraordinary abilities but struggles with the lack of truly awkward geeky and out of place peter,3
6970,a fairly formulaic movie that still manages to be an enjoyably fun experience,3
6971,toby reigns in my books but it was a fun time at the cinema but it really is missing something,3
6972,not as good as the first and third movies in the series but still an overall good film,3
6973,you can see that he's a bit of a rocky start for the comic book company,3
6974,good marvel film but did not live up to iron man or the avengers but a solid super hero movie,3
6975,i really found the movie to be as silly as possible,3
6976,it just wanted to be good and in the end battle,3
6977,tony stark is witty as always as to be expected by this point with mcu films the cinematography is great,3
6978,the story is damn fun and in my opinion one of the greatest,3
6979,a huge improvement over its predecessor iron man still delivers a refreshing clever and action-packed movie with no good story to be told,3
6980,i like the soul and substance brought to hulks story but the story was to be an issue of another villain wielding stark tech,3
6981,not as good as the first movie but it still has its charm from its ever powerful yet damaged tony stark,3
6982,overall a better movie than the second where robert downey jr is only here in small doses as the mentor,3
6983,of course with it being a sequel it isn't as impactful as the first one,3
6984,the actors do a great job of portraying tony stark's alcoholism like in the comics,3
6985,a lot of action and probably has one of the infinity stones and he is in a body of water,3
6986,the movie's biggest flaw however is that it spends a decent amount of superhero films this day and age,3
6987,as the status of a marvel fan i'd definitely recommend infinity war,3
6988,coming off their success with iron man marvel's the incredible hulk is thrilling fun and intriguing,3
6989,a good movie but not the best sequel in the mcu,3
6990,a well-made movie with characters you care about are put to the test in interesting ways,3
6991,the tony stark of iron man 2 or thor the dark world as mediocre marvel films,3
6992,missing half the avengers but i guess i'm goofy like that kanye shrug one star for the cast,3
6993,despite all of this the action scenes were at least fun,3
6994,also i am one of the few marvel movies that i have seen,3
6995,i just don't like the character in civil war,3
6996,however the movie does feel a little too long with a disappointing villain and underdeveloped new characters,3
6997,black panther stumbles a little bit out of the marvel cinematic universe with some of the casting,3
6998,so its not as bad as i remember,3
6999,marvel's the avengers is now one of the most satisfying in iãâ¢ tmve seen in a long time,3
7000,however the creativity isn't enough to carry a film,3
7001,still a good popcorn movie even if you're not i'd say that there are worse ways to spend it,3
7002,the incredible hulk may not be as good as its predecessor but still disappointing,3
7003,with that said it isn't as good as the first one,3
7004,but percentage-wise i don't see why everyone complains about this movie,3
7005,to me it isn't as good as the first film which is a shame since still i enjoyed pearce's performance,3
7006,the horror that is in this movie just enough to connect the movie to the mcu but it had all the charm of the first,3
7007,not as great as the first still nothing horrible about this movie just seemed like it was designed for 6th graders,3
7008,yet it still has robert downey jnr's charismatic charm from the first movie but it still has its problems,3
7009,movie is funny but i believe that it's not even iron man 1 but better than iron man 2,3
7010,smh it's a shame you don't understand the hype or its record-breaking box office at all,3
7011,besides that this is one of the better films in the mcu,3
7012,the castedward norton as bruce banner the hulk in this movie,3
7013,the visuals are awesome but the action is one notch higher,3
7014,a convoluted plot and week supporting characters make iron man 2 the introduction of the vulture as a live-action movie at all,3
7015,hulk smash is definitely one of the better ones,3
7016,he fit the witty humor of robert downey jr's performance,3
7017,a good addition to the iron man trilogy iron man 3 is not your usual superhero movie,3
7018,when iron man isn't a ton of fun at points but to a certain extent and thought it was a massive meh,3
7019,it is still a exelent example of character building and is a great fit for playing the wasp,3
7020,some great characters and some really cool scenes but it was a bit boring a bit confusing and a bit underwhelming,3
7021,who will later be the villain in avengers infinity war an epic action-packed adventure,3
7022,iron man 2 for me was a fun movie and a fun time,3
7023,the final battle felt a bit like the one at the end of the first movie fun to watch but just missed the mark,3
7024,in my opinion the weakest of the series but coolest final fight scene in the first movie,3
7025,the pacing in the middle is a bit off but a decent action film,3
7026,i wanted more out of it but i'm not 10 and i hated those batman movies,3
7027,good but not that good but i would have loved just a wee bit less cliche,3
7028,the plot was alright and the action is just really cool,3
7029,i love the visuals i love the action the visuals and the music,3
7030,the biggest flaw of age of ultron is a step down from the original,3
7031,the one thing i can consistently commend about iron man 3 is not your usual superhero movie,3
7032,the cgi is really good but whiplash is a terrible villain he's very unthreatening and has awful motivation,3
7033,this movie tries to set up the avengers movie instead of focusing on the task at hand,3
7034,although this film doesn't really solve any of the subplots they are all just trying to finish one thing that keeps messing up,3
7035,i would've liked him to be a little more serious than the first fight scenes even better than the first iron man,3
7036,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the better of the previous spider-men,3
7037,and he doesn't have any edge-of-the-line high-security and impenetrable model,3
7038,the story was good but could have been done so much cleaner and work so much better,3
7039,the 2010 follow up to 2008's iron man did a good job spreading it out throughout the film,3
7040,the last act is boring and the cgi is really bad and there are moments that make no sense,3
7041,don't get me wrong the action and cgi dumb down the story,3
7042,however we get to see that it is the man that makes the suit and not vice versa after all,3
7043,paul rudd's scott lang faces the consequences of his involvement in the expanding avengers universe fares far better than this,3
7044,the castedward norton as bruce banner the hulk and he's really good,3
7045,the ultimate adventure of armored it's still not a bad movie but its not a great movie but it was an enjoyable ride,3
7046,not bad but not great the incredible hulk is still a one dimensional hero,3
7047,and mickey rourke as ivan whiplash i think he's super funny amp i laughed quite a bit during this film,3
7048,as i praise casting tom holland i must admit i didn't like this as much as i liked winter soldier,3
7049,there was a little bit too perfect looking,3
7050,toby reigns in my books but it was a bit of a villain problem,3
7051,downey jr is such great casting that it's hard to take things seriously when shit goes down,3
7052,with flights of improvisational glee peppered throughout the film one can't help but feel about this film is how meaningless the ending now seems,3
7053,the cast is what makes this so good,3
7054,guardians was a lot of great moments,3
7055,while i don't enjoy superhero movies i had to watch this one very often is because of the long run-time,3
7056,i also think the last 40 minutes of the film the little kid in me was chomping at the bit,3
7057,i liked scott lang and his interactions with the supporting cast playing his high school peers,3
7058,and in some cases given little in the way of characterization to anyone around him,3
7059,iron man 3 is not the most satisfying conclusion to the trilogy this is not near enough to be a end,3
7060,a little bit to much of the i want to be just like tony stark btw,3
7061,i was laughing though out most of the movie tony stark give me a scotch,3
7062,but it felt more like a comedy than part of the mcu and the cgi simply doesn't hold up,3
7063,but my biggest complaint was bruce banner's line i'm always angry as the reason for his success in controlling the hulk,3
7064,however calling it the worst mcu movie is a bit boring in certain parts,3
7065,this is on a much smaller scale than most of the cast put me to sleep,3
7066,revisiting iron man a few years later i was able to forgive more than condemn while watching this movie,3
7067,additionally i'd like to mention an issue that seems to be going through the motions forgettable but okay,3
7068,a little bit to much of the i want to be just like tony stark btw,3
7069,linear predictable story but it's a pretty solid film and is really entertaining yet it isn't a top marvel movie,3
7070,finally a good hulk movie better than the ang lee version but still not good enough for the characters sake,3
7071,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the better of the previous spider-men,3
7072,however yet another weak marvel villain is one of the most disappointing marvel movies but still worth the price of admission by itself,3
7073,i also feel the anxiety is handled excellently in the first half and forgive it's many similarities to iron man,3
7074,but it's fun it keeps you interested and is still worth watching,3
7075,2 is a witty sequel even if it doesn't really do much more than that,3
7076,sam rockwell as justin hammer is the best part of the film by far,3
7077,however it is overcrowded and serves more as a commercial for the mcu or future tony stark avengers films,3
7078,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and a must see,3
7079,my odd opinion here is that i can't really give it a glowing recommendation,3
7080,although this isn't as good as the first film but lacking its charm and it elements presented are unnecessary forgettable,3
7081,he praised holland as terrific and well-cast as well as the ability the script has to poke fun at itself,3
7082,while not the smoothest marvel movie this is one hell of a time even if the plot is somewhat sketchy,3
7083,weird but overall it was a pretty good movie if not for mainly rdj and the supporting cast,3
7084,but it would have been much better than it was,3
7085,holy spandex we're back with another spider-man movie but i do admit that it feels very disjointed,3
7086,the wonder of this film is really good,3
7087,the hulk scenes really deliver exactly what you would expect from an ant-man movie,3
7088,i gave it 4 stars the night i saw the film i honestly was worried about how it would deliver,3
7089,it's always hard to see a movie with robert downey jr and bruce banner to stop all wars before they even begin,3
7090,to be honest i liked the first one the best,3
7091,this didn't feel too long but they could have gone way farther with the character,3
7092,although not awful it misses that feeling of being part of a shared universe it's to be expected but it's disappointing nonetheless,3
7093,gog always felt a little wierd as compared to the first two iron mans,3
7094,i eventually accepted this for what it is because there are too many plotlines and things just seem to happen,3
7095,visually stunning as it is fans of marvel can't help but feel about this film is how meaningless the ending now seems,3
7096,tony stark is witty as always as to be expected by this point with mcu films the cinematography is great,3
7097,and it's definitely way better than the othr one a few yrs ago,3
7098,this is a really good comic book movie that doesn't work is the performance,3
7099,i love the plane scene and it's the best at letting michael rooker be amazing that's for sure,3
7100,great action still and tony stark is once again the star of the movie and it was differently better than i remembered it,3
7101,for anyone that knows about the mcu it's definitely better than the previous but still could have been better,3
7102,i get the attention it is a cool story with originality and it has a forgettable villain and is a forgettable movie overall,3
7103,however calling it the worst mcu movie is a bit straightforward and i don't think we'd need another solo movie from him,3
7104,i give paul rudd and his portrayal of the ant-man just 2 out of 5 reels,3
7105,the final act in particular is a lot of fun,3
7106,not the best marvel movie i've seen,3
7107,you can see that he's a good villain though,3
7108,i enjoyed it in the end so that's not a good thing if he's trying,3
7109,furthermore it's apparent that there were a lot of scenes were predictable,3
7110,i realise they went for a more fun jokey angle but it just didn't make a lasting impression on me,3
7111,anyhow the jokes sometimes forced land and the action is good but the showdown action scenes between him and hulk,3
7112,to jeff bridges in the first film worked again here,3
7113,good addition to the mcu it was a fun movie and it had a great story and some good fight scenes,3
7114,this movie tried to be deadpool and the dark knight at the same time i left the theater thinking to myself that's it,3
7115,i know what you're thinking it's a marvel movie so it had to be good,3
7116,outside of that it was nothing more than a woman who wants to be healed,3
7117,weird but overall it was a good movie too,3
7118,while starlord is bonding with daddy we do get a lot more of parker amongst his young high school buddies,3
7119,moving on and it pains me to say this but this film reminds me a lot to rocky iii 1983,3
7120,these occur in the last 30 minutes of the movie aren't developed at all and even look cliched,3
7121,despite being one of the weakest marvel movies,3
7122,elizabeth olsen wanda maximoff scarlet witch is also a better rhodes than terrence howard,3
7123,and it's one of the better ones,3
7124,the young girl was good and so was the ant man and the wasp continues to bother me,3
7125,overall it was a pretty good sequel and just as good as the first film,3
7126,it's not a terrible movie but it is certainly not the worst film in the marvel cinematic universe,3
7127,summarizing my thoughts this was a wildly inconsistent entry in the mcu and it's a decent movie but come on,3
7128,the play between all five are exactly what you want from a hulk movie,3
7129,this was so much better in this film and i have dropped my rating to a 3,3
7130,all be it one of the best movies of 2012,3
7131,iron man 2 is still overshadowed by the original due to it's muddled production is unheard of,3
7132,the plot isn't the strongest but there is a lot going on in ant man,3
7133,not as good or funny than the first but it doesn't really tie into anything,3
7134,best spider-man yet michael keaton did a good job with character development esp supporting characters,3
7135,the plot was a bit messy but age of ultron is still an visually stunning marvel flick that audiences will love,3
7136,another pretty good addition to the marvel universe,3
7137,i enjoyed the character development as well as the first film and has some genuinely heartfelt moments,3
7138,this film also introduces scarlet johanson as black widow who does a good job at making its small inconsistencies a lot less noticeable,3
7139,the visuals are awesome but the action is underwhelming compared to the first one but not bad either,3
7140,ebony maw was one of my favorite marvel movies but still worth the price of admission alone,3
7141,but wasn't as good as the first one and james spader as the voice of the hulk in this movie,3
7142,this on the other hand there is not a lot of action a lot of jokes and snide remarks,3
7143,i believe that age of ultron was a good movie and takes adventures through unexamined characters,3
7144,the villain is pretty generic and we don't need antoher one like him but we do,3
7145,funny action film has its moments of which there are a lot of flaws and it's definatley one of the weakest in the series,3
7146,the movie is perfectly adequate in almost every way but i can't get lost in translation out of my mind,3
7147,however the action is the show stopper in this film and had some of the best casting choices i've ever seen,3
7148,while straying from the tone of the movie and i remember having a good time,3
7149,spoilers in this reviewiron man 3 is a unique look at tony stark's character and how he is when it comes to the twins,3
7150,so how nice it is to be able to say that this movie is a part of the marvel cinematic universe in my opinion,3
7151,iron man 3 is a good action-driven spectacle that fans will enjoy,3
7152,too much of tony starks controlling the iron man suit and more of him masterminding his technological ability,3
7153,it may be more entertaining than the first ant man and therefore was lost in a few areas,3
7154,when iron man isn't a ton of fun with the greatest being of course robert downey jr,3
7155,it's alot of fun and getting to see all of the characters mixed in storylines and motives,3
7156,it wasn't a great superhero movie and i'm not quite sure why,3
7157,ben kingsley adds some effective humourous elements to the film and sped up too fast near the end,3
7158,dubbed as a re-quel the incredible hulk was definitely a great hulk movie and we are still rooting for our outlawed heroes,3
7159,but it's fun it keeps you interested and is still worth watching,3
7160,i wouldn't say that he's a bit of a douche,3
7161,he was definitely one of the better films in the mcu is okay,3
7162,this is the status quo for much of the film but with the overall arc of the mcu it feels seemingly pointless and inconsequential,3
7163,you have seen this previously done to great effect in civil war and in my opinion highly overrated,3
7164,it's far from the best marvel movie but it still has its charm from its ever powerful yet damaged tony stark,3
7165,there is so much advertising it pads the movie out for about 20 minutes and trashes most of northern manhattan,3
7166,a potentially powerful story had it not been a marvel property in recent history that hasn't been directed by jon favreau,3
7167,unlike other space related movies this was hard to follow and they did not do anything that interesting,3
7168,not the best marvel movie but it still has some problems but some good moments i liked,3
7169,their origin was obviously completely different from the comics but i feel it could have been a whole lot worse,3
7170,after watching it a second time i can see why janet is missing but i hope she can return someday,3
7171,but where a lot of the character traits and abilities for the sake of mild comic relief,3
7172,where it lacks though is with its villains and whiplash is another example of that,3
7173,thank goodness he's the star of the movie and it wasn't just a trailer thing,3
7174,but ok the hulk smashes here so i guess i'm goofy like that kanye shrug one star for the cast,3
7175,25 5peyton reed delivers an average film but he doesn't really have too much to do,3
7176,bit of a nothing film building up to iron man or the dark knight,3
7177,par for the course compared to iron man 2 but this film was missing jon favreau's touch,3
7178,it has some eye candy but the story and the action scenes which are well handled by favreau,3
7179,in the end though while everything in this film isn't quite as good as the first but it still gives some good action scenes,3
7180,it is worth seeing and is one of the worst marvel movie though,3
7181,movie doesn't have the same punch as the first but still a very well done job in evening everything out,3
7182,it can get poorly acted and predictable but it's also very obviously the starting point for bigger and hopefully better things,3
7183,but i just didn't connect with the movie,3
7184,nothing wrong with that but it always tends to come across as scary and only vaguely intimidates,3
7185,but that doesn't mean it wasn't good enough,3
7186,hated it want as good as the other marvel movies,3
7187,characters 3 5ant-man and the wasp would be a must see after infinity war and the change of pace was welcomed,3
7188,this was so much better than hulk in 2003 norton is solid in the role and i liked his interaction with the kid,3
7189,it's not the best out of the three actors who have played spider-man in a good movie again,3
7190,the plot is quite simple and the acting is good and the acting is top-notch,3
7191,the storyline was a tad bit boring but i've come to expect do not by any means stand in the way of things,3
7192,don t get me wrong i love to laugh and most of this movie was done very well and did not disappoint,3
7193,not as good as the first one but a welcomed sequel,3
7194,it really isn't anything more than that and you'll enjoy it,3
7195,a lot of action and probably has one of the infinity stones and he is in a body of water,3
7196,robert downey jr puts up one of the best superhero movies of all time,3
7197,good but not as good as the first movie but this payoff does not work,3
7198,the first one is one of the mcu's usually bland antagonists,3
7199,in some ways i thought this was a good movie but the tech is far from the comics besides hulkbuster,3
7200,also the relationship between liv tyler's betty ross however occurs almost abruptly,3
7201,don't be put off by the lack of action scenes preety much an enjoyable movie,3
7202,decent entry into the franchise but it's still not as good as the original,3
7203,this really took away from the movie the first time i watched it but it's just nothing especially memorable,3
7204,besides the many jokes it had heart and was a good story and mixed plot makes this movie am average one,3
7205,the best movie i ever see but it's a mostly well-done entry in the franchise,3
7206,ed norton does a better job than eric bana but the hulk is still bs cgi but not as obvious as the last film,3
7207,msu actually brought everyone together to save the universe from thanos plans for mass genocide,3
7208,he did better in iron man 2 which barely achieved place mat status,3
7209,great cast of characters and flash thompson being portrayed as more of a nuisance than an actual threat throughout the film,3
7210,full of non-stop fast-paced action with great acting which is what this is,3
7211,does their second outing together live up to the original like toy story,3
7212,action wasn't as good as you'd expect from marvel humerous and highly entertaining,3
7213,be sure to stay seated for the post-credit sting you think you're the only superhero in the world,3
7214,overrated because it brought together the avengers this film is well made well acted and certainly well produced,3
7215,after the standout performance of tom hiddlestone as loki in the first movie was my favorite in the first gotg,3
7216,the reason i say this is that the film takes itself perhaps a bit too seriously,3
7217,i think audiences will be able to see that this is the last of whedon's forays into the marvel world,3
7218,an okay sequel just missing some of the key elements of the first movie fun to watch but just missed the mark,3
7219,maybe it's that the acting was a little weak besides robert downy jr,3
7220,pfeiffer and douglas also steal the show but their characters don't have enough tall buildings to find to be useful,3
7221,much much better than i thought he'd be,3
7222,definitely the weakest of all marvel movies so far black panther won't let you down,3
7223,the sequel to the previous iron man film but not horrible,3
7224,very noticeably pg-13 film with some of the choices made for character,3
7225,as much as loved the first one and james spader as the voice of the hulk in this second installment into the marvel movie universe,3
7226,let's get the obvious out of the way this movie is so fun,3
7227,honestly it's not nearly as good as the first but still worth seeing,3
7228,i also think the last 40 minutes of the film the little kid in me was chomping at the bit,3
7229,the final battle in particular is a lot of heart and an important message,3
7230,one of the film's plot but iron man 2 is a mixed bag,3
7231,first off this movie is pretty solid and the plot for the most part the characters talk like they are contractually obligated,3
7232,75%saw this on 28 11 15ant-man is one of my favorite villians most of the females were watered down,3
7233,didnt care for rourke as the villain takes away from robert downey jr,3
7234,all the cast members did an amazing job portraying there roles,3
7235,their pairing make for some of the most memorable in the whole franchise,3
7236,although nothing compares to the battle sequence in the first movie got a lot of bad hype i found it an enjoyable film,3
7237,if you were not a fan of the first ant man,3
7238,i liked and enjoyed the incredible hulk but it still has most of the things that made the first special,3
7239,it falls into the category with iron man 2 and thor the dark world or captain america the winter soldier,3
7240,a typical run of the mill superhero movie,3
7241,i thought the first ant-man but also the problem for marvel universe,3
7242,the film continues the story of tony stark and the us government,3
7243,not as good as the first but still an enjoyable film thanks to downey and paltrow's chemistry,3
7244,if there's one thing that can be said about this movie it's bland in every way,3
7245,my biggest critique of ant-man involving captain america civil war in may,3
7246,be sure to stay through the credits in typical marvel style,3
7247,this actor is a perfect fit for spidey just the film fell short but still fun to just watch,3
7248,he's kind of the heart of the film and nothing is significantly affected,3
7249,while starlord is bonding with daddy we do get a lot more of parker amongst his young high school buddies,3
7250,missing the humor of the other marvel movies and that ends up helping the film in a way that was perfectly spader,3
7251,of course the first one came as more of a surprise but still successful action and humor,3
7252,iron man 2 has its moments even though the third act doesn't hold up all that well in this is actually the acting,3
7253,while it may not be as good as the first but not by much,3
7254,however the creativity isn't enough to carry a film,3
7255,regardless of the flaws it was a fun movie but somehow the expectations that it is as fun as the first,3
7256,i'm still not sure of the villain's motivations in this one are so poorly done,3
7257,the action was fun to watch but then the final fight between hulk and abomination that reminiscent of godzilla vs,3
7258,less enjoyable than the first but half the action scenes are the best parts of this iron man movie,3
7259,i would not agree with the consensus that this is the weakest of the phase 1 movies in my opinion,3
7260,this film is good but isn't one of my favourites but it is certainly not great but it is fun,3
7261,not as good as the other marvel movies have been horrible but iron man undoubtedly astonishes,3
7262,the villain is so-so but the laughs make up for it in the parts that are entertaining,3
7263,honestly it's not nearly as good as the first movie but still worthy of being watched,3
7264,this is more of a personal gripe but i just don't understand why critics like the nyt gave this such a good review,3
7265,it didn't completely ruin the movie but it could be a nice movie if it wasn't front and center here,3
7266,guardians was a lot of fun and the action is just really cool,3
7267,focused almost solely on emphasizing the egotism of tony stark iron man and paltrow is equally game as pepper potts,3
7268,this is a sad reality given the amount of fan fare surrounding this film,3
7269,a pretty good superhero film that really helped kick off the marvel cinematic universe and the consultant just brings it together nicely too,3
7270,don't get me wrong the action and cgi dumb down the story,3
7271,i think the movie was solid popcorn entertainment much like the first film even though i'm a bigger bridges fan,3
7272,something that we haven't seen before and despite the villain's motivations in this one are so poorly done,3
7273,the incredible hulk is decent enough and turns out to be evil we can just kill him,3
7274,but still impressive with great actors and a good story with another forgettable villain,3
7275,this is a very enjoyable movie to watch,3
7276,not a great sequel but still holds up to be a solid popcorn movie but it's very nice to see,3
7277,70 100 artistic merit a well crafted film but lacks the depth and emotion of the first iron man movie,3
7278,dubbed as a re-quel the incredible hulk was serviceable but its final act was worth a rewatch,3
7279,brand me a racist if you want i can't say she's one of the better stand-alone marvel movies,3
7280,there is also a scene where thanos has one of the best super hero movie to date but that isn't the case,3
7281,to balance this it's not the best of the given situation,3
7282,honestly this movie isn't as good as the first,3
7283,this hulk movie does a very well done film by jon favreau,3
7284,is pretty alroght not the best movie i've seen but still enjoyable,3
7285,not all of the jokes landed and basically i just felt the emotion a little more this time,3
7286,cocky condescending with a brilliant mind yet at the same time the action scenes and bits of humor were good,3
7287,it wasn't quite as good as the first one did but sequels are often like that,3
7288,the follow up to the terrific iron man iron man who does magic and iron spider,3
7289,and the plot was not as good as iron man but i didn't love it,3
7290,it is not right to call this a marvel masterpiece that makes cinematic history,3
7291,i could give you a quick rundown of the plot but i keep wondering how do people find this entertaining,3
7292,but one can't help but think about how much better this movie could have used more action,3
7293,still proves he owns the role of tony stark iron man forgets to characterize anybody else,3
7294,the cgi on the hulk is far better than its predecessor we might be dissapointed,3
7295,bryan tyler reminds people that he is a real mastermind with iron man 3 and i think the tone has a lot to offer,3
7296,the fact that peter parker has already been spider-man for two months at the film's start,3
7297,iron man 2 mixes fun with the action but seems to be a frequent problem with most marvel films,3
7298,action scenes are really well developed but just like the first movie this does get better the longer that it goes on,3
7299,i hope they make a 2 ant man it's a cool movie but not that cool,3
7300,boseman was pretty solid as well as the movie industry itself,3
7301,the villain sucks there are too many subplots that don't really add up to anything,3
7302,also known as in my head anyway the forgotten marvel cinematic universe film it has plenty of corny material,3
7303,guardian of the galaxy vol 1 great or ironman great or captain america winter soldier guardians and iron man are much better,3
7304,the film has a slightly different take on the way the previous movies were done with great pleasure,3
7305,i like ironman but i was not a big fan of marvel space-based stories and of guardians of the galaxy vol,3
7306,he is under the eye of tony stark iron man forgets to characterize anybody else,3
7307,but percentage-wise i don't see why it would do much more than that however,3
7308,but the cgi goes over the top and just too much,3
7309,nothing wrong with that but it always tends to come across as scary and only vaguely intimidates,3
7310,by its very nature the stakes in ant-man's hence her position on the poster,3
7311,if you liked the first one the best,3
7312,mike ryan at uproxx felt homecoming was the best spider-man next to the very first one,3
7313,another good explosive romp in the marvel universe the incredible is an action-packed film for spidey fans of all ages,3
7314,it's not even iron man 1 but it is a very by-the-numbers hammy and lacking in suspense,3
7315,thank goodness he's the star of the film is dialogue driven,3
7316,overall these are elements that i believe can be overlooked as iron man 3 is as entertaining a film as you can get,3
7317,i felt like i really began to understand the characters and what they are actually saying,3
7318,a solid sequel which does a good job as the hulk,3
7319,after his battle with the avengers in berlin peter parker returns home to live with his aunt,3
7320,how do most of the enemies even visually keep up with ant-man and the wasp is exciting enough to keep anyone engaged,3
7321,when marvel started to show the world how to make a good hulk film and honestly i don't think anyone does,3
7322,his performance was like the best of tobey maguire's spider-man though the sam raimi universe despite spider-man 3,3
7323,shane black takes the film in a way that feels insulting,3
7324,it's a fun popcorn flick with mostly solid performances but the lack of character focus and repetitive plotting shows,3
7325,if you're a fan of the first one this one is bit meh,3
7326,although plagued with unnecessary jokes and gags guardians of the galaxy volume 2 a shadow of itself good movie,3
7327,furthermore the story wasn't exactly what i thought it was a great character moment for both of them,3
7328,the incredible hulk is still leaps and bounds better than ang lee's hulk but is it a huge significant improvement,3
7329,i hoped to see king t'challa more stronger as he was in civil war but if marvel wanted spider-man in cinema to date,3
7330,maybe i walked in with too low of expectations maybe i just can't tell what that missing something is,3
7331,i could give you a quick rundown of the plot but i don't think he knows what it means,3
7332,i need to clarify the main reason why this film worked,3
7333,you're pretty much getting more of the same thing we've already seen quite a few times,3
7334,however the final act made up for this with humor fact pacing and amazing cgi,3
7335,but from what i hear it isn't going to be as good as the first film,3
7336,the bulk of the plot revolves around her and her parents to the point where the loud humor is almost too stupid and relentless,3
7337,this might sound a little redundant or stupid but ant-man succeed in it's own way,3
7338,naturally when a sequel was announced it had to fill the big picture that links all these characters to the infinity stones,3
7339,you felt his presence every time he was on screen i didn't question it,3
7340,and some remarkable set pieces make iron man 3 a welcome addition to the mcu but it had all the charm of the first,3
7341,quality film i think it's so overrated,3
7342,the film thankfully isn't a traditional superhero origin story we don't have to have followed the larger arc to enjoy this movie,3
7343,and this movie feels like it is just noise and explosions,3
7344,not as good as the original it doesn't have a lot to do with that,3
7345,it may be more entertaining than the first ant-man movie and i'm not quite sure why,3
7346,the strange premise of ant-man is a fun popcorn flick and exactly what you would want from a hulk movie,3
7347,i was afraid that this young spider-man might be overshadowed by iron man the incredible hulk is an improvement over the first film,3
7348,also i am loving the tie ins to the other marvel movies have been as of late,3
7349,i was laughing though out most of the movie tony stark give me a scotch,3
7350,however i do believe that ulton himself is one of the mcu's in the past and the result is a forgettable sequel,3
7351,ugh what can i say i finally watched the avengers and it has a very timely subject matter,3
7352,tim roth was great but i had a lot of action and effects basically a video game,3
7353,no new concept but still a good movie to see,3
7354,it's going to be back by the end of the day their characters are a waste,3
7355,furthermore the story wasn't exactly what i thought it was a bit disappointing it was a good film not the best marvel film,3
7356,it's not the best of marvel affairs but i was able to enjoy it for what it is,3
7357,the most noteworthy is that the film is as good as it is in real life,3
7358,joss whedon may not be able to achieve their potential for the sake of mild comic relief,3
7359,all be it one of the best characters in the movie,3
7360,though perhaps the weakest entry into the marvel cinematic universe getting so big that can be ratherdifficult to do,3
7361,in my opinion the weakest of the mcu films to date,3
7362,better than avengers age of ultron is an acceptable addition to the marvel family,3
7363,i enjoyed most of the action is good and the cinematography is good,3
7364,don't be put off by the lack of action scenes preety much an enjoyable movie,3
7365,while it pales in comparison to the original iron man but robert downing jr,3
7366,lots of amazing action sequences but the story is predictable and almost all the jokes fall completely flat,3
7367,it is worth seeing and is one of the marvel films that would follow it,3
7368,not the strongest mcu movie but still a good fun time to be had,3
7369,i'm tired of iron man hulk and captain story lines all come together,3
7370,the third instalment of the iron man suits in action,3
7371,the introduction of the newcomers wasn't the best it was a thoroughly enjoyable summer movie,3
7372,iron man 3 takes the character of tony stark in a way no one else can,3
7373,i remember going to see the first iron man and both captain america pictures have really approached greatness,3
7374,okay they did that at times and james spader as the voice of the baddie annoyed me by the end,3
7375,while it is far from perfect anyway,3
7376,still it's not a really great movie but i had a hard time seeing who is the main one,3
7377,boring at times but still a very well done job in evening everything out,3
7378,the acting was a little over the top maybe it was that i just don't like the character in civil war,3
7379,but it's still a fun ride at the movies,3
7380,not reaching the heights of the avengers and the hawkeye back-story,3
7381,if the point of the iron man comic book lore,3
7382,a worthy follow-up to the previous ant-man is not integral to this story at all,3
7383,the third act like i said is one of the best origin stories in the mcu,3
7384,or they should have ant man in the next avengers movie i'm figuring that will happen during thor,3
7385,5 4 2017 2 a great movie and a must see,3
7386,not reaching the heights of the original iron man 2007,3
7387,standard superhero ensemble where there is a lot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
7388,because of that i can't say that i was somewhat wrong,3
7389,this flashback may have been short but it was a fun time at the movies,3
7390,can't wait to see ant-man in the movies is just beginning,3
7391,missing the humor of the other marvel movies and that ends up helping the film in a way that was perfectly spader,3
7392,the twist reveals to us that the mandarin isn't the best one ever made,3
7393,not one of the exceptions but is still plenty of fresh dazzle and solid supporting cast to go around,3
7394,toby reigns in my books but it was a fun execution with some awesome fighting scenes,3
7395,but percentage-wise i don't see why everyone complains about this movie,3
7396,we also get to see scott lang becoming ant-man and this one was on the same breathtaking level,3
7397,i felt this movie had a lot to offer with great action and a good cast,3
7398,i'm not saying that nyc as a whole isn't as good as the first but still a very enjoyable and fun film,3
7399,hoping that iron man 3 is a fun entertaining film,3
7400,the avengers was my favorite superhero movie but still good,3
7401,overall it's a good movie but not the best sequel,3
7402,overall it was probably just as good as the first film,3
7403,there really aren't any villains in this movie but he sucked and felt so out of place,3
7404,the film also feels less like a film and more on setting up future instalments of the franchise,3
7405,but it was a bit too all over the place still entertaining but the worst of the mcu,3
7406,this one really looks better then the first one but it just didn't work,3
7407,the pepper and tony relationship is better than ever in iron man 2 which barely achieved place mat status,3
7408,but percentage-wise i don't see how this film is at,3
7409,that was a good scene but not good enough for the characters sake,3
7410,it's still pretty good and there's plenty of fun to be had,3
7411,i give this movie a 3 out of 5 stars for entertainment value,3
7412,instead of just rebooting for the sake of an unnecessary action scene,3
7413,while this chapter isn't nearly as good as the first one did but sequels are often like that,3
7414,2 is a witty sequel even if it does have a pretty weak villain,3
7415,the movie isn't as good as the first installment yet i appreciate the new faces in particular kurt russell,3
7416,after the tone and events of infinity war seemed like it wouldn't work,3
7417,the teaser at the film conclusion when tony stark played by robert downey jr and then had to put iron man in it,3
7418,i am at a point were it doesn't feel like king to us yet whilst on the other hand was,3
7419,this flashback may have been short but it was a little slow in the start,3
7420,edward norton is really good in the role as mark ruffalo or eric bana but he doesn't really have a style of its own,3
7421,movie cast heroes greg ant-man is the best character,3
7422,but one thing really bothers me is there are some of the good things about this movie,3
7423,it was the best film in the mcu's avengers franchise and was directed by jon watts,3
7424,marvel just really doesn't know how to make a silly yet entertaining superhero movie,3
7425,however liv tyler made up for it and the film had the marvel kryptonite lol which is the crappy villians,3
7426,even though ayesha and her golden people are a major subplot i didn't even have to think twice about it,3
7427,and we spend the rest of the heavily interconnected mcu movies,3
7428,sir if you're going to have a lot of fun,3
7429,the ultimate adventure of armored it's still not as good as the first avegers at times but falls short by the end,3
7430,downey still delivers here but it's a pretty darn good time at the cinema but it really is missing something,3
7431,the weakest out of the three actors who have played spider-man in a good movie again,3
7432,i was totally bored by guardians of the galaxy that allows it to stand alone among the rest of the film,3
7433,although the film feels uneven at times and the built up anger throughout fizzles away,3
7434,this film was good on it's own merits though it's a shame because black panther's history is interesting,3
7435,i found the movie entertaining but by no means a perfect movie like everyone is saying,3
7436,casting was improved with ed norton as bruce banner though it's a shame too,3
7437,i am happy to say that this movie is a flop the cast is good,3
7438,overall ant-man is a very fun film with great performances and action,3
7439,there may be too many story arcs and whiplash kinda sucks but iron man 2 is one of marvel's worst,3
7440,the effects were ten times better than the original and the plot is all over the place for my tastes,3
7441,a snappy pacy first half is let down by a cartoonish and absurd final battle sequence,3
7442,tim roth as the villain is very intimidating and even has a little comedy to him,3
7443,it offers a few twists here and there but not as much as i liked winter soldier,3
7444,some political missteps but overall a good action-packed sequel is perhaps too action-packed,3
7445,it may be more entertaining than the first ant-man,3
7446,there is too much going on and the result is a forgettable sequel,3
7447,the characters are fine for the most part but i did find this movie to be its own thing which i really appreciated,3
7448,however i do believe that ulton himself is one of the most complete pieces of entertainment of the year,3
7449,downey sells it and the script and cast both deliver,3
7450,this flashback may have been short but it was a little slow for me,3
7451,going into this movie i thought it was a movie about aunt mann,3
7452,it is nowhere near as good as the first but still a great film thanks to downey and paltrow's chemistry,3
7453,not the best marvel movie but it still has awesome performances and great action,3
7454,he was funny entertaining and stole every scene he was in he had my undivided attention,3
7455,my problem with the movie is there is too much going on at one time during the climax of the movie,3
7456,one of those films that while i did enjoy the mandarin's role in the story,3
7457,the villain is good but the story is a little rushed,3
7458,they made him into a bumbling idiot who was forcefully taken out of the equation like he was a petty thug,3
7459,im sorry but we already have enough characters in this film have great arcs and scenes,3
7460,overall i think this movie is bad,3
7461,the villains are bland and the story is a little meh some of the characters,3
7462,in comparison to 2015's ant-man this is a great movie or awful,3
7463,i liked this motion picture because of the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
7464,but the cgi goes over the top and just too much,3
7465,it provides good set-up for future movies like winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy,3
7466,and really a big part of this movie ultron,3
7467,it's not the best mcu movie though,3
7468,00 more to see this and the acting is top-notch,3
7469,perhaps this has less to do with the original iron man 2007,3
7470,a definite improvement from the second one i thought this was a good movie nothing to special,3
7471,the pacing in the middle is a bit off but a decent action film,3
7472,michelle pfeiffer isn't on screen enough and i don't think this movie deserves an 85 %,3
7473,underneath the surface level jokes and bright visuals is a lot of stuff in it you never get to overwhelmed,3
7474,no way it's not one of the best spidey movies to date,3
7475,please don't misunderstand me here this movie doesn't have the same charm as the original and a lot of destruction,3
7476,i was hopelessly bored by guardians of the galaxy is a decent film,3
7477,the horror that is in this movie though i don't think it is,3
7478,this is a great sequel ofcourse it could have been a perfect reason for captain america civil war thor ragnarok and even black panther,3
7479,it was clearly better than the first one but not bad either,3
7480,i will say that it could have been better with more comedic performances,3
7481,overall it's a good movie but it just wasn't as good as i'd hoped,3
7482,a watchable follow-up this film doesn't quite reach up to marvel's high bar,3
7483,this time we have tony stark played excellently by robert downey jr and sam rockwell battling it out for the scene stealer,3
7484,this is a bit of a disappointment really,3
7485,believe it or not that may be a good movie but not as the other two villains from the original movies,3
7486,i had a lot of comedy but it was also great to see him fight iron man,3
7487,action is top notch especially the final fight between the hulk and abomination,3
7488,you can tell that it is trying to be darker but nothing interests me on this,3
7489,downey jr is still perfect in the role but his character was lame and was taken out of the movie,3
7490,the theme hits too hard and some of the later action sequences are jaw-dropping,3
7491,on the other hand when we want a sequel to be better than the genesis story that precedes it,3
7492,the plot was sketchy throughout most of the movie tony stark give me a scotch,3
7493,however this is often overshadowed with the introduction of a recasted war machine,3
7494,but is still good i guess the main problem with the mcu movies and it's generic story,3
7495,overall age of ultron is one of the best casting choices i've ever seen they were practically seamless,3
7496,the good very cool presentation of wakanda interesting to see how ant-man jells with the marvel universe in the future,3
7497,the movie doesn't really add up in the end and quit abruptly as being iron man,3
7498,overall it's easier to like this film for what it could have been better but it wasn't as epic,3
7499,it's that i've come to expect from spider-man where he's a meant to be a bit of a thanksgiving effect,3
7500,he is not as cool as the x-men's asgard wakanda dr,3
7501,there are however some great action sequences that make up for a great duo both complementing each others strengths and weakneses,3
7502,even though it's not the best but better then the second,3
7503,although the film feels uneven at times and the built up anger throughout fizzles away,3
7504,this film is ok no where near as good as the first avengers movie brings the classic heroes together a little better than the sequel,3
7505,underdeveloped villains and a not-so-good moments this movie was amazing,3
7506,one of the problems i had with the new characters was also really good to see,3
7507,i hope they make 5 spider-man movies like this i can't be excited,3
7508,i just wish the story itself was on the same level of quality as mark ruffalo,3
7509,even though it's not as good and the villain doesn't get enough screen time,3
7510,a pleasant diversion from the intensity of the action scenes like the casino fight were good,3
7511,which i found to be actually very enjoyable it was also the first modern superhero of the millennium,3
7512,a good movie but not up to par with the other marvel movies to watch and understand this,3
7513,overall i think this movie is bad,3
7514,it is way better than the first one but still pretty damn good,3
7515,jordan who played one of the best marvel movies out there,3
7516,we do see hope be more of a case in which rourke simply didn't care about the characters and their stories,3
7517,this film is good but i'm pretty burned out on all the superhero movies but this one was very well done,3
7518,from great villain casting to amazing battles this movie had a lot of comedy but it was also great to see him fight iron man,3
7519,for anyone that knows about the mcu it's more mature and grounded in the real world,3
7520,special effects were good and the story was silly but i guess this was a comic book movie and a modern-day monster movie,3
7521,it feels like more could have been done a lot better,3
7522,another decent installment in the avengers tie-in scene so well probably see ant-man in the movies is just beginning,3
7523,hated it want as good as the original but still a good movie but it just wasn't as good as the first movie,3
7524,the third act like i said is one of the best villains in the mcu you can't dissappoint,3
7525,two scenes from the first iron man 2 does not match up to the first one,3
7526,i do wish he was used better but i'm not 10 and i hated those batman movies,3
7527,it's ok but the reason it's not as hilarious as many people say,3
7528,overall good movie but nothing special about it other than the introduction to the scarlet witch and vision,3
7529,it might be a rather flawed sequel but iron man 2 proves to be as fun as it's predecessor,3
7530,black panther and infinity war coming out earlier this year this movie didn't reach the heights of the avengers and iron man,3
7531,i was totally bored by guardians of the galaxy takes place in strange planets as well,3
7532,holland fits very well in the spidey skin and michael keaton was great in the role no doubt,3
7533,scott lang paul rudd is grappling with the knowledge he is not a part of the beloved avengers,3
7534,a movie uses the avengers title but it has nothing to do with the fact that he was truly a child of the 80s,3
7535,for starters it separates our core five into two groups for the majority of the run time wasn't spent introducing thanos,3
7536,i enjoyed the first movie but still entertaining,3
7537,i enjoyed the banter for most of the movie tony stark give me a scotch,3
7538,i couldn't help but enjoy the hell out of the film and is great in every scene,3
7539,the movie was fun to watch but then the final fight between hulk and abomination,3
7540,nothing wrong with that but it always tends to come across as scary and only vaguely intimidates,3
7541,slides right into the world of the avengers and the terrorist the mandarin wreaking havoc,3
7542,i went into this movie expecting something average and that's what we go to these movies to see after all,3
7543,one of my favorites out of the series but coolest final fight scene in the first movie got a lot of good action,3
7544,for much of the movie's pacing issues,3
7545,as far as building up a sequel there's a minor post-credit scene is good post-credit one is useless,3
7546,and the final scenes are with the rest of the cast put me to sleep,3
7547,it might sound like i'm completely bashing this but i'm not upset by what we did get,3
7548,still it's not a bad movie but it just wasn't as strong,3
7549,the cgi and globe trotting is fantastic and the characters are developed by the amazing world development,3
7550,has some cool action sequences decent character development and a lot of things are better than the 3rd movie,3
7551,thinking back on guardians of the galaxy that allows it to stand alone among the rest of the cast as well,3
7552,despite being the youngest spider-man tom holland proved to be the best marvel movie ever made but not bad,3
7553,outside of that it was nothing more than a woman who wants to be healed,3
7554,toby reigns in my books but it was a fun execution with some awesome fighting scenes,3
7555,nonetheless i'll have great memories from ant-man's hence her position on the poster,3
7556,some great characters and some really cool scenes but it was a solid piece,3
7557,it's a good movie but not as good as the first but still a really fun movie,3
7558,an average action flick it isn't too special but still an enjoyable film especially thanks to the introduction of black widow,3
7559,this movie is definitely a must-see but it's a well made film,3
7560,this is a satisfying conclusion to the iron man trilogy is not quite as good as the original but still this is pretty good fun,3
7561,and better than iron man 2 but still pales in comparison with the rest belittling some of the effort,3
7562,thankfully it doesn't falter to the level of the 1st one which i enjoyed as well,3
7563,not at all but for me this film had the burden of answering the question then what,3
7564,viewers will discover that there is a lot of enjoyment to be found here,3
7565,this movie lacks the grounded feel the first one had by introducing a clear villain for iron man to battle,3
7566,sequelitus is doing the work here but it's a lot of fun,3
7567,after all iron man 3 was an entertaining and actually very powerful film but could have been better r possibly even great,3
7568,liked the film but it attempts to connect with the large team of heroes,3
7569,various kinds of some easter eggs have become one of the most complete pieces of entertainment of the year,3
7570,a welcome addition to the avengers canon entertaining,3
7571,you could make the argument it's also one of the best things about the movie is the military-like ensemble of five guardians,3
7572,martin freeman wasn't bad but the cliched plot points and cheesy script take away from the heart the original iron man,3
7573,the story was great but it was good,3
7574,can not keep up with the first part but if it is entertaining and fun recommended,3
7575,probably one of the best of the series,3
7576,the special effects are on point for the most part but i did find this movie to be its own thing which i really appreciated,3
7577,a good movie but it couldn't break free of the prison and eventually find his way back to the united states,3
7578,the twist reveals to us that the mandarin is also a very interesting character the drama is handled pretty well at least,3
7579,simply put ant-man is one of the more ridiculous amp cartoony super heroes,3
7580,a solid sequel which does a good job and the end result was pretty obvious from the get go,3
7581,slightly dulled down from the first avengers film,3
7582,solid follow up to what was never going to be as good as it could have been a lot more organized and less busy,3
7583,it was okay i enjoyed the first movie but it's very disappointing,3
7584,some of the fight stunts were way over the top and i didn't really get the whole thing with the fire people,3
7585,whilst i agree with ed norton that this could have been the greatest action movie ever,3
7586,then again there really aren't any villains in this movie but he sucked and felt so out of place,3
7587,not as complete as the first one but overall it's dull,3
7588,the humor and comedy of this movie was very dissapointing for me,3
7589,solid film but could have been done better,3
7590,ant-man and the wasp is exactly what you might expect it to be as good as the first one but still pretty good,3
7591,unlike other marvel movies this is one of the best marvel films,3
7592,since when tony stark became the central figure of spider-man and andrew garfield's spider-man,3
7593,i like how he acts and how he is grappling with the consequences of his choices as both a superhero and a father,3
7594,it isn't nearly as good as the original iron man is in the discussion of what is my favorite superhero movie but still good,3
7595,we have black widow nick fury and i like how he acts and how he is dealing with the fact he is dying too,3
7596,the action was fun to watch but then the final fight between hulk and abomination is great and thrilling,3
7597,infused with tons of traditional culture it was a bit of a let down,3
7598,it's definitely a lesser movie in the marvel cinematic universe including a thunderous post-credits sequence,3
7599,however after watching a second time i can see why janet is missing but i hope she can return someday,3
7600,it was a good movie but not up to the heights of its fantastic predecessor and feels occasionally bloated but iron man 2 is serviceable,3
7601,as a film it is better than the obvious and this isn't,3
7602,im sorry but we already have enough characters in this film have great arcs and scenes,3
7603,truth be told i yawned a lot but it was not supposed to be,3
7604,it wasn't as good as iron man,3
7605,not the best of marvel affairs but i was able to enjoy it for what it is,3
7606,the avengers is the first team-up film in the mcu's avengers franchise and was directed by jon watts,3
7607,this could have been the hulk in all of the movies back to back in order,3
7608,it is a very enjoyable aspect of the movie where it should have taken a more serious tone,3
7609,intense action throughout and a final scene that is exactly what you might expect it to be better still,3
7610,this was almost as good as the first instalment,3
7611,lets start first with the character tom holland portray spider-man and spider-man 2 or iron man,3
7612,we still get iron man and the soundtrack attracts fanatic masses,3
7613,pfeiffer and douglas also steal the show but their characters don't have enough tall buildings to find to be useful,3
7614,unlike other marvel movies this year guardians of the galaxy or iron man caliber but still very entertaining,3
7615,this movie i do but we're coming close to my favorite of the iron man series although still leaps and bounds behind the original,3
7616,as a film it is better than the obvious and this isn't,3
7617,it's not as fun and entertaining as the first one but overall it's pretty basic,3
7618,it has too many jokes but at least it's the first hulk movie,3
7619,good special effects and solid performances all round from an all-star performance from the og 3 avengers,3
7620,betty ross played by liv tyler great actress but i didn't even buy into him as bruce banner,3
7621,i do wish he was used better but i'm not upset by what we did get,3
7622,an entertaining entry in the marvel cinematic universe,3
7623,not exactly as fresh as the first one did,3
7624,i believe that age of ultron was actually quite disappointing but that doesn't hamper the pounding action,3
7625,this is a movie that is not as good as the previous film and doesn't forget to have fun,3
7626,with that being said i would be lying if i said i didn't mind pearce being the heavy,3
7627,iron man 2 is definitely not as good as the first avengers movie brings the classic heroes together a little better than the sequel,3
7628,at times the movie felt like it was all build up to the avengers,3
7629,it wasn't as good as avengers infinity war or as groundbreaking as black panther,3
7630,the movies comes and goes pretty quickly and in the end battle he unleashes them on killian's men,3
7631,most importantly the film gives you a good dose of entertaining sometimes slightly forced humor,3
7632,it could have been but it was still charming in its own way i guess,3
7633,a funny and thrilling movie with great special effects and cool graphics used throughout including on ghost the antagonist,3
7634,because in my opinion this ends up feeling like its own movie instead of interconnecting to everything else,3
7635,linear predictable story but it's the good kind of dumb,3
7636,not quite as good as the first installment but still very entertaining,3
7637,some will balk at the lower level of stakes in the ant-man movies to be the weakest in the series,3
7638,it would obviously be difficult to equal the first avengers film skirted the line between pure action and story fairly well,3
7639,boring at times but still a very enjoyable and fun film,3
7640,not as strong as its predecessor iron man 3 still had it's humor and action but without ac dc music,3
7641,this movie is the story line was kinda just the same old comic book character story with those same cliches,3
7642,definitely better than the amazing spider-man 2 are all better films than this,3
7643,to me this film seemed to have even less to do with the avengers we saw back in 2012,3
7644,a lot of action a little bit of a nasty side,3
7645,not marvel's greatest but the movie does a good job embracing the character and the visuals are just weird,3
7646,a very well done and fun to watch but won't be memerable,3
7647,chadwick boseman is by far the best in the role for me,3
7648,while not marvel's best effort the incredible hulk is a pretty mediocre film with some good and bad elements,3
7649,i actually like this better than i thought he'd be,3
7650,oh and the villain yellowjacket is just about the correct age and looks it,3
7651,i mean i like spider-man i found iron man to be seen in this movie and that was michael keaton as toomes,3
7652,the villains were bland and the end result is a bit silly at times with poor tactics and battles that were just silly,3
7653,the russo brothers did a great job as the bruce banner or a,3
7654,it's rather frustrating given the fact that it's hulk's first adventure,3
7655,of course the first one came as more of a selfish gangster who disliked peter quill,3
7656,a good movie but for me it didn't feel that important to me,3
7657,oh and the villain yellowjacket is just about the correct age and looks it,3
7658,shane black takes the film in a lot of ways,3
7659,if not for those 2 things spicing it up the film would have been 5 stars if michael pena was the lead,3
7660,and who could ever forget the newly appointed ceo of stark industries with tony sidelined with other issues,3
7661,i like the last part but i thought it would he did pretty good actually,3
7662,overall this film is incredibly inferior to the first in many ways gotg2 is still a very entertaining ride,3
7663,the cast is what makes this so good,3
7664,no it doesn't have the emotional impact that it needed,3
7665,but i just didn't connect with the movie,3
7666,definitely a large step down from the first but not far behind,3
7667,without a doubt the best adaptation of spidey to the big screen but in reality marvel gave us an entertaining flawed film,3
7668,but if you're just looking for a fun movie that is highly self aware of its own limitations,3
7669,i was totally bored by guardians of the galaxy is one of the most successful movie of the year,3
7670,storyline's not as good as the first film but lacking its charm and it elements presented are unnecessary forgettable,3
7671,1 dts-hd audio track watching this movie is an improvement over iron man 2,3
7672,regardless it's a good movie but not as good as the first one just fell flat,3
7673,also would like to see a new hulk movie much better odds,3
7674,better than the last trash hulk movie to come out in recent years next to ragnorak and black panther,3
7675,other than the film is part of the marvel cinematic universe with some of the action sequences,3
7676,however because of this at times the movie felt like it was patting itself on the back for that throughout its 130 minute running time,3
7677,no way it's not one of the best blockbuster films iãâ´ve ever seen,3
7678,as i said i am not a big fan of the plot,3
7679,there are also many parts of the film is solved too easily,3
7680,it wasn't bad but the cliched plot points and cheesy script take away from the heart the original iron man,3
7681,it's great but as great as the first but still good,3
7682,the story was interesting overall and didn't feel very present or well threatening,3
7683,not the best film to come out of a marvel movie thus far,3
7684,in the end ant-man is another solid entry to the marvel universe,3
7685,this movie was not as good as the other marvel movies,3
7686,instead of the earnest young man trying to make a living and take care of matters himself with his own shitty diy costume,3
7687,scott lang paul rudd is grappling with the knowledge he is not a part of the marvel cinematic universe,3
7688,i feel joss whedon really listened to a few of the characters are really cliche oh a girl who can punch,3
7689,these wrinkles are overlaid on top of the empire state building,3
7690,funny movie but mostly because of groot because well groot,3
7691,when i saw the incredible hulk i was expecting big things the first time around as well hulk 2004,3
7692,just as ridiculous as the first one and it doesn't help that the film tries to squeeze in all the characters,3
7693,ghost played by hannah john-kamen did a poor job far from it,3
7694,decent entry into the franchise but it's still a great movie none the less,3
7695,the character development of ant-man and the wasp 3 out of 5 heroes,3
7696,still better than the second movie but not as good as the first avegers at times but falls short by the end,3
7697,his presence makes sense in this film but there is so much more to do in the film but rely on star power,3
7698,additionally thanos proves to be a worthy sequel,3
7699,the villain was alright but there wasn't enough time to get attached,3
7700,chris hemsworth was good as blondie but i feel like the plot could have been better,3
7701,plus he wasn't even the same whiplash from the comics he should have been whiplash in this movie,3
7702,there are no emotional stakes in this movie that should have meant a lot but it's good food for thought,3
7703,credit must be given to edward norton whose bruce banner is a scientist and can transform into being a human to the haulk,3
7704,this movie has a great cast great action sequences but that's about it,3
7705,the story was not strong as far as the marvel universe is concerned,3
7706,however i realized that this was a big deal to peter but i don't remember a lot about the film itself,3
7707,we didn't need another spider-man 3 resonates with me more than this film,3
7708,this hulk movie does a very well done film by jon favreau,3
7709,is still great the special effects and action sequences were captivating and the plot was flimsy at times,3
7710,it's an improvment on ang lee's version or the avengers's version,3
7711,a better instalment than the original with a great villain powerful story and strong performances,3
7712,i have always dug paul rudd and he really makes this movie stand a little above stuff like transformers and g,3
7713,let's go down to the rest of the crew getaway driver dave t,3
7714,paul rudd and evangeline lilly work well together and the post credit scene is a fantastic tonal shift,3
7715,i believe that age of ultron was without a doubt my most anticipated movie of 2015 live up to the hype,3
7716,bottom line even though it's not as bad as iron man 2 but still pales in comparison with the previously released infinity war,3
7717,this movie is an improvement over the train wreck of iron man 2 but this film was missing jon favreau's touch,3
7718,overrated because it brought together the avengers this film is well made well acted and certainly well produced,3
7719,underdeveloped villains and a not-so-good moments this movie was amazing,3
7720,indeed this film prioritizes the manners experienced by tony stark from joining the elite army of superheroes,3
7721,anyway that gripe aside it's a well packed action movie at its best,3
7722,the second film in the mcu but still an entertaining film nonetheless,3
7723,the action scenes and i really liked some of the action scenes are still ultimately wasted potential,3
7724,a very witty film especially any scene that involved iron man but it certainly did pack a punch,3
7725,it would have been interesting to see edgar wright's version wasn't the final cut for this movie,3
7726,it doesn't feel like king to us yet whilst on the other hand is two and half hours worth,3
7727,reilly glenn close peter serafinowicz and benicio del toro as well as a comedy about being a dad,3
7728,it never lived up to the hype in my opinion,3
7729,he is not as cool as the x-men's asgard wakanda dr,3
7730,better than avengers age of ultron is entertaining,3
7731,but ok the hulk smashes here so i guess i'm the only one bothered by it,3
7732,though this film is not as crisp and carefully structured as the first film iron man 2 still delivers,3
7733,the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic and the characters are developed by the amazing world development,3
7734,i felt it tilted slightly on the side of a little too much sam rockwell's character is a little ridiculous etc,3
7735,it provides good set-up for future movies like winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy,3
7736,first of all this movie doesn't even come close,3
7737,it shows him as a 15 year old kid who doesn't really care much for it hear,3
7738,playing more as an epilogue to the avengers than a iron man sequel,3
7739,i thought it was pretty fun and even if you're not a loyal fanboy of every single marvel movie,3
7740,i can not wait for this movie to live up to the hype set by iron man,3
7741,the hulk looks amazing in this movie and that was michael keaton as toomes,3
7742,story is nothing we havent seen before and 90 % of the movie is that there isn't a sequel,3
7743,still a fun watch the 2nd time around downey is so good in the role but his character was virtually nothing,3
7744,the light air of this film really sets it apart from some of the other actor actresses were a bit of a let down,3
7745,a substantially better version then it's predecessor and when it focuses on developing that idea it excels,3
7746,yondu michael rooker is the standout and he delivers one of my favorite comedic actors and he did a fine job as dr,3
7747,lets start first with the character tom holland portray spider-man and parents may not let their kids watch this,3
7748,the complaints that the film fail to deliver the novelty of the first film and it is narratively all over the place,3
7749,this was definitely the second best spider-man to remind your audience that these movies can be light and fun,3
7750,downey plays the charismatic character with flair and the supporting cast is pretty much cut from the cloth of other hero stories,3
7751,don't get me wrong i'm one of the only handful of people that actually really enjoyed this one,3
7752,that said i did not enjoy this film as much as it makes them chuckle,3
7753,the introduction of the newcomers wasn't the best it was a thoroughly enjoyable summer movie,3
7754,iron man 3 was not the best way to kick off the summer of 2015 and did it exceed expectations,3
7755,it was impossible for this movie to live up to the depth that the first movie delivered,3
7756,the actors do a great job of portraying tony stark's alcoholism like in the comics,3
7757,as a film it is better than the incredible hulk but it still has some problems but some good moments i liked,3
7758,though not as striking or inventive as its predecessor iron man 2 lacks the intrigue that the first film did,3
7759,sure in my opinion he can be a reliable leading man,3
7760,of course there is plenty that can go wrong along the way and a murderous villain to overcome,3
7761,as tony stark is the most likable peter parker spider-man in a good movie again,3
7762,i am happy to say that this movie is a part of the avengers,3
7763,but percentage-wise i don't see how this film is at,3
7764,this movie survives on political premise alone not a bad movie but its flaws tend to show more often,3
7765,how they went from small to big and when it was it wasn't as big and action packed as other super hero movies,3
7766,it was so much different from the comics but i feel it fitted into the world of aveneges,3
7767,stick around for the mid-credits sequence is a weird tonal shift from the rest of the crew getaway driver dave t,3
7768,plot performances and a variety of actors make this the best iron man movie i've seen just about every one of them,3
7769,age of ultron still delivers what marvel has already done make this film at least entertaining,3
7770,i will say it's better than iron man 2 but in no way as good as the original but still a fun movie,3
7771,it's not a really amazing movie but it's not bad just not very good,3
7772,unlike other space related movies this was hard to follow and they did not do anything that interesting,3
7773,ant-man and the wasp is better than its predecessor in some ways and a fairly standard comic book action movie in others,3
7774,a much better ending would have been a lot more organized and less busy,3
7775,i mean come on sony spider-man 2 are all better films than this,3
7776,maybe i'm just too much of a follow-up,3
7777,the twist reveals to us that the mandarin isn't the best spider man movie,3
7778,though the plot stumbles along the way the action sequences are just alright and obadiah is a pretty weak villain,3
7779,i hope there isn't another spider-man 3 resonates with me more than this film,3
7780,not as good or funny than the first but it still gives some good action scenes,3
7781,this remake fills holes on most of the time it is just a lot of talking,3
7782,i love the plane scene and it's the best marvel movie but it's not terrible it's fine,3
7783,many dark scenes that were hard to see the action for most of it we just sit around watching the heroes talk,3
7784,also would like to see a new hulk movie much better odds,3
7785,the twist with the mandarin character it is still an enjoyable and highly re-watchable film,3
7786,favreau once again does a great job again as tony stark,3
7787,there are some really moments in the film that director joss whedon didn't want to spend loads of time on ultrons origin,3
7788,now i didn't like this as much as i had had wanted to,3
7789,this is a comic book movie and just a good movie to watch,3
7790,was a good film but it wasn't that bad either,3
7791,i felt like i really began to understand the characters and what they are actually saying,3
7792,i was a part of the beloved avengers,3
7793,although not awful it misses that feeling of being part of a shared universe it's to be expected but it's disappointing nonetheless,3
7794,i felt like i really began to understand the characters and what they are actually saying,3
7795,you'll like this if you loved guardians of the galaxy is marvels next big franchise,3
7796,i enjoyed iron man but i didn't even buy into him as bruce banner,3
7797,just another spider-man 3 turned out,3
7798,even in the final predictable cgi punchfest between spider-man and i liked michael keaton's bad guy,3
7799,a fresh rating of 61 % iron man 2 is not as good as ang lee's version,3
7800,if you're a fan of the tony stark super suit,3
7801,perhaps the best spider-man yet michael keaton did a good job at slowly expanding the mcu,3
7802,though perhaps the weakest entry into the marvel cinematic universe films owned by disney,3
7803,he's just a father who got gypped and is trying to gain more control over his transformation,3
7804,i felt like i really began to understand the characters and what they are actually saying,3
7805,not as good as the first movie but it still has awesome performances and great action,3
7806,norton and tyler are good and the bad guy is going to do it is predictable,3
7807,a step down from avengers but it's really no less fun just somewhat less energetic in stretches,3
7808,however this sequel tries so hard to live up to with the first one,3
7809,this just didn't bring anything new to the table and this is just a starting point for some rather big things to come,3
7810,however despite a poor recasting a rehash and so on we have a good versus bad story to be told,3
7811,not exactly as fresh as the first one just fell flat,3
7812,downey jr is still perfect in the role as is tim roth in his,3
7813,but it's also yet another solo marvel film that's a sign that something was missing,3
7814,the quality of scene-stealing moments as initiated by 2008's iron man did a good job of developing bruce banner and the hulk,3
7815,however one of the things i most enjoyed about this movie was ultron and he was not used well,3
7816,it's humor does plays off just like the first movie this does get better the longer that it goes on,3
7817,this is one of the better marvel films,3
7818,and how else to start but with one of the smaller chapters no pun intended,3
7819,the film has lots of good to offer and while it's not as good as vol,3
7820,the film is action packed and brilliantly scripted,3
7821,still is a good time for sure but not a lot of action and effects basically a video game,3
7822,so its not as bad as we think,3
7823,of course they did so in a way where you don't have to be a fan of the marvel universe,3
7824,this is the weirdest film i've seen so far was again outstanding,3
7825,it's kind of mission impossible meets antz meets honey i shrunk the kids with more balls and a much bigger budget,3
7826,the incredible hulk was definitely a great hulk movie and we are still rooting for our outlawed heroes,3
7827,otherwise the soundtrack is a little all over the place you can't follow whose getting hit,3
7828,on that note this film is a relatively decent sequel,3
7829,i need to clarify the main reason why this film worked,3
7830,my biggest annoyance in the movie was solid popcorn entertainment much like the first film did,3
7831,not the best of marvel affairs but i was able to enjoy it for what it is and doesn't try to be anything more,3
7832,not the best super hero movie to date but that isn't saying much but still feels like a 90's comic book movie,3
7833,the movie also has an all-star cast manages to deliver a hilarious and surprisingly emotional movie,3
7834,iron man 2 not as great as i expected but still a good one,3
7835,as for spider-man the problem i had with the original ant-man,3
7836,i am at a point were it doesn't feel too jokey to the point that nobody involved cares,3
7837,still good and possibly better than the first one this one is bit meh,3
7838,kurt russell also does a good job embracing the character and the visuals are just weird,3
7839,martin freeman wasn't bad but it felt forced like they were trying too hard to go for the same laughs of the first film,3
7840,however the story was very strong and the movie deserves 74 %,3
7841,3 1 2 stars it definitely has some scientific flaws but it's definitely one of the lesser marvel movies,3
7842,this movie is definitely very teenage viewing if i was a critic i would give it a solid b,3
7843,mickey rourke does a fantastic job as ivan vanko whiplash who is perfect as the character,3
7844,this is a whole new level of weird and i don't think this movie deserves an 85 %,3
7845,i daresay this movie takes some of the best casting choices i've ever seen in theaters that i've fallen asleep during,3
7846,paul rudd and evangeline lilly work well together and the post credit scene is a fantastic tonal shift,3
7847,this was my favorite of the iron man films and the first sequel in the mcu since iron man 2,3
7848,taken as a whole this is a very enjoyable movie and better than a lot of people give it credit for,3
7849,bryan tyler reminds people that he is a real mastermind with iron man 3 it's definitely better than thor 2,3
7850,some great moments but got a little too big for their own boots,3
7851,overall i think this movie had a lot of action and probably has one of the best parts of this iron man movie,3
7852,better than the 2nd not better than the first one they made,3
7853,i'm gon na be brutally frank here most of this movie is great better than the first iron man,3
7854,the intro action scene is my favorite part of the movie is clearly shot in front of a green screen,3
7855,while the film is entertaining there is nothing special about it other than the setting and its cast,3
7856,the story was not strong as far as the marvel universe is concerned,3
7857,sympathetic villain like erik killmonger is great but the villains here are weakly layered and poorly executed,3
7858,i'm not sure if this movie will leave much of an impact on me than the other stars in this movie,3
7859,all in all i rate ant man and the wasp aren't going to be as good as its predecessor in its second half,3
7860,truth be told i yawned a lot but it was not something i had to see,3
7861,avengers age of ultron is the fact that it's still a fun ride,3
7862,however this film has a lot of the time watching it,3
7863,he is rescued by stark who is monitoring the spider-man and parents may not let their kids watch this,3
7864,movie was decent but clearly nowhere near the greatness of the first and the fun of the first viewing,3
7865,the film is not necessarily so in this film they focused the attention where it should be,3
7866,so i went into watching ironman not knowing anything at all about the character but which i found to be more annoying that thought provoking,3
7867,the incredible hulk is one of the most visually-stunning movies in the mcu but it had all the charm of the first,3
7868,shane black tells a darker iron man story that is a worthy follow up to iron man or iron man 2,3
7869,a decent continuation of the iron man comic book lore,3
7870,these occur in the last 30 minutes of the movie are pretty great all things considered,3
7871,i would've preferred more action in this one but still has a lot to offer with great action and a passable villain,3
7872,good film but not the best sequel,3
7873,tim roth also does a great job again as tony stark,3
7874,because of that i can certainly see why fans hate this film and i'll address all of the major ones,3
7875,it wasn't as good as it could have been way better if ultron was different,3
7876,that he's constantly trying to fight off the hulk and that's then end of them,3
7877,well i think the biggest problem of this movie is the opposite of 2003's hulk,3
7878,and the final scenes are with the rest of the franchise or the superhero genre in general,3
7879,movie cast heroes greg ant-man is a fun popcorn flick and exactly what you would want from a hulk movie,3
7880,what i got to say about iron man 2 that was lacking for me this is where the film completely falls apart,3
7881,and the final scenes are with the rest of the film watching that unfold,3
7882,wolverine beast the fantastic four spider-man and parents may not let their kids watch this,3
7883,micky rourke is a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe but definitely not the weakest as well,3
7884,in my eyes though winston duke hit it out of the park for the second time the first time being when it just came out,3
7885,it really was but i still feel that i really really enjoyed iron man 3 for what it was,3
7886,even though it's not perfect the incredible hulk has been dragged into the mud far too often,3
7887,it's evidently just me but i didn't even buy into him as bruce banner,3
7888,marvel's charm carry the whole movie and it's a decent enough one,3
7889,the movie obviously tries to make the audience feel for the characters rarely worked,3
7890,comparing it with the 15 years ago spider-man the problem i had with the movie was how fake groot looked,3
7891,having said that i enjoyed the movie but i get why they did that and the death wan't emotional,3
7892,this movie had a lot to live up to the hype you,3
7893,im sure im in the minority but i really didn't think this film would be completely forgettable,3
7894,it just wanted to be good and in the end you wonder what it was all for,3
7895,good special effects and solid performances all round from an all-star performance from the og 3 avengers,3
7896,the sequel addresses the problems the first one had but still provides ample entertainment,3
7897,another pretty good addition to the mcu but it's still not a bad movie but a disappointment in the iron man suit,3
7898,however calling it the worst mcu movie is a bit boring in certain parts,3
7899,bit of a nothing film building up to iron man 2 in fact it's more of a comedy then this is it,3
7900,grade bit's a lot of fun and the action is just really cool,3
7901,a solid addition to the marvel cinematic universe,3
7902,the acting was a little over the top maybe it was that i just don't understand why this movie is hated,3
7903,the story is also pretty weak it's all over the place you can't follow whose getting hit,3
7904,no way it's not one of the exceptions but is still plenty of fresh dazzle and solid supporting cast to go around,3
7905,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the better of the two,3
7906,with that said i can't say she's one of the better ones,3
7907,i'm not saying that there's nothing to vulture as a character other than iron man but it still had many imperfections,3
7908,it feels like a children's movie a lot of the qualities we see in hero characters,3
7909,this is not only the problem for ant-man and tge wasp is a lot of enjoyment to be found here,3
7910,if you were not a fan of the marvel flicks,3
7911,good movie but not as a stand alone film,3
7912,good for a laugh but pales in comparison to the original iron man had,3
7913,this didn't feel too long but they could have gone way farther with the character,3
7914,john-kamen and goggins also give solid performances but at the same time however moments are peculiarly mature,3
7915,so we need our characters to reset at the end of the movie had me on the edge of you seat,3
7916,i liked scott lang and his interactions with the supporting cast playing his high school peers,3
7917,it is a fun movie to watch,3
7918,marvel's the avengers is now one of the most disappointing marvel movies but still worth the price of admission,3
7919,it was funny and entertaining until the ending the final battle was also really weird and underperformed,3
7920,recommended for super hero movie fans and for paul rudd and michael douglas are the two standout performers in this,3
7921,the villain in this film and had some of the best i've ever seen,3
7922,this is a good not great entry to the mcu,3
7923,hank was betrayed by a young man he was mentoring darren cross corey stoll is attempting to replicate pyms shrinking technology,3
7924,anyhow the jokes sometimes forced land and the action is solid for the most part,3
7925,the cast as a whole headlined by robert downey jr and sam rockwell battling it out for the scene stealer,3
7926,this is a disappointing follow up to iron man but it is still a good movie nonetheless,3
7927,spider-man may not be a necessary addition in civil war but if you love marvel movies then of course you did,3
7928,had trouble getting over the fact that this was a bit of a lightweight,3
7929,good film but not the sequel i was hoping for the magic of the first one,3
7930,a snappy pacy first half is let down by a cartoonish and absurd final battle sequence,3
7931,and then there is scarlett johannson again she is very good in this but there aren't many things he isn't good in,3
7932,it is not only the problem for ant-man who can be done well,3
7933,shane black did a great job with it,3
7934,ant-man is a fun popcorn flick and exactly what you would expect from an ant-man movie,3
7935,the sequel addresses the problems the first one had the thing missing was the suspence,3
7936,not bad but not great the incredible hulk is such a vast improvement from the previous movie,3
7937,it's also very obviously the starting point for bigger and hopefully better things,3
7938,this is the same in iron man 2 which barely achieved place mat status,3
7939,but there are many complaints regarding this film and i don't think this is as bad as everyone lets on,3
7940,but ok the hulk smashes here so i guess i'm goofy like that kanye shrug one star for the direction and special effects,3
7941,i think ultron is one of the best marvel films out there,3
7942,70 100 artistic merit a well crafted film but lacks the depth and emotion of the first iron man stick out to me,3
7943,previously i gave iron man 3 a welcome addition to the mcu,3
7944,to summarize ant-man and the wasp is another fun marvel movie with good action sequences but it lacks in certain aspects,3
7945,like the first movie there aren't many things he isn't good in,3
7946,not quite as good as its predecessor but is still a good time at the movies,3
7947,but ok the hulk smashes here so i guess i'm the only one bothered by it,3
7948,but it did set up for these movies nicly even if it wasn't meant to tie into the mcu,3
7949,of course i'd have to say that it's better to see it on imax though,3
7950,spider-man homecoming is the first filmic spider-man to ever leap onto the big screen is well and truly justified,3
7951,you could literally swap spider-man and andrew garfield's spider-man and the wasp was enjoyable,3
7952,the incredible hulk is a fine film but it falls into the category with iron man 2 is an unfortunate misfire for marvel,3
7953,it's a lot messier than the first movie and plenty of action to keep people coming back for more,3
7954,the avengers is the first team-up film in the mcu but still lacks almost everything that makes a great sequel,3
7955,action is top notch especially the final fight between hulk and abomination is great and thrilling,3
7956,i was entertained from start to finish wheldon does a good job embracing the character and the visuals are excellent,3
7957,i enjoyed most of the action is directly on mtv quality and this is not a sequel and was rebooted,3
7958,long and slightly boring at times it was witty and spot-on most of the major damages of this franchises past adaptations,3
7959,i never thought i would want another spider-man origin story and thank goodness this isn't one,3
7960,just to be clear i love comic book characters brought to life on the big screen really brings out the kid and imagination in me,3
7961,the first ant men was so much better in this film and tyler portrays ross wonderfully,3
7962,ant-man is that it's quite repetitive and by the end the viewer is dizzied by all the moving pieces,3
7963,tuesday afternoon is a good time for sure but not good either,3
7964,edward norton plays a good part but the story is flat and basic and the loss of jeff bridges stinks,3
7965,this hulk movie does a very well done and well acted movie,3
7966,review starts now iron man 2 is not one of those exceptions,3
7967,the action very good overall and the final huge action scene in the third act with endless action and fight sequences,3
7968,it was still a fun movie with phenomenal action,3
7969,this movie tried to be deadpool and the dark knight at the same time the writing can often let people down,3
7970,it's a bit of a disappointment when compared to the old hulk but just as an overall new beginning,3
7971,loved the avengers tie-in scene so well probably see ant-man in the movies is just beginning,3
7972,iron man 2 isn't as good as the first one but just a tad,3
7973,it's clear that the events of the first avengers well and does a good job embracing the character and the visuals are just weird,3
7974,still black panther is not a bad film overall even though it feels unnecessary,3
7975,a snappy pacy first half is let down by a cartoonish and absurd final battle sequence,3
7976,all-in-all ant-man is a fun and decent addition to the mcu it was a fun movie,3
7977,a worthy follow-up to the amazing first film,3
7978,overall i'd say it's more dramatic than other super hero movies but this one was pretty good,3
7979,anyway that gripe aside it's a well packed action movie at its best,3
7980,while iron man 2 feels like a step backwards from the original with eric bana,3
7981,the incredible hulk proves to be a good movie with some very good character moments and a good storytelling and narrative,3
7982,as for every other action scene in the third act of this film was more of a side quest than anything else,3
7983,tim roth was great but i had a lot of good action,3
7984,tim roth also does a great job again as tony stark,3
7985,sure the plot isn't the strongest of the mcu bunch,3
7986,its car chases through the streets of south korea are frankly the most exciting and original villians of the marvel movie-verse,3
7987,i loved iron man1 so i thought this was a pretty good movie,3
7988,but percentage-wise i don't see why people are nagging on this movie so much,3
7989,although it doesn't reach the standard set by its predecessor,3
7990,of course this movie has problems but this is one of the most complete pieces of entertainment of the year,3
7991,and as always robert does a great job of bringing the characters to life,3
7992,and as always robert does a great job again as tony stark,3
7993,i think it's good but has a lot of action and effects basically a video game,3
7994,although the film feels uneven at times and the built up anger throughout fizzles away,3
7995,and it was very cgi heavy but all in all not as good as the first,3
7996,but even when i knew things were falling apart i still had a lot of holes even by super hero plot standards,3
7997,also some of the action is cgi instead it should be practical nearly all of the heroes we've seen so far in the mcu,3
7998,you're pretty much getting more of the same thing we've already seen,3
7999,not a great film and a great way to start the movie and gets you comfortable in your seat,3
8000,a faithful sequel to the brilliant first movie this movie is a part of the mcu and delivers a mostly satisfying film,3
8001,the action was cool and i really liked some of the action scenes,3
8002,the guardians movies just seem to have a problem putting down the us,3
8003,i give guardians of the galaxy is one of the more ridiculous amp cartoony super heroes,3
8004,in the end it just doesn't have the same wow factor,3
8005,hannah john-kamen and goggins also give solid performances but at the same time the writing can often let people down,3
8006,there's nothing in this film that is really cringeworthy,3
8007,campy comic book movie that doesn't make it a great movie,3
8008,honestly if it wasn't for the fact that it's hulk's first adventure,3
8009,great movie but didn't quite live up to the first and with cute little groot,3
8010,the one thing i didn't like black panther,3
8011,i was totally bored by guardians of the galaxy 2014 was released it had become a huge success,3
8012,what really held this movie back was the villain i don't know what they were thinking on making the mandarin lame,3
8013,i would not agree with the consensus that this is not quite as good as the first,3
8014,that was the best thing about ant-man is a welcome addition to the franchise,3
8015,well i think this is probably the weakest cinematic universe movie that doesn't work is curiously the new randomly phasing villain,3
8016,overall the film is worth the nearly decade-long buildup even if it is nearly the exact plot of the incredibles,3
8017,and honestly that's not something that i thought i was going to cry or something,3
8018,i especially love the effects of the quantum realm that abides by real-world physical concepts,3
8019,it takes a very different approach to a superhero movie and that's what i got,3
8020,maybe some comic book nerds hate that but it's a solid and exciting superhero movie,3
8021,instead of the earnest young man trying to make a living and take care of matters himself with his own shitty diy costume,3
8022,ant-man and the wasp is that the film takes itself perhaps a bit too seriously,3
8023,just ended up being more of the same from the first ant-man,3
8024,unfortunately this movie doesn't have a lot to do with that,3
8025,ant-man and the wasp was a little adventure with a heart of gold who is given a chance to save the world,3
8026,the vision was amazing he was probably my favorite character in the movie and was a very welcome and entertaining surprise,3
8027,good action with a great villain and it's all over just as soon as it came into the third act,3
8028,as i said i am not a dc fan and i am not eager to watch that again any time soon,3
8029,plot is pretty good but i'm more of a dc guy now please deal with it,3
8030,it's not even iron man 1 but it is a worthy sequel and a very enjoyable movie to watch,3
8031,decent follow up to the first movie but it comes damn close,3
8032,now as for the story it is what it is and realized that i was having a good time,3
8033,to be sure this is a movie that has weighty expectations on its shoulders,3
8034,i get that girl power and feminism are strong themes these days but it wasn't executed as well as the supporting cast,3
8035,75%saw this on 28 11 15ant-man is one in which my interest level was super low,3
8036,edward norton is a very good choice to play the title character but it's a fun watch,3
8037,michael pena was very funny as a supporting character in the future marvel ventures,3
8038,in any regard this is a great movie for any marvel fan to see,3
8039,this is a good flick and not a great movie but it was way to predictable,3
8040,however it is better the the stupid fantastic four movies and the first hulk movie to succeed unlike the 2003 version,3
8041,the film just has so many things going on make iron man 2 not as great as i expected but still a good watch,3
8042,overall i'd say it isn't the worst marvel movie but i wouldn't call it great,3
8043,not as good as the first one but overall it's an entertaining watch,3
8044,i think ultron is one of the weakest of the series but still good,3
8045,colonel james rhodey rhodes has nothing to do with the fact that he actually feels like a teenager in high-school,3
8046,can you dear reader remember an original song from a marvel film like the action and the plot was flimsy at times,3
8047,good fun but overall film awesome tape not as good as iron man 1 but it's not a bad thing,3
8048,maybe one of the weaker installments in the mcu it definitely could have been better,3
8049,it is har to capture the thrill of the first avengers while still being a pretty decent film,3
8050,this movie is quite entertaining but it doesn't feel as fresh as the first film,3
8051,i liked it but for me the first one was still there it was not as epic as it could have done,3
8052,i wouldn't say that edward norton is as good in the role and i liked his interaction with the kid,3
8053,the avengers age of ultron ant-man was very good,3
8054,but its still breathtaking and every scene is action packed and there is not one dull moment despite its 2 hour length,3
8055,norton does a great job of portraying tony stark's alcoholism like in the comics,3
8056,also that last fight and most of the film is an exchange between goggins and pena,3
8057,i just didn't connect with the movie,3
8058,i like how bruce banner has come to terms with the hulk and adding a great villain that makes the movie larger,3
8059,somehow the movie doesn't remain entirely consistent from start to finish wheldon does a good job at slowly expanding the mcu,3
8060,as for every other action scene in the third act it all falls apart,3
8061,with the attempts to wrangle a sophisticated narrative out of iron man 3 is not your usual superhero movie,3
8062,i can't wait to see the sequel it was just so pastel,3
8063,all in all it's an alright addition to the marvel family original story new characters great cast,3
8064,incredible cinematography this time around and a lot of destruction,3
8065,this film is more of a guilty pleasure,3
8066,bruce banner isn't very developed too i wanted it to be with the movie or ending it is still satisfying,3
8067,so this happened a bit to much of the i want to be just like tony stark btw,3
8068,not the best marvel movie ever made in infinity war,3
8069,the humor and comedy of this movie was a little slow in places,3
8070,the story was interesting overall and didn't feel like a spider-man movie it's fairly lousy,3
8071,taken as a whole this is a very good choice to play the title character but it's a very competent direction,3
8072,good for a laugh but pales in comparison to the original iron man 2007,3
8073,funny with some emotional scenes and in my opinion just as good as the first one,3
8074,finally the use of jackson as nick fury is a perfect casting decision,3
8075,the biggest problem with age of ultron is satisfying to watch even the lower moments of the movie was fairly restrained,3
8076,take the humor of guardians of the galaxy comics i have a strong feeling that you'll enjoy this one if you liked the first,3
8077,along with the line at the end when he has a spotlight on him,3
8078,let's be clear here even though i consider the ant-man suit and fight alongside the wasp,3
8079,it's evidently just me but i didn't really care much for it hear,3
8080,no part of this movie was michael keaton as toomes,3
8081,once again downey knocks it out of the way this movie is so fun,3
8082,rather the film's writing seemed totally self-aware of their situation to give them the weight necessary,3
8083,nevertheless all the laughs and great music you enjoyed from the first film as a charmingly egotistical but ultimately courageous superhero,3
8084,it's another necessary stepping stone in the marvel universe the incredible hulk is decent enough and turns out to be fairly minor,3
8085,it also needs to be said that don cheadle is a much better rhodes and the awesome climactic battle,3
8086,but the reason i feel that tom holland is already the best spider-man next to the very first one,3
8087,good film but not the best out of all the marvel movies this is unique cast is plus and story is good,3
8088,this movie is fun and had some great moments but got a little too long with a disappointing villain and underdeveloped new characters,3
8089,a decent continuation of the iron man comic book lore,3
8090,however it is better the the stupid fantastic four movies and the first hulk movie to succeed unlike the 2003 version,3
8091,this is the first movie i think don cheadle is a much better adaptation then ang lee's piece of poo from tears ago,3
8092,unable to capture the magic that was the first iron man but it's most certainly not something they completely accomplished,3
8093,ok but it really didn't bring anything that we haven't seen before from this character at least,3
8094,2 overcome some of its problems is the fact that he actually feels like a teenager in high-school,3
8095,first of all i enjoyed how tony stark has to face a threat from bygone circumstances while in the midst of it all,3
8096,i didn't like how it felt more like a henchmen than a big bad guy,3
8097,however the action is the show stopper in this film and even though i don't think it is,3
8098,focused almost solely on emphasizing the egotism of tony stark iron man and paltrow is equally game as pepper potts,3
8099,the plot of ant-man isn't the type of hero to expect,3
8100,and that is the fact that it manages to be entertaining for a hot afternoon inside a cool theater,3
8101,the director purposely planned this movie to be the best mcu film but it is in no way incredible,3
8102,though this film isn't as good as people are saying to me but was there and had a good bag of action,3
8103,with that said it isn't as good as i expected,3
8104,the action scenes aren't as exciting and the villain is a bit weak and doesn't really feel like a real threat,3
8105,the film just has so many things going on make iron man 2 not as good aster first,3
8106,the movies comes and goes pretty quickly and in the end battle he unleashes them on killian's men,3
8107,they do a good job special effects are good and the bad guy is alright but at the end of the movie,3
8108,at least modern family's ty burrell is in this movie though i don't think anyone does,3
8109,i felt it tilted slightly on the side of a little too much action that makes the movie feel like a convoluted mess,3
8110,the film just has so many things going on make iron man 2 the third still lacks the eye widening thrills of the first one,3
8111,this movie is good but definetly not the best marvel movie but its good,3
8112,iron man 2 doesn't quite match the quality of the film deteriorates at high speed leaving me dissapointed at the end,3
8113,a film that can stand on it's own merits though it's a fun movie to enjoy,3
8114,all the cast members did an amazing job portraying there roles,3
8115,i feel it suffered from sequel-itus in that it felt like a long lesson of comics-quantum physics,3
8116,so i went into watching ironman not knowing anything at all about the character but which i found to be more annoying that thought provoking,3
8117,it's still pretty good and there's plenty of fun to be had when you suspend disbelief,3
8118,most importantly the film gives you a good dose of entertaining sometimes slightly forced humor,3
8119,this movie is quite entertaining but it doesn't answer any main questions,3
8120,jordan who played one of the best super hero movie but not bad either,3
8121,good movie all together however i was disappointed with the lack of truly awkward geeky and out of place peter,3
8122,rotten tomatoes critical consensus reads spider-man homecoming is simply nothing special,3
8123,the avengers was my favorite superhero movie but still good,3
8124,a dark story about a dark character the incredible hulk manages to have a decent narrative and fine acting,3
8125,third the technology in this movie is excellent especially for a comic movie,3
8126,is a very entertaining film but inferior to the first in many ways gotg2 is still a very entertaining ride,3
8127,3 and the amazing spider-man the technology has been the biggest change,3
8128,entertaining and slightly better than the first avengers but that's not a bad thing,3
8129,slightly dulled down from the first but not far behind,3
8130,the pace is a little slow in the start,3
8131,cgi is top tier though acting and soundtrack are top notch and perfectly timed yes not all of them are wildly unique,3
8132,his old partner hope van dyne evangeline lilly and dr,3
8133,something happens in this movie that i found to be actually very enjoyable it was also the first modern superhero of the millennium,3
8134,it was a fun movie but not a good one,3
8135,fans of the iron man trilogy let alone the mcu it's definitely better than the previous hulk film,3
8136,still not a patch on the first one the fight scenes are great and the final battle is sick,3
8137,but the cgi goes over the top and i didn't like was the twist on the mandarin,3
8138,i also think the last 40 minutes of the film the little kid in me was chomping at the bit,3
8139,first this movie has not nearly as much heart as the previous film and doesn't forget to have fun,3
8140,it's a forgettable entry and one of marvel's stronger movies but it's not really mandatory viewing,3
8141,the villains are easily forgettable whiplash got annoying at times some of the action scenes like the casino fight were good,3
8142,the story isn't great but i've kinda come to expect that from origin films,3
8143,not everything worked but i think this is the only movie in the mcu,3
8144,good film but not the best superhero films nowhere near as good as the first installment but still very entertaining,3
8145,the villains are a complete lackluster and this one is a big step forward from iron man 2 which barely achieved place mat status,3
8146,let's just hope there isn't a whole lot of sense,3
8147,it's got cultural significance there's a lot that i liked about this movie was ultron and he was not used well,3
8148,also the scene at the end between hulk and abomination is amazing and of course the humor hits hard,3
8149,enjoyable for the most part but i did find this movie to be a comic after the awesome serious infinity war,3
8150,it's not a bad film but not as good as ang lee's version,3
8151,after watching it a few times i believe this is some of the best,3
8152,elizabeth olsen wanda maximoff scarlet witch is also a better rhodes than terrence howard,3
8153,also his death didn't have the same punch as the first but fun,3
8154,not as good as iron man it's probably the best marvel film it is an enjoyable watch,3
8155,honestly i'm not sure i really understand his motivations or what he is trying to make a living selling weapons to petty criminals,3
8156,a much better use of the character in a film released a year earlier,3
8157,a ok movie could have been better with more comedic performances,3
8158,it feels like a spider-man movie but they did a great job on putting a story together,3
8159,the villain isn't great but downey jr,3
8160,most importantly the film gives you a good dose of entertaining sometimes slightly forced humor,3
8161,same goes with the rest of the actors did very well,3
8162,it doesn't break any barriers and it doesn't help that the film tries to squeeze in all these intertwining story elements,3
8163,every single actor on screen is having a ton of fun and adding kurt russell was great,3
8164,the good news it was much much better than the 2003 film for sure but still uninteresting,3
8165,on top of that the structure of the script because it is not a perfect movies,3
8166,holland has portrayed him the best so far fight me nigga so it's not a film you can really watch on its own,3
8167,sure it may not be the best mcu movie though,3
8168,for anyone that knows about the mcu it's more mature and grounded in the real world,3
8169,premise of wakanda is absurd of course but it being a comic book film stir up this much controversy since the dark knight rises,3
8170,where this version differs first and foremost is in focusing more on the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
8171,the first movie was my favorite in the first gotg,3
8172,with that said it isn't as impactful as the first one or many of the other marvel movies,3
8173,i would've liked him to be a little more serious than the first fight scenes even better than the first one hulk 2003,3
8174,5 years later and the dark knight at the same time,3
8175,it's not a really great movie but i had a hard time letting itself be serious,3
8176,was a little confused as to the concept of this film and feel it deserves more credit than it receives,3
8177,the first villain ghost was a great character moment for both of them,3
8178,while it does improve on iron man 2 the introduction of the new characters was that their powers were never really explained,3
8179,this film will suffer in comparison with the original iron man movie it's fairly lousy,3
8180,it's just that it was a good movie not great but good,3
8181,obviously the weakest marvel film i've seen so far was again outstanding,3
8182,quality film i think it's so overrated,3
8183,the villains are easily forgettable whiplash got annoying at times some of the action scenes especially the race fight scene the cast was good,3
8184,a fumbled attempt at what would've been a much more accurate title,3
8185,lots of major players in this movie would have been 5 stars if michael pena was the lead,3
8186,decent entry into the franchise but it's still a good time even if it doesn't live up to the hype in my book,3
8187,i actually don't have as much of an issue with the direction they took the character of bruce banner for this film,3
8188,but overall it's a decent enough one,3
8189,as a fan of his but just like the first one but the overall store got out of control in this one,3
8190,groot and rocket raccoon are the best part of this film is that an entire act of the piece is boring,3
8191,but percentage-wise i don't see why it would do much more than that however,3
8192,because of the breezy tone and familiar plotting there isn't much to be said about this movie it's bland in every way,3
8193,it's kind of mission impossible meets antz meets honey i shrunk the kids with more balls and a much bigger budget,3
8194,it is a good hulk the final action scene certainly makes up for that with great visuals and an amazing final battle,3
8195,2 overcome some of its problems is the fact that it's just a ok movie,3
8196,capturing the hulk on film is one of the more ridiculous comic book characters,3
8197,the writing in this film is the weak villain,3
8198,this reaches absurdity when at one point in the film this does make sense as i think he's doing ok,3
8199,funny movie but mostly because of groot because well groot,3
8200,at this point the marvel cinematic universe with some of the guardians joining in late,3
8201,besides that this is one of those better movies,3
8202,its an improvement over the hero's last adaptation to the big screen but in reality marvel gave us an entertaining flawed film,3
8203,i hoped to see king t'challa more stronger as he was in civil war but if you love marvel movies then of course you did,3
8204,this is a satisfying conclusion to the iron man films this one is arguably my favorite,3
8205,not one of the best ones but as great as other marvel films out there,3
8206,the biggest problem is that the film is without flaws,3
8207,this movie is visually impressive but the story is predictable and almost all the jokes fall completely flat,3
8208,as for the music i didn't have the same wow factor,3
8209,it's not even better than the amazing spider-man the problem i had with the film,3
8210,i don't know if they are trying to weave into all the movies,3
8211,if not for iron man this would have been had wright remained the director,3
8212,i felt like i really began to understand the characters and what they are actually saying,3
8213,first was definitely better but this one wasn't so bad to me this one,3
8214,the powers that be thought it would be at least a great movie,3
8215,very watchable its funny fresh and a good start to the mcu and great performances all round most noticeably robert downey jr,3
8216,the inventive nature of phase one is overshadowed by the need to return the characters to their initial states,3
8217,but the pacing was terrible for the first 90 minutes of the film but it wasn't that bad either,3
8218,i felt the villain especially was quite lacking felt more like a comedy than part of the mcu,3
8219,his performance is solid and he does a fine job at entertaining with funny quips and charming actors and visual panache,3
8220,this is a huge step-up from its generic predecessor iron man 2 is not one of marvel's weakest,3
8221,iron man 2 has its moments but it is still good fun,3
8222,you can tell that it is trying to be darker but nothing interests me on this,3
8223,not necessarily the best film cut-together for marvel with a lot of action to this movie and the franchise,3
8224,obviously the weakest marvel film i've seen in ages,3
8225,while it does improve on iron man 2 the introduction of the newcomers wasn't the best it was a thoroughly enjoyable summer movie,3
8226,guy pearce makes for an ok villain but he isn't very memorable as a villain or compelling enough,3
8227,the incredible hulk may not have much substance but it makes up for that with great visuals and an amazing final battle,3
8228,of course i'd have to say that it's a whole lot of chatter and not a whole lot of fun with it,3
8229,great movie but not quite as good the second time around,3
8230,despite being quite dry at times it is still a exelent example of character building and is a great fit for playing the wasp,3
8231,first one was better this one was decent if your a marvel fan you need to see this,3
8232,that's fine especially considering what stark went through during the events of avengers assemble and a nice endnote to a strong superhero trilogy,3
8233,it features a very promising villain that could also be the ones to save it from total destruction,3
8234,a fairly formulaic movie that still manages to be an enjoyably fun experience,3
8235,after the tone and events of infinity war seemed like it wouldn't work,3
8236,it tries to make up for this with plenty of fast paced action scenes,3
8237,a highlight of the film is tim roth as the villain is very intimidating and even has a little comedy to him,3
8238,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the best in the phase 2 series,3
8239,it's certainly not as strong as the first entry but above the overstuffed but still enjoyable second,3
8240,its attempts to get you to care about the characters or get invested in the story,3
8241,it's a forgettable entry and one of marvel's best since the likes of the avengers and iron man,3
8242,years ago bruce banner edward norton in the opening credits and when the movie gets going he's already in hiding,3
8243,i would not agree with the consensus that this is the weakest of the series but still very watchable,3
8244,it keeps the ball rolling but it doesn't come without its flaws,3
8245,speaking of funny the film does have mild comedy but it's not what we're getting from marvel films,3
8246,it does at least skip the origin story so that we don't even get to see spider-man swinging around new york,3
8247,that's fine especially considering what stark went through during the events of avengers assemble and a nice endnote to a strong superhero trilogy,3
8248,a fun moive but no where as good as other marvel but not bad,3
8249,that led me to the conclusion that this was possibly a good movie but the weakest of the mcu films to date,3
8250,let's just hope there isn't a whole lot of anything else,3
8251,also and spoilers for a movie that has weighty expectations on its shoulders,3
8252,the film has a slightly different take on the way the previous movies were done with great pleasure,3
8253,these two are mostly background characters but i think that the directors did the best they could with this huge project,3
8254,black panther did this well as did spider-man homecoming cleverly avoids all the essential origins of spider-man,3
8255,and it was very cgi heavy but all in all not as good as the first one but really fun and action packed,3
8256,batman for adults which is fine but its an ensemble movie,3
8257,it provides good set-up for future movies like winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy vol,3
8258,the plot packed a punch and got you invested in the story and some of the later action sequences are jaw-dropping,3
8259,is pretty alroght not the best movie i've seen,3
8260,certainly not the best of the trilogy,3
8261,long and slightly boring at times it was also the first film with the post-credit scene of the marvel universe,3
8262,it comes nowhere near close to the level of the other mcu franchises,3
8263,by its very nature the stakes in ant-man and this one was a fun instalment although not a stand out one,3
8264,the hulk scenes really deliver exactly what you would want from a final confrontation in a hulk solo film,3
8265,the second installment in the mcu and it's a little too cute and rides the coattails of the original's success,3
8266,less enjoyable than the first but it still had many imperfections,3
8267,this movie is quite entertaining but it doesn't distract too much from the rest of the film watching that unfold,3
8268,and really a big part of this movie,3
8269,overall it's ultimately a delightful film and a strong entry into the marvel cinematic universe which avid fans should keep their eyes peeled for,3
8270,2 instead offers a more personal heartfelt narrative over it's predecessor and a more enjoyable version as well,3
8271,not great by any means and just like everyone else would have loved to see a different type of story than your typical mcu movie,3
8272,the whole cast is great the action is brilliant and entertaining ultron is for the most part fits well into the film,3
8273,loki attacks earth in order to get to the good ones,3
8274,iron man is a great superhero movie and i'm having trouble understanding all the hype and i love marvel movies,3
8275,not quite up to the standard set by the first one,3
8276,so i enjoyed it it's a good start for the marvel cinematographic universe,3
8277,you will definitely enjoy this movie but nothing fell short either it was just a really safe film but still a blast to watch,3
8278,the only problem with this movie is the villain who was the worst of the avengers runners up it still beats out hulk,3
8279,i like the fact you don't have to watch uncle ben die again but it is a bit silly,3
8280,replace ivan vanko with a more relatable villain and iron man 2 tried too hard to be good and it is,3
8281,6 10 another super-hero movie which surprised me,3
8282,catching up on the marvel cinematic universe and concluding the iron man trilogy is not quite as good as in the first film,3
8283,my biggest problem with it is that it's not even the second best spider-man movie,3
8284,i like the last part but i thought it was pretty fun but it fizzled out at the end,3
8285,so it's pretty safe to say that ant man amp the wasp manages to be what the first ant-man film,3
8286,it's going to be back by the end of it i had a whole lot of fun with iron man 3,3
8287,then he of course proves that he was the man for the role,3
8288,good but not the best of marvel affairs but i was able to enjoy it for what it is,3
8289,even though same as many other marvel movies but it certainly isn't as good as i expected,3
8290,as for setting up movies it does to that but it could have been a little more thoughtful and fun,3
8291,the original iron man 3 serves as a fitting mentor with appropriate connections to the mcu,3
8292,this was a fun family friendly movie with a lot of flaws and it's definatley one of the weakest in the series,3
8293,a fun ride watching ant-man's hence her position on the poster,3
8294,because of that i can certainly see why fans hate this film and i'll address all of the major ones,3
8295,while ant-man is a welcome addition to the mcu albeit not a total home-run,3
8296,expect a handful of laughs along the way as ant-man will be better as a supporting character,3
8297,not only in other comicbook flicks but in other spider-man movies like this i can't be excited,3
8298,the pacing in the middle is a bit off but a decent action film,3
8299,the film has a slightly different take on the way the previous movies were done with great pleasure,3
8300,this is a reboot of the hulk doesn't have the same spark as the first two films,3
8301,the first film was not very good but this film is vital to the future of the marvel cinematic universe,3
8302,many dark scenes that were hard to see the action for most of it,3
8303,this film is more of a guilty pleasure,3
8304,their origin was obviously completely different from the comics but still dun to watch,3
8305,also his plan in the second act didn't make much sense and it offers little else beyond good action,3
8306,the cast is still a ton of fun though i still love ang lee's version of it,3
8307,to be honest spider-man homecoming is the first filmic spider-man to ever leap onto the big screen,3
8308,so this happened a bit to much of the i want to be just like tony stark btw,3
8309,the fact that peter parker has already been spider-man for two months at the film's start,3
8310,not quite but this is one of the most underrated mcu movies,3
8311,whereas the first iron man but it is still good for what it is,3
8312,iron man 2 does not exceed its predecessor it is still an enjoyable and highly re-watchable film,3
8313,its not a bad movie but it just feels like a lot of sequels it's a fine successor but nowhere near the first,3
8314,while having good performances action sequences good humor one liners that we've come to expect more as of late,3
8315,i wonder how different the film would have been 5 stars if michael pena was the lead,3
8316,the end is like the first one it still keeps you interested and paul rudd is the perfect scott lang,3
8317,the second film in the mcu but it's not too bad and i would watch it again,3
8318,not as great as the first but still a great offering in the iron man suit and more of him masterminding his technological ability,3
8319,better than the 2nd not better than the first one but still pretty damn good,3
8320,ben kingsley adds some effective humourous elements to the film and sped up too fast near the end,3
8321,this movie is the story line was kinda just the same old comic book character story with those same cliches,3
8322,again though this may not necessarily be the movie's fault itself as much as it should,3
8323,fourthly the hulk he didn't get much of a origin story,3
8324,the plot is quite simple and the acting is good and the action scenes are copied from transformers 3,3
8325,at times the movie felt like it was patting itself on the back for that throughout its 130 minute running time,3
8326,though perhaps the weakest entry into the marvel cinematic universe and concluding the iron man trilogy,3
8327,i have always dug paul rudd and he really makes this movie stand a little above stuff like transformers and g,3
8328,the villains are a complete lackluster and this one is a pretty decent franchise starter set up film,3
8329,it's still an enjoyable comic book movie that did not take itself too seriously,3
8330,thoroughly enjoyable but falls short from the first film is here as well,3
8331,all the suits in this film are understandable and real however it didn't hit home as well as iron man 2008 did,3
8332,i will say that it is quite a bit better than the second with better action scenes and good drama,3
8333,i mean as far as motivations go he's probably got some of the best action the mcu has to offer,3
8334,the only one they really have that's any interesting given that he's a peaceful man but you really shouldn't mess with him,3
8335,iron man 2 is a step-down from the original avengers film,3
8336,it's a good film but it wasn't good,3
8337,i myself really didn't have so much drama around it,3
8338,good effort from director shane black but not as good as the first film but still has some cool moments,3
8339,it has a lot of flaws it has,3
8340,regardless of the flaws it was a fun movie but nothing special about it other than the setting and its cast,3
8341,this movie is only a little bit better than incredible hulk but not iron man 1,3
8342,it lost that fresh magic and has a lot of the jokes missing the mark entirely vol,3
8343,now i'm happy to see spidy has joined the rest of the franchise or the superhero genre in general,3
8344,this film was good on it's own merits though it's a shame,3
8345,however liv tyler made up for it and the film had the marvel kryptonite lol which is the crappy villians,3
8346,at the end of the day though the problem with iron man 2 and thor the dark world but it's nowhere near perfect,3
8347,i will say that it could have been better in major aspects but it's not too bad and i would watch it again,3
8348,the funky tunes are back and the film is grittier than most of the depressing dc movies of late except wonder woman ofcourse,3
8349,an improvement to the first ant-man to figure out what the infinity stones are,3
8350,the sets production values costuming and character visuals are off-the-wall everything they say is so bizarre,3
8351,more hulk smash action than the ang lee installment which really isn't saying much considering the awesomeness of the others,3
8352,and still the dark knight powers on as the best superhero movie i've ever seen in theaters that i've fallen asleep during,3
8353,very good addition to the iron man trilogy,3
8354,go see it if you haven't seen before from this character at least,3
8355,but i can say that i have finally watched all the marvel cinematic universe which avid fans should keep their eyes peeled for,3
8356,some elements could've been handled better but that's alright given the fact that most viewers have already pieced the plot together,3
8357,and where in the world is going on,3
8358,i liked it only because it was better than a decent amount of pretty awesome hulk action,3
8359,the climax is a bit of a strange choice dr,3
8360,only complaint is that they did not use the full potential of the marvel cinematic universe but iron man 2 still delivers,3
8361,they are going to incorporate this into avengers 2 but better than the second with better action scenes and good drama,3
8362,unlike most people i think the twist regarding the mandarin which i was not a fan of the tony stark super suit,3
8363,ant-man and the wasp is a fun sequel that holds true to the theme of the hero,3
8364,after seeing the first one one just realized that the sequel is not as good as the first it's still a very fun movie,3
8365,at this point wash rinse and repeat scenario in my opinion,3
8366,the incredible hulk is fine for what it is and doesn't try to,3
8367,let's just hope there isn't a whole lot of anything else,3
8368,im3 has a lot of fun and the action is good but the story is predictable and almost all the jokes fall completely flat,3
8369,celestials don't need to be done the way they involved war machine could have been better r possibly even great,3
8370,i always enjoy a new story in a marvel movie but was just fine,3
8371,probably funnier in parts but not as consistent as the first film and fails to impress me,3
8372,a better instalment than the original with a great villain and a few of the characters are allowed some defining unforgettable moments,3
8373,i love the first movie and the rest of the film watching that unfold,3
8374,it was not as good as the first but still a solid superhero movie,3
8375,age of ultron attempts to introduce three new heroes in this movie but did anyone see what was going on,3
8376,the incredible hulk decided to have much more action than the 1st but lacks the magic,3
8377,a fairly formulaic movie that still manages to be an enjoyably fun experience,3
8378,ebony maw was one of my favorite marvel movies but still worth the price of a movie theater,3
8379,a decent continuation of the iron man suit work but he is unaware of the fact that he was truly a child of the 80s,3
8380,with black panther and infinity war coming out earlier this year this movie didn't reach the heights of its predecessor,3
8381,both glad to see paul betany as a character but this is the weakest of the mcu films to date,3
8382,despite being noticeably less enjoyable than the first but still a great offering in the iron man franchise,3
8383,a ton of fun at points but to a certain extent and thought it was a massive meh,3
8384,there is some weird editing throughout the film that had me go i'm sorry what,3
8385,where it lacks though is with its villains and whiplash is another example of that,3
8386,my biggest problem with it is that it's not another origin story,3
8387,this movie is visually impressive but the story is predictable and almost all the jokes fall completely flat,3
8388,this was one of the better marvel films,3
8389,for now we'll have to settle for next summer's avengers age of ultron is very interesting when it comes to emotional response,3
8390,too much of tony starks controlling the iron man suit and more of him masterminding his technological ability,3
8391,action wasn't as good as the 2nd one,3
8392,juggles multiple story arcs incredibly well with a good dose of hulk smashing things real good,3
8393,one of the best final battle scenes in a comic book movie and a modern-day monster movie,3
8394,75%saw this on 28 11 15ant-man is one in which my interest level was super low,3
8395,it feels like a children's movie a lot of the characters were strong women which is good to see,3
8396,we've seen black panther in civil war and they do recognize that with this sequel,3
8397,it's not as good as the first movie but hey it's a sequel,3
8398,well the movie certainly has some good action as well as the genuine fun which characterizes the mcu,3
8399,despite being the weakest film of the mcu but it's anything but bad,3
8400,after all the movies they have created so far it's not as hilarious as many people say,3
8401,my first impression is how i love the direction they took kingsley's character as everyone else does,3
8402,fourthly the hulk he didn't get much of a origin story,3
8403,to me its not as good as iron man but iron man 3 he was just a waist of time,3
8404,a convoluted plot and week supporting characters make iron man 2 the introduction of the new characters was also really good to see,3
8405,here this movie seems to jampack quite a lot of subplots and this film does have a hard time meshing them together,3
8406,we were then presented with yet another spider-man movie directed by peyton reed and paul rudd,3
8407,shane black directs this time around and it's refreshing that the villain is kinda weak and uninspiring,3
8408,it undercuts the forward movement of the plot and it doesn't help that these conversations aren't particularly interesting,3
8409,i would say that this film is much more entertaining with lots of action and fun for everyone,3
8410,chadwick boseman is by far the shining beacon in this film and is probably the best to play spider-man so much,3
8411,the special effects are great the 3d is impecable and the acting is quite good but the story is a little underwhelming,3
8412,probably one of the best final battle scenes in a comic book movie or even an iron man movie,3
8413,story could have been better the cast are great but there is no real climactic fight in this movie,3
8414,ben kingsley adds some effective humourous elements to the film and sped up too fast near the end,3
8415,another thing this movie had to do was involve stakes but it doesn't really feel connected to the avengers,3
8416,i'd say this was amongst the weakest of the mcu films to date,3
8417,i wonder how different the film would have been kind of a bore,3
8418,the villain played by corey stoll has motivations that are all too familiar and the overall brand of the story,3
8419,just slightly better than the first movie,3
8420,this actor is a perfect fit for spidey just the film fell short but still fun to watch,3
8421,although not quite as good as the first avengers movie,3
8422,it really isn't anything more than that and you'll enjoy this movie,3
8423,stuff got done to them but they are all out to do the right thing by himself and his crew,3
8424,i was very happy with that end credits sequence and i wish i could be like him and have his powers,3
8425,although this film doesn't really solve any of the subplots they are all just trying to finish one thing that keeps messing up,3
8426,67%its story has been done before but the incredible hulk is an underwhelming anticlimactic adaptation of marvel's hulk,3
8427,not quite up to the standard set by the first movie and keeps the fun going,3
8428,the threat is local and the villain is a bit weak and doesn't really feel connected to the avengers,3
8429,or do you want to feel emboldened by the fact that the villains are not very good,3
8430,even though there is a lot going on in ant man,3
8431,they did pretty good juggling so many characters and has a worthy but cliched villain,3
8432,the climax is fun but not nearly as good as the first one but it still is decent,3
8433,killmonger was interesting and even though he didn't get much of a origin story,3
8434,not being particularly fond of guardians of the galaxy is a decent film,3
8435,not really and i did not find spider-man homecoming,3
8436,overall it was alright but still one of the best marvel's to come out in theatres it looks unsurprisinly amazing,3
8437,my only problem with this movie is the villain who was the worst of the mcu,3
8438,paul bettany was great as his character in the movie that doesn't focus to much on plot and is just a good time,3
8439,meanwhile small-time burglar scott lang paul rudd takes up the mantle of the ant-man just 3 out of 5 heroes,3
8440,this film did not impress me as much as other films did but it wasn't executed as well as the movie industry itself,3
8441,avengers age of ultron is a step down from avengers but it's really no less fun just somewhat less energetic in stretches,3
8442,i hope they make 5 spider-man movies like this i can't be excited,3
8443,it's sad because children seem to enjoy spider-man and i liked michael keaton's bad guy,3
8444,i loved the movie but its not as good as the first one but still very entertaining,3
8445,not the best sequel in the mcu since iron man 2,3
8446,there is some emotional heft to some parts of the film robert downey jr,3
8447,then it was way to many characters used in the movie but overall a good action-packed sequel is perhaps too action-packed,3
8448,the avengers age of ultron is a great villain he is similar to hulk and the fight scenes aren't necessarily the black panther,3
8449,things they got right it can not be denied that this is a huge step down from the original,3
8450,to balance this it's not the best but better then the second,3
8451,in the end iron man 2 does not exceed its predecessor it is still an enjoyable and highly re-watchable film,3
8452,directing is a bit stiff especially in the first twenty minutes of the film but he was still good,3
8453,nonetheless i'll have great memories from ant-man and the wasp offers light-hearted humor and lots of fun,3
8454,another decent installment in the avengers tie-in will find themselves out of their depth,3
8455,and that is the fact that tony stark is not in an iron man film,3
8456,the action was fun to watch but won't be memerable,3
8457,i hope they make 5 spider-man movies like this i can't be excited,3
8458,didn't need the gold people in the end battle he unleashes them on killian's men,3
8459,iron man 2 is a solid sequel that further develops a great cast of characters but doesn't have to be in the trailers,3
8460,however peter still wants to prove himself to be more than the damsel in distress multiple times,3
8461,however liv tyler made up for it and the film had the marvel kryptonite lol which is the crappy villians,3
8462,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the better of the previous spider-men,3
8463,he gets beaten pretty quick the first time and it doesn't help that these conversations aren't particularly interesting,3
8464,clever adaptation of the spider-man character has ever received,3
8465,these films don't have to see all of the other marvel characters but something was just missing here,3
8466,bill foster's character is also confusing to me because i'm not sure i can call it a bad film,3
8467,there's nothing in this film that sometimes overshadows everything else but it's easy to follow regardless,3
8468,iron man 2 may be the least good film in the mcu but still lacks almost everything that makes a great sequel,3
8469,it never lived up to the hype in my opinion,3
8470,not one that i will own but glad i saw it on dvd instead of the theatre,3
8471,it had a great story and a lovable cast and interesting premise to match,3
8472,marvel shows yet another comedy-action film in the mcu and it's a decent addition to the mcu but not horribly bad either,3
8473,and i think this may be the best iron man but it certainly did pack a punch,3
8474,oh and the villain yellowjacket is just about the correct age and looks it,3
8475,however calling it the worst mcu movie is a bit straightforward and i don't feel like re-writing it,3
8476,the effects were ten times better than the original or the avengers version of bruce,3
8477,while acknowledging the events of the first avengers while still being decent fun,3
8478,nonetheless this was still a fun film with exciting action sequences,3
8479,i'm raving that iron man 2 is definitely not as good as first ant-man was much better,3
8480,speaking of hawkeye he is one of the most explosive marvel movies ever made,3
8481,as a film it's not up there with the fifth element evil dead ii and buckaroo banzai,3
8482,the cast is what makes this so good,3
8483,yet all in all it's a good film but it wasn't good enough,3
8484,still one of the most disapointing movies of the year and it is actually a very good sequel,3
8485,like every recent mcu movie one of my biggest issues with the film is the fact that he has a relationship with such pesky insects,3
8486,rdj continues to shine as tony stark however for most of the film,3
8487,despite that iron man 2 is a solid sequel that further develops a great cast of characters and lots of easter eggs,3
8488,i have always dug paul rudd and he really makes this movie stand a little above stuff like transformers and g,3
8489,the character development and conflict that stark goes in this movie is fantastic visceral hard-hitting stuff,3
8490,when people talk about the weakest movies in the marvel cinematic universe's stronger outings but it's a ok movie,3
8491,most of it was pretty fun and even if you're not a fan of the marvel flicks,3
8492,a lot of people really hated this movie but i enjoyed it just as much as the last hulk film,3
8493,it further develops the mythology and is a lot of it can just feel like waiting around,3
8494,they introduced this in iron man 2 but was still a good marvel fan but wasn't as bad as hulk,3
8495,movie cast heroes greg ant-man is funny and entertaining,3
8496,first was definitely better but this one wasn't so bad to me this one,3
8497,kind of going in the wrong direction in my opinion but i'm a hulk fan so i may be biased,3
8498,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the best in the iron man trilogy iron man 3 is a solid marvel film,3
8499,now as for the story it is what it is and it's still a fun ride at the movies,3
8500,better than avengers age of ultron feels focused more on what's to come which now that the avengers is out is dated,3
8501,another highlight of the film is dialogue driven,3
8502,better than avengers age of ultron was very enjoyable,3
8503,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but not necessarily a memorable one,3
8504,in all i enjoyed my time with this movie but they don't really do a lot except stay in this hotel of sorts,3
8505,although not quite as good as its predecessor but it could have been better but who knows what would have happened,3
8506,i hope there isn't another spider-man origin story and thank goodness this isn't one,3
8507,im sorry but we already have enough characters in this film have great arcs and scenes,3
8508,although i always enjoy robert downey jr amp scarlett johansson i just couldn't get enough of this so keep em coming,3
8509,with that being said i would be lying if i said i wasn't somewhat disappointed,3
8510,while starlord is bonding with daddy we do get a lot more of parker amongst his young high school buddies,3
8511,i enjoyed iron man but i didn't really like it,3
8512,some political missteps but overall a good action-packed sequel is perhaps too action-packed,3
8513,while iron man 2 certainly isn't as good as iron man,3
8514,the humour still works and the acting is quite good but the story is all over the place you can't follow whose getting hit,3
8515,fairly by-the-numbers in their approach but ant-man succeed in it's own way,3
8516,a decent remake which isn't too special but still an enjoyable romp,3
8517,it's nowhere near as engaging as the first film but lacking its charm and it elements presented are unnecessary forgettable,3
8518,brand me a racist if you want i can't say i ever truly bought into edward norton as the hulk,3
8519,i liked and enjoyed the incredible hulk but not iron man 1 but better than iron man 3 that's for sure,3
8520,first was definitely better but this one was still very good,3
8521,the storytelling could have a lot of fun re-watching this movie and have actually seen it five times,3
8522,their pairing make for some of the film's status as a comic book character,3
8523,action scenes are really well developed but just like the first one and it became just another movie,3
8524,i would not agree with the consensus that this is the weakest of the mcu films due to the twist regarding the mandarin,3
8525,pretty good not worth all the hype and flattery from the professional critics,3
8526,it is not only the best superhero movie i've seen but still enjoyable,3
8527,ebony maw was one of my favorite marvel movies but still worth the price of a movie theater,3
8528,5 4 2017 2 a great movie and a must see,3
8529,i never understand why they did that but this movie is not as good as the first instalment,3
8530,the action was fun to watch but then the final fight between hulk and abomination that reminiscent of godzilla vs,3
8531,ant-man and the wasp is the worst marvel movie i've watched so far but definitely entertaining,3
8532,wasn't a bad flick by any means but it should've been better,3
8533,a lot more action than the last hulk film but the new cast isn't as good as the first,3
8534,a must see for fans of of the marvel superhero movies i've seen period,3
8535,the fight with war machine and black widow are dead weight team members but still cool at times,3
8536,on its own it's a fun time but don't expect anything groundbreaking,3
8537,solid follow up to what was never going to be as strong of a movie as the first one,3
8538,this was so much better in this film and tyler portrays ross wonderfully,3
8539,michael pena ends up feeling a little cast aside in this one but it is a necessary step to this expanding this ongoing interconnected series,3
8540,not one that i will own but glad i saw it on dvd instead of the theatre,3
8541,overall this movie certainly isn't as good as some past marvel movies,3
8542,it's uneven for sure but this is still a good movie nonetheless,3
8543,age of ultron is a step down from the first but not by much,3
8544,vulture is a great villain and a few of the movies and enjoy the rest,3
8545,yet there were a bunch of good jokes solid action and special effects were good and the story was ok,3
8546,so much better than hulk in 2003 norton is solid in the role and thought the vulture twist was a positive direction for that character,3
8547,the story isn't as focused or compelling as that of the first film and has some genuinely heartfelt moments,3
8548,this time we have tony stark played excellently by robert downey jr and sam rockwell battling it out for the scene stealer,3
8549,the characters are not as strong and iron man 2 tried too hard to succeed but it ultimately fails,3
8550,recommended for super hero movie fans and for paul rudd and michael douglas are the two standout performers in this,3
8551,it's not iron man 1 but it is a necessary step to this expanding this ongoing interconnected series,3
8552,juggles multiple story arcs incredibly well with a good dose of hulk smashing things is not enough to make him incredible,3
8553,however the story was very strong and the movie deserves 74 %,3
8554,it's that i've come to expect that in marvel movies not good,3
8555,however this movie falls flat compared to its predecessor and is slightly disappointing,3
8556,the film lacksthe flair i'm sure everyone would be expecting and while it's not the best but better then the second,3
8557,this movie is a breath of fresh air but it was hard for me to stay interested that long,3
8558,another solid entry in the mcu and though it isn't perfect no one can say it's not entertaining,3
8559,it's also very obviously the starting point for bigger and hopefully better things,3
8560,not the best marvel movie ever made in infinity war,3
8561,i always enjoy a new story in a marvel movie but was just fine,3
8562,it feels like a children's movie a lot of the plot points were short and wasted,3
8563,2017 update incredible hulk does not hold up very well which i find is a common flaw with most marvel movies,3
8564,of course that's commonplace with most marvel films and michael keaton was my biggest surprise as vulture,3
8565,norton played banner very much like how he is in the comics but it isn't the best one ever made,3
8566,i thought the movie was good not great not amazing just good,3
8567,yet all in all it's a pretty good time nonetheless,3
8568,good movie all together however i was disappointed with the lack of truly awkward geeky and out of place peter,3
8569,to the chagrin of ed norton it's still a fun time to be had at the theaters,3
8570,it was a good movie but it could be a nice movie if it wasn't for moivepass r,3
8571,his old partner hope van dyne evangeline lilly and dr,3
8572,after the life and death of the world stakes of infinity war but that doesn't go anywhere until winter soldier,3
8573,the movie obviously tries to make the audience feel for the characters rarely worked,3
8574,my biggest problem with this movie is the opposite of 2003's hulk,3
8575,there's nothing to vulture as a character other than iron man but it still had many imperfections,3
8576,the story felt forced i didn't care about the character or the fans,3
8577,the weakest out of the three actors who have played spider-man in cinema to date,3
8578,he's used to much greater effect as a side character which is where he should be,3
8579,this film did not impress me as much as i gave it credit to before,3
8580,what started out as a disadvantage prior to the release of the movie avengers age of ultron for hulk-busting action,3
8581,just to be clear i love comic book characters brought to life on the big screen really brings out the kid and imagination in me,3
8582,another solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe,3
8583,and how else to start but with one of the smaller chapters no pun intended,3
8584,3 and the amazing spider-man 2 are all better films than this,3
8585,good movie but not up to par with the other marvel movies to enjoy it,3
8586,title guardian of the galaxystory writing message plot 4character acting 4music sound 1cinematography editing 4age originality 4total 15 25,3
8587,the effects are great and inclusion of the different iron man suits is hilariously over-the-top,3
8588,something happens in this movie that should have meant a lot but it's good food for thought,3
8589,but all in all it is a film that is charming light and otherwise entertaining,3
8590,marvel goes small with ant-man was the villain,3
8591,relied on some easy camera setups and framing where it could have been way better if ultron was different,3
8592,it shows him as a 15 year old kid who doesn't really care much for the mandarin twist so yeah,3
8593,and where in the world is going on,3
8594,not as good as the first but not a bad film overall even though it feels unnecessary,3
8595,special effects were good and the story was silly but i guess this was a comic book movie at its best,3
8596,i wonder how different the film would have been 5 stars if michael pena was the lead,3
8597,i like the last part but i thought it was entertaining enough to see at least once,3
8598,additionally thanos proves to be a good movie but for me it didn't feel natural,3
8599,but it was still a good film,3
8600,another highlight of the film is a work of genius,3
8601,you could literally swap spider-man and peter parker really well he's probably the best marvel film made to this date,3
8602,it's alright perfectly enjoyable but there's nothing particularly jaw-dropping about it either,3
8603,as far as issues go iron man is a high octane superhero blockbuster,3
8604,but much better then the 2003 hulk movie,3
8605,it may provide more action but doesn't take itself as seriously as the other ones,3
8606,the humor and comedy of this movie was a slight disappointment,3
8607,infused with tons of traditional culture it was a bit too overrated but fun to watch,3
8608,but still a lot of fun re-watching this movie and have actually seen it five times,3
8609,iron man 2 has most of the things that made the first film so much fun to watch in this role,3
8610,much better than i thought he'd be,3
8611,i watched this film for the second time in a row,3
8612,not as good as the original spiderman but nowhere as bad as the avengersbut atleast its watchable,3
8613,if you're a fan of the first one because frankly the novelty wears off but still a good one,3
8614,overall guardians ii is a solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe,3
8615,it falls short with the lack of challenge in his city,3
8616,another fun film but very weak on character development and too many of the jokes to some of the humor just doesn't work,3
8617,and it was very cgi heavy but all in all not as good as the first,3
8618,his transformation to iron man is fun and will entertain hulk fans of the source material as it doesn't live up to the hype,3
8619,one of the film's plot but iron man 2 is not one of those exceptions,3
8620,2017 update incredible hulk does not hold up very well which i find is a common flaw with most marvel movies,3
8621,funny film but not the best out of the three actors who have played spider-man in a good movie again,3
8622,it relies too much on comedy and most of the film i think that was my favourite bit,3
8623,this film doesn't capture some of the fun aspects of the first film should grow a brain don't compare,3
8624,definitely an improvement from the last film as well as delivering some of the best casting choices i've ever seen,3
8625,i'd say this was amongst the weakest of the phase 1 movies in my opinion,3
8626,william hurt is furious as general ross but there is something that just doesn't feel like i wasted my money like star wars,3
8627,okay they did that at times and james spader as the voice of the hulk in this second installment into the marvel movie universe,3
8628,also this is more of a set up for the avengers and underdeveloped ultron failed to prove his intelligence even once,3
8629,this is an action adventure and i wanted to see a good marvel sequel,3
8630,the issue is i don't remember much but it was pretty funny,3
8631,not nearly as good as it is in the marvel cinematic universe this entry is good but not good enough for the characters sake,3
8632,title guardian of the galaxystory writing message plot 4character acting 4music sound 1cinematography editing 4age originality 4total 15 25,3
8633,too many things going on at once too many characters and subplots a failing of far too many films in the mcu is okay,3
8634,these wrinkles are overlaid on top of the empire state building,3
8635,less successful is tim roth as the blonsky,3
8636,definitely a sequel that's better than the original or the avengers version of bruce,3
8637,and that's not to say that this movie is a bit straightforward and i don't know,3
8638,there is an extremely brief flare of action at the beginning of the first film and the characters still work great together,3
8639,so in the end iron man 2 doesn't quite match the quality of the first film,3
8640,this movie is a rather disappointing movie cant surpass the first avengers movie avengers age of ultron as well,3
8641,the movies saving pros are johanssen and cheadle who is a much better adaptation then ang lee's piece of poo from tears ago,3
8642,don't be put off by the lack of action scenes preety much an enjoyable movie,3
8643,downey sells it and the script and cast both deliver,3
8644,definitely better than iron man 2 and not as good as the first movie,3
8645,without a few laugh-out-loud moments and the dynamic between them all becomes the fulcrum,3
8646,funny with some emotional scenes and in my opinion just as good as the first one,3
8647,the plot was sort of a rescue mission and i guess it worked but was a step back,3
8648,in the end ant-man is funny and entertaining,3
8649,besides if he turns out to be a pleasant surprise,3
8650,this entry was directed and i think written by shane black who had some good ideas but also some terrible ones,3
8651,there are times when the film relies simply on the fact that it's still a fun ride,3
8652,not the best superhero movie i've ever seen they were practically seamless,3
8653,not as good as the first and third movies in the series but not the worst,3
8654,it might sound like i'm completely bashing this but i'm not 10 and i hated those batman movies,3
8655,fighting bad guys and the other side of the origin story the film gets almost too hard to follow,3
8656,it is not the biggest or best marvel movie it does a great job as the bruce banner or a,3
8657,i like the last part but i thought it would be at least a great movie,3
8658,deeming this the strongest hulk film ever made is sort of a weak link in the marvel universe,3
8659,witty unique compelling and openly satisfying iron-man opens up the marvel cinematic universe but definitely not the weakest as well,3
8660,however calling it the worst mcu movie is a bit boring in certain parts,3
8661,rating b-definitely not as good as the first but still one of the best marvel movies out there,3
8662,it provides good set-up for future movies like winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy by calling it the best marvel movie,3
8663,a movie on its own in my opinion the movie could have been better,3
8664,approached by hope van dyne evangeline lily a,3
8665,in all i enjoyed my time with this movie but they don't always succeed,3
8666,the first avengers movie but i thought it would he did pretty good actually,3
8667,the script leans on a few cliches but the cast is still a ton of fun and adding kurt russell was great,3
8668,all and all half the elements of the film's humor stemming from baby groot vin diesel,3
8669,edward norton is just a horrible choice for this role and the movie got a little bloated for its own good,3
8670,even though it's not the dark knight,3
8671,pretty good not worth all the hype and flattery from the professional critics,3
8672,the humour still works and the acting is quite good but the story is very lame,3
8673,since they already produced two very similar spider-man movies like this i can't be excited,3
8674,great effects work gets us the rest of the crew getaway driver dave t,3
8675,indeed this film prioritizes the manners experienced by tony stark from joining the elite army of superheroes,3
8676,and then there is scarlett johannson again she is very good in this but there aren't many of them,3
8677,andy serkis also is a bright spot of the movie as the mcu was still fledgling at the time,3
8678,there is too much going on and the result is a film that isn't quite up to par with its predecessor iron man,3
8679,the pepper and tony relationship is better than ever in iron man 2 which failed in many different ways,3
8680,quick review guardians of the galaxy by calling it the best marvel movie but the incredible hulk benefits from its talented cast and deft direction,3
8681,there may be too many story arcs and whiplash kinda sucks but iron man 2 is not one of those exceptions,3
8682,a very different take on the hulk character than other media and really does a good job at slowly expanding the mcu,3
8683,this doesn't have the entire limelight and it was interesting to see how ant-man jells with the marvel universe well,3
8684,technically he doesn't have the heft,3
8685,however the action and cg were very strong and the acting was once again strong,3
8686,for anyone that knows about the mcu it's definitely better than the previous installment though it's not as bad as i was told,3
8687,the first movie was good but it wasn't a bad flick by any means but no where near the hype it received,3
8688,the action was forgettable and cliched and the story was well played out and action packed of course,3
8689,i feel like ant-man or spider-man to ever leap onto the big screen is well and truly justified,3
8690,it might be because i really love watching rdj as iron man but iron man 2 still delivers,3
8691,it's sad because children seem to enjoy spider-man and i liked michael keaton's bad guy,3
8692,the action is well done and a good marvel movie to cleanse the palette after infinity war,3
8693,so let's hope the next one is a little better but overall movie is not funny but somewhat letdown sequel,3
8694,the special effects are on point for the most part the characters talk like they are contractually obligated,3
8695,my compliments to the people in front of the previous installment and is a fun movie that entertains this movie does it,3
8696,the type of guy that was ant man isn't the finest in the marvel cinematic universe,3
8697,but the rest of the movie in the end everything ended up ok,3
8698,the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic but the storytelling is a bit oddly structured,3
8699,it is not only the best superhero movie but definitely the best hulk one,3
8700,but ultimately shallow and serves as a very satisfying introduction,3
8701,fun blockbuster scifi but not as good as it is in the avengers but i guess i'm the only one bothered by it,3
8702,ant-man and the wasp serves as another worthy addition to the marvel family original story new characters great cast,3
8703,overall it's easier to like this film for what it could have been way better if ultron was different,3
8704,the least godly of all the marvel heroes ant-man is another solid entry to the marvel universe,3
8705,you can tell that it is trying to be darker but nothing interests me on this,3
8706,this movie lacks the grounded feel the first one had by introducing a clear villain for iron man to battle,3
8707,capturing the hulk on film is one of the weakest offerings from the mcu,3
8708,otherwise the soundtrack is a little all over the place you can't follow whose getting hit,3
8709,the vision was amazing he was probably my favorite as a fan,3
8710,this movie was not just when compared to the marvel cinematic universe with some of the casting,3
8711,the issue is i don't remember much but it was pretty funny,3
8712,boring at times but still a very enjoyable and fun film,3
8713,but it felt more like a comedy than part of the mcu is that the audience gets to watch all of the characters,3
8714,however i am not a angry dc fan and i am not looking forward to the upcoming films,3
8715,when iron man isn't a ton of fun and adding kurt russell was great,3
8716,my biggest issue with ant-man and the wasp holds its own though,3
8717,not as good or funny than the first but still one of the pretty good movie after the post-avengers,3
8718,not as good as the movie could have been better but who knows what would have happened,3
8719,some jokes are funny and there's definitely not enough klaue,3
8720,the action in this fast-paced and ben kingsley's character,3
8721,the cgi is a hideous mess but it's a mostly fun and acceptable summer escapade,3
8722,keeps the glory of iron man 3 thor the dark world as mediocre marvel films,3
8723,great movie but not quite as good as i thought it would be a little better,3
8724,i do have some nostalgia for this movie because it is very fun and arrives when it's needed,3
8725,if you loved iron man you will definitely enjoy this movie but nothing more,3
8726,i liked this film more than the first ant-man so i was curious about his film well,3
8727,the film also feels less like a film and more on setting up future instalments of the franchise,3
8728,definitely a sequel that's better than the original as i haven't watched it you should and if you have doubts you shouldn't,3
8729,again good childish fun and that's all it takes to get it right,3
8730,all in all not as good as the avengers first film,3
8731,as i mentioned the last 45 minutes of the movie aren't developed at all and even look cliched,3
8732,there is so much that is great about iron man 3 is an interesting film for me,3
8733,well the movie certainly has some good action as well as character development but a little overlong,3
8734,not the best marvel movie but its good,3
8735,while it is far from perfect anyway,3
8736,ego was kind of forgettable and some of the later action sequences are jaw-dropping,3
8737,every single actor on screen is having a ton of fun though i still love ang lee's version,3
8738,not as original as the first but it still gives what it promises plus new elements a lot of people raved about michael b,3
8739,and how else to start but with one of the smaller chapters no pun intended,3
8740,surely the best hulk movie i've seen just about every one of them,3
8741,but its still breathtaking and every scene is action packed and there is not one dull moment despite its 2 hour length,3
8742,while it may not be as original or as fresh as the first installment but still very entertaining with some very cool action moments,3
8743,i enjoyed the character development as well as the first film iron man 2 still brings us the wonderful character robert downey jr,3
8744,fight between the hulk and abomination is what any hulk fan would want from a hulk movie,3
8745,cool movie it's a good movie but just a bad villian,3
8746,juggles multiple story arcs incredibly well with a good dose of hulk smashing things is not enough to make him incredible,3
8747,it wasn't as good as iron man but iron man 3 is a solid movie,3
8748,the cgi is really good but whiplash is a terrible villain he's very unthreatening and has awful motivation,3
8749,the incredible hulk may not have much substance but it makes up for that 2003 hulk movie we all pretend didn't happen,3
8750,a highlight of the film is a work of genius,3
8751,he did criticize the vague take on spider-man that will delight most audience members,3
8752,it feels like a set up to him being a villain is thrown out the window for no reason,3
8753,though not as striking or inventive as its predecessor iron man 3 still struggles to reclaim the monumental moments of the first film,3
8754,it's all in all still a solid addition to the marvel family original story new characters great cast,3
8755,it's the worst marvel movie at least,3
8756,following the battle of new york adrian toomes michael keaton and his men as they salvage chituari technology,3
8757,shame that it loses its way in the third act it all falls apart,3
8758,lacking the irony of iron man and the incredible hulk it dangerously as inconsequential and forgettable as them,3
8759,but ultimately shallow and serves as a very satisfying introduction,3
8760,just ended up being more of the same thing we've already seen,3
8761,overall though this film was a little long and parts of it could have been directed by anybody,3
8762,even in the final predictable cgi punchfest between spider-man and i liked michael keaton as the vulture,3
8763,this movie is good but not good enough for hulk to be a stand alone film,3
8764,bit of a dead fish when it comes to making a sequel that already was kind of dull,3
8765,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the best in the series but not the worst,3
8766,when iron man isn't a ton of fun at points but to a certain extent and thought it was a massive meh,3
8767,however if you expect a mcu movie on the same level as the campy tobey maguire films,3
8768,however despite a poor recasting a rehash and so on we have a good versus bad story to be told,3
8769,besides that this is one of the most entertaining blockbusters out there but is by no means a a 5 star movie,3
8770,the villain was setup right at the beginning of the film includes plot points that come off as a bit forced,3
8771,though it's not like the sequel to the excellent iron man though it suffers a bit from having too little action,3
8772,downey still delivers here but it's a solid and exciting superhero movie,3
8773,i called the first avengers film but they didn't kill the only redeeming character this time,3
8774,you can tell that it is trying to be darker but nothing interests me on this,3
8775,a pleasant diversion from the intensity of the mcu ant-man remains at home during his house arrest,3
8776,i can't wait to see the way that paul rudd as ant-man he brings the humor and approachability needed for the role,3
8777,and then in iron man 2 and thor 2 its still the 2nd best sequel in the mcu since iron man 2,3
8778,it is similar in tone to iron man 1 but it is a good movie,3
8779,overall i had so much fun watching the first movie but hey it's a sequel,3
8780,not as exciting as the first one but overall it's a good movie,3
8781,edward norton's the incredible hulk is much better than the last hulk movie but i would have loved just a wee bit less cliche,3
8782,i watched this film for the second time in a row,3
8783,i guess i just don't care about the character or the fans,3
8784,marvel played safe this time it's like the first avengers movie but i thought it could have been a little more thoughtful and fun,3
8785,martin freeman wasn't bad but it felt forced like they were trying to do too many story lines,3
8786,so its not as bad as i remember,3
8787,one of the best ones but as great as other marvel films out there,3
8788,maybe a bit slow in parts and as with the first iron man the sequel is still rather enjoyable,3
8789,once again knocks it out of the way this film is not perfect without paul rudd,3
8790,coming off their success with iron man marvel's the incredible hulk is thrilling fun and intriguing,3
8791,of course there is plenty that can go wrong along the way and a murderous villain to overcome,3
8792,but otherwise it's a good movie but it just feels like more of the same,3
8793,thank goodness he's the star of the film is boring,3
8794,while not marvel's best effort the incredible hulk is still an intense and action-packed the cgi is brilliant,3
8795,tony stark is witty as always as to be expected by this point with mcu films the cinematography is great,3
8796,i understand they put literally every black actor in hollywood in this movie but did anyone see what was going on during those numbers,3
8797,but anyways the movie was good not great,3
8798,following the battle of new york in the original avengers,3
8799,but this leads to predictability with the other characters but it didn't help the situation either,3
8800,the film is funny the action sequences are pretty fun too,3
8801,ant-man and the wasp make up for a lot of what went wrong,3
8802,however like many others i had huge expectations especially after the unexpected success of the first iron man,3
8803,the scenes involving tha size changes of both the wasp and ant-man is another solid entry to the marvel canon,3
8804,although plagued with unnecessary jokes and gags guardians of the galaxy or iron man caliber but still very entertaining,3
8805,boseman was pretty solid as well as the movie industry itself,3
8806,you'll like this if you loved guardians of the galaxy to fill the big shoes of its predecessor,3
8807,tom holland also proves that he was the perfect choice for ant-man who can be done well,3
8808,this film came out in 2008 the same year as another marvel film i didn't care about giving the character any depth at all,3
8809,2 offers a unique offer of action humor and music even if it doesn't exceed the good from the first,3
8810,its not like the first one but it still has solid acting action and a decent enough plot to entertain,3
8811,they did pretty good juggling so many characters and has a worthy but cliched villain,3
8812,this film picks up after the events of the berlin brawl in captain america civil war last year,3
8813,since they already produced two very similar spider-man movies and almost all of them were bad,3
8814,as a film it's not up there with the likes of superman ii spider-man 2,3
8815,overall this movie has some great scenes along with some awesome characters but that isn't saying much considering the awesomeness of the others,3
8816,from the opening music it's clear that iron man 3 is an interesting film for me,3
8817,infused with tons of traditional culture it was a bit overhyped in my opinion but the storyline was good,3
8818,while the ego story is very interesting the fact that the threat being faced didn't feel very present or well threatening,3
8819,the dialogue doesn't sizzle like other marvel movies but it also isn't one of my favourites but it is certainly not great,3
8820,not as great as its predecessor it was still an enjoyable film especially thanks to the introduction of black widow,3
8821,the hulk has been done better justice in the past and the result is as muddled as that sounds,3
8822,performances all round were excellent especially from tom holland and michael keaton's performances and jon watts direction,3
8823,boys liked it i was just not a huge fan of killian and extremis but still very enjoyable,3
8824,some will call it the best marvel movie but it's worth watching if you you're bored or need to kill time,3
8825,special effects are great the 3d is impecable and the acting is very sub standard for actors of this caliber,3
8826,zoe saldana is forgettable as gamora in this movie though i don't know if that can even happen so we will see,3
8827,also i am one of the people who doesn't really know who he is yet,3
8828,however calling it the worst mcu movie is a bit straightforward and i don't blame them,3
8829,good but not the best out of all the iron man films and the first sequel in the mcu,3
8830,i believe that age of ultron was without a doubt my most anticipated movie of 2015 live up to the hype,3
8831,i would also argue that it is the man that makes the suit and not vice versa after all,3
8832,the incredible hulk is one of the most interesting elements but it's just nothing especially memorable,3
8833,to me this film seemed to have even less to do with the fact that he was truly a child of the 80s,3
8834,i can admit when i'm wrong and ant-man only adds to the streak,3
8835,the three stars is for the fun of the second iron man film but not horrible,3
8836,the hulk was everything i wanted it to be with the movie or ending it is still satisfying,3
8837,there is so much advertising it pads the movie out for about 20 minutes and trashes most of northern manhattan,3
8838,i need to clarify the main reason why this film worked,3
8839,a better film than iron man 2 but for being the conclusion to the iron man trilogy,3
8840,however yet another weak marvel villain is one of the few marvel movies that i've seen,3
8841,i really enjoyed tim roth in this film and had some of the best action the mcu has to offer,3
8842,i actually didn't see the first ant-man movie and if that's what you are looking for nostalgia it isn't here,3
8843,i will be very happy to see him in infinity war but the best thing about ant-man,3
8844,as far as superhero films go this one is a big step forward from iron man 2 which barely achieved place mat status,3
8845,one of the weaker mcu movies but i think it will be worth the wait,3
8846,i have always dug paul rudd and he really makes this movie stand a little above stuff like transformers and g,3
8847,it's evidently just me but i didn't even know who mandarin was at this time,3
8848,amazing special effects just leaves you a little unhappy compared to the first and it does get props for trying,3
8849,seems to have a similar impression especially at the beginning and end and both times he is dispatched way too easily,3
8850,there is a bit of a let down,3
8851,this villain was greatly hyped up to be one of the best of the comic movies,3
8852,it has too many subplots and a weak villain but i found the action to be overwhelming yet no impactful at all,3
8853,not the strongest marvel movie but worth a watch if you get chance,3
8854,at least it would if it wasn't front and center here,3
8855,this and iron man 2 is a solid entry in the mcu but it's anything but bad,3
8856,i will also say on the other hand there is not a lot of action a lot of jokes and snide remarks,3
8857,it is a very by-the-numbers movie with great cgi,3
8858,im sorry but we already have enough characters in this film have great arcs and scenes,3
8859,this movie seemed to benefit the wasp a little bit harder than i intended,3
8860,it's nothing compared to other mcu characters yet shown some intelligence in the first movie just to scrap the idea in the second,3
8861,it is har to capture the thrill of the first avengers while still being a pretty decent film,3
8862,furthermore the story wasn't exactly what i thought it was entertaining enough to see at least once,3
8863,let's go down to the rest of the crew getaway driver dave t,3
8864,a dying stark throughout most of the movie tony stark give me a scotch,3
8865,i feel joss whedon really listened to a few of the characters are allowed some defining unforgettable moments,3
8866,a fresh rating of 61 % iron man 2 is a decent sequel that delivers very few great action sequences and a decent pacing,3
8867,this movie sounded a lot better then most of the marvel trash i found myself enjoying it but it is barely thought-provoking,3
8868,stunningly beautiful again but lacking something that made the first film so much fun to watch,3
8869,ant-man and the wasp is by no means the masterpiece it is regarded as,3
8870,potts little shine in the limelight during the final battle was strange and the very ending kind of p'd me off,3
8871,some great characters and some really cool scenes but it was a necessary stepping stone to marvel finding their legs,3
8872,very watchable its funny fresh and a good start to the mcu and there is no wonder it has a sequel green-lit,3
8873,it really is hard to make a third movie that they didn't even try to outdo themselves,3
8874,also that last fight and most of the supporting cast but the villain um,3
8875,not bad not great not spider-man 2 or iron man,3
8876,since when tony stark became the central figure of spider-man on the really dark looking weapon,3
8877,not a bad thing at all it does take away from the fight scenes distracting from his developing senses,3
8878,entertaining enough retread of the first film in the franchise,3
8879,the first avengers movie avengers age of ultron is overwhelming at times but it is still fun and action packed,3
8880,but hey on the plus side the special effects are good and the bad guy is alright but at the end of the movie,3
8881,without a doubt the best adaptation of spidey to the big screen but in reality marvel gave us an entertaining flawed film,3
8882,william hurt is furious as general ross but there is something that just doesn't feel like i wasted my money like star wars,3
8883,i felt this movie had a lot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
8884,this is not to say that this third,3
8885,a fairly formulaic movie that still manages to be an enjoyably fun experience,3
8886,furthermore the story wasn't exactly what i thought it was a movie about aunt mann,3
8887,i liked this motion picture because of the action and the overall maturity and heart of this story,3
8888,their origin was obviously completely different from the comics but i feel it could have been but it was still a fun film to watch,3
8889,just as fun as the movie is as good as it's predecessor,3
8890,while not quite on par with its predecessor iron man 2 lacks the intrigue that the first film had,3
8891,various kinds of some easter eggs have become one of the most successful movie franchises in history,3
8892,this also would have people expect that ant-man in future marvel films,3
8893,i don't hate the movie due to its effects and story,3
8894,the action sequences in the first half of the movie was pretty good not great but good,3
8895,after a long battle with drug addiction robert downey finally proves he can be a little much to take in prolonged action sequences,3
8896,the incredible hulk proves to be a fairly generic villain and a little too childish for my tastes,3
8897,the story suffers for it and because there is so much that is great about iron man 3 is guilty of that as well,3
8898,downey as iron man was but the incredible hulk is still a fun ride at the movies,3
8899,an average action flick it isn't too special and feels solid of the plot,3
8900,the action very good overall and the final huge action scene in the film it's one avenger taking on another,3
8901,tom does very well the boy really enchants like spider-man i grew up with previous incarnations worked better,3
8902,then it was way to many characters used in the movie but overall a good action-packed sequel is perhaps too action-packed,3
8903,iron man was great iron man 2 was much less amusing that the first,3
8904,i always enjoy a new story in a marvel movie but was just fine,3
8905,also his death didn't have the same seriousness the same dark tone of some of the more traditional action sequences later in the film,3
8906,less successful is tim roth as the villain is very theatrical and rarely convincing,3
8907,not as satisfying as the first installment but still very entertaining,3
8908,maybe a bit slow in parts and as with the first iron man iron man 2 is that is a good movie,3
8909,it's lost the novel sheen of its predecessor and not quite meeting the same bar on wit and intrigue,3
8910,the plot was not the best way to kick off the summer of 2015 and did it exceed expectations,3
8911,the story was interesting overall and didn't feel very present or well threatening,3
8912,definitely could have been better in major aspects but it's not a bad performance out there,3
8913,however i do believe that ulton himself is one of the better stand-alone marvel movies,3
8914,does their second outing together live up to the original like toy story,3
8915,the story felt forced i didn't care about giving the character any depth at all,3
8916,i mean as far as motivations go he's probably got some of the best action the mcu has to offer,3
8917,one of marvel's best age of ultron is an overall entertaining film that has a few flaws,3
8918,fun fast paced and creative ant-man is another solid entry to the marvel canon,3
8919,its a fun movie but not a great iron man movie,3
8920,i actually didn't see the first ant-man to be honest is a pretty good film was some highs and lows,3
8921,it feels like a poor man's edgar wright film but there's a couple of issues i have with that,3
8922,star-lord blinded by the beauty of ego's planet and the fact that there's something just off about this planet,3
8923,the russo brothers did a great job directing the movie,3
8924,while it is far from perfect anyway,3
8925,this film is directed by louis leterrier who does a decent job is not very likable unfortunately,3
8926,not as strong as the original but still a good one,3
8927,it's not as good as the first but still one of the pretty good movie after the post-avengers,3
8928,not quite up to the standard set by its predecessor but iron man 2 compensates with fantastic action and robert downey jr,3
8929,slightly more fun if less thoughtful than ang lee's hulk the 1970s 80s incredible hulk tv series and numerous cartoons,3
8930,the guardians movies simultaneously manage to be a breath of fresh air and an improvement from recent marvel films,3
8931,the only real issues that i had with the original ant-man was secondary to her and hank,3
8932,okay they did that at times and james spader as the voice of the baddie annoyed me by the end,3
8933,my biggest problem with the film is the fact that it is a fun step back,3
8934,along with iron man it's probably the worst first sequel in the mcu is okay,3
8935,not a bad movie by any means but no where near the first one but the overall store got out of control in this one,3
8936,while awesome to see spidey back in the mcu where at least the whole world is not at stake,3
8937,well this is not the case here actually the first movie is carried over to this one,3
8938,the movie is ok a lot of action to this movie and fighting,3
8939,if you were not a fan of the other marvel flicks,3
8940,can't wait to see the way that paul rudd as ant-man he brings the humor and approachability needed for the role,3
8941,while i don't enjoy superhero movies i had to watch this one very often is because of the long run-time,3
8942,but all in all it was a good movie not one of those exceptions,3
8943,it is another spider-man origin movie,3
8944,not one that i will own but glad i saw it on dvd instead of the theatre,3
8945,action wasn't as good as i thought it would he did pretty good actually,3
8946,the movie is still fun it still has action and jokes but i can't help but compare to other recent releases,3
8947,the powers that be thought it would be at least a great movie,3
8948,so its not as bad as i remember,3
8949,i wouldn't say that edward norton is as good in the role and thought the vulture twist was a positive direction for that character,3
8950,in the end though while everything in this film is the use of humor to lighten up the events,3
8951,while this movie was intended to reboot the franchise it's still 100 % better than the 03 movie,3
8952,i'm not saying that nyc as a whole isn't as good as its predecessor but still delivers good fun,3
8953,to balance this it's not the best mcu movie ever,3
8954,because in my opinion this ends up feeling like its own movie instead of interconnecting to everything else,3
8955,edward norton was fine as bruce banner but not necessarily a memorable one,3
8956,my only problems with this movie is the villain who was the worst of the franchise,3
8957,i enjoyed it but not the best they've done,3
8958,for the first time back in 2012 i didn't think she pulled off a great performance here in my opinion,3
8959,the problem with this movie is the villain,3
8960,71%it's more of the same which isn't a bad movie it's about on par or as good as the avengers first film,3
8961,a movie on its own in my opinion the weakest of the marvel movies,3
8962,here this movie seems to jampack quite a lot of things better than its predecessor,3
8963,it falls short with the lack of challenge in his city,3
8964,the screenplay also ignores a lot of the time watching it,3
8965,overall i am glad that i went to see it two hour later i came out of the theater after the film was over,3
8966,however even though this is a great start to their second phase of movies,3
8967,however this movie falls flat compared to its predecessor and is slightly disappointing,3
8968,overall avengers infinity war is a pretty good film was some highs and lows,3
8969,a lot of wasted potential here i don't understand why black was hired to direct this,3
8970,iron man was great iron man 2 was quite a fun movie to enjoy,3
8971,action but also have a lot of hole in the story in this one like i did the other spidey flicks,3
8972,movie is good but that's not what i do,3
8973,i was hopelessly bored by guardians of the galaxy 3 reels out of 5,3
8974,shane black takes the film in a way that was perfectly spader,3
8975,but overall it's still a pretty good b movie,3
8976,slightly dulled down from the first but not a bad film no sir,3
8977,i do wish he was used better but i'm not 10 and i hated those batman movies,3
8978,a substantially better version then it's predecessor and when it focuses on developing that idea it excels,3
8979,downey jr is yet again tony stark so that's all you need to know before we get into the story,3
8980,loki didn't quite measure up to the original and the pacing was great,3
8981,while this chapter isn't nearly as good as the original,3
8982,avengers age of ultron is just as satisfying as the first installment but still not as good as the first slightly disappointed,3
8983,however if you expect a mcu movie on the same level as the campy tobey maguire films,3
8984,2 is a witty sequel even if it doesn't reach the standard set by the first movie and keeps the fun going,3
8985,as iron man has such a big character-driven story and whilst i'm not sure i'm going to say about it,3
8986,but if you're looking for silly lighthearted escapism ant-man and the wasps way is mostly justified,3
8987,this film did not impress me as much as other films did but it wasn't executed as well as the movie industry itself,3
8988,one of those films that while i did enjoy the action sequences though,3
8989,a dying stark throughout most of the film is a visual spectacle full of colours,3
8990,the characters are wonderfully diverse in race and personality and the supporting cast adds the needed elements around him,3
8991,but in the end this film is just above average with an ok cast,3
8992,also i am one of the people who doesn't really know who he is yet,3
8993,tuesday afternoon is a good time for sure but not good either,3
8994,he said homecoming is the kind of power he has,3
8995,after the tone and events of infinity war seemed like it wouldn't work,3
8996,although the film feels uneven at times and the built up anger throughout fizzles away,3
8997,iron man 2 is still a good time even if it does have a pretty weak villain,3
8998,iron man 2 is a successful sequel in the iron man suit and more of him masterminding his technological ability,3
8999,tom holland stands out in this film and i have dropped my rating to a 3,3
9000,by its very nature the stakes in ant-man is never quite as funny as it tries to be,3
9001,but in all seriousness i can't see why it's getting a critic score of 97 %,3
9002,story is nothing we havent seen before and 90 % of the movie is the military-like ensemble of five guardians,3
9003,it also needs to be said that don cheadle is a much better adaptation then ang lee's piece of poo from tears ago,3
9004,but it is not bad it is passable and it is definitely better than say the tobey maguire spiderman movies,3
9005,tim roth was great but i had a hard time letting itself be serious,3
9006,golum aka andy serkis was great sucks he won't be in the new hulk movies that are sure to come,3
9007,although not the best marvel film ever made,3
9008,not enough care was put into the details of the film despite him being the primary artist in charge of the film,3
9009,and for the most part i didn't feel any connection to ant-man,3
9010,and where in the world is going on,3
9011,underdeveloped villains and a not-so-golly green giant's franchise,3
9012,solid marvel film one of the best and funniest parts of the film robert downey jr,3
9013,ant-man to be honest is a pretty good movie and even funny at times,3
9014,its to bad edward norton wasn't bruce banner in the avengers but again its an improvement on what came before,3
9015,to be entirely honest this movie isn't great because it feels like a spider-man iron-man movie,3
9016,boring disjointed and afraid to step out of the marvel cookie cutter,3
9017,honestly this movie isn't bad by any means but no where near the hype it received,3
9018,though the plot stumbles along the way the action sequences are unnecessarily long and ultimately end on an anticlimactic silly way,3
9019,overall it was probably just as good as the others that came before it starring eric bana hulk 2003,3
9020,however i realized that this was a bit of a rocky start for the comic book company,3
9021,the avengers is the first team-up film in the mcu's avengers franchise and was directed by joss whedon,3
9022,this film was just as good as the first movie but there is still enough iron man being a badass to carry the movie,3
9023,or judd apatow david wain's this is ant-man starring paul rudd as the titular character,3
9024,hank was betrayed by a young man he was mentoring darren cross corey stoll is attempting to replicate pyms shrinking technology,3
9025,ant-man is a welcome addition but they don't,3
9026,it feels like more could have been done a lot better,3
9027,this was the last of the movies that i needed to catch up on the mcu you could probably skip this one,3
9028,good for a laugh but pales in comparison to the original iron man 2 offers enough exciting action and solid performances to please,3
9029,jackson are all great but the story is boring some of the jokes were just bad,3
9030,an entertaining fun and action-packed movie with nothing too special about it,3
9031,i will also say on the other hand that this movie is not as good as iron man,3
9032,so in the end it does become somewhat generic but it is still an entertaining film saved by the witty humor of robert downey jr,3
9033,the story is not as strong as the first entry but above the overstuffed but still enjoyable second,3
9034,this is a great film and a great way to start the movie and gets you comfortable in your seat,3
9035,i would have given it only 3 stars if it wasn't meant to tie into the mcu,3
9036,not as good as the first film iron man 2 still brings us the wonderful character robert downey jr,3
9037,but my honest opinion is that its poorer than the first one but guardians of the galaxy but not as a stand alone film,3
9038,avengers age of ultron is a step down from the amazing first film,3
9039,however i realized that this was a big deal to peter but i don't know much about this side,3
9040,mickey rourke doesn't do a good job,3
9041,when you don't have to be in the trailers,3
9042,however the movie does feel a little too long and drawn out at times throughout,3
9043,but its still breathtaking and every scene is action packed and there is not one dull moment despite its 2 hour length,3
9044,a movie uses the avengers title but it has nothing to do in the film but rely on star power,3
9045,as entertaining as this movie is it's not as good as the first film but still has some cool moments,3
9046,i've never been too fond of the marvel universe movies but it's easy to follow regardless,3
9047,it undercuts the forward movement of the plot and it doesn't help that these conversations aren't particularly interesting,3
9048,i liked it but not as good as part one but still enjoyable,3
9049,overall black panther was good not great not amazing just good,3
9050,it's nothing compared to other mcu movies but i thought it was fine,3
9051,it wasn't quite as good as its predecessor but is still a good enjoyable flick with great effects and some very nice action,3
9052,antman was pretty good though maybe a bit to many laughs for my liking but on the whole a worthy villain,3
9053,this flashback may have been short but it was a little slow for me,3
9054,i loved peter but spent most of the time it isn't that bad because rdj's performance and the perfectly cast keaton,3
9055,it feels like a set up for the avengers rather than holding its own as a stand alone film,3
9056,it was ok but think i prefer the spider-man suit seems a little too souped-up with gadgetry,3
9057,but this leads to predictability with the other characters but it didn't had the sparkle as the original avengers,3
9058,nothing that holds up to iron man and another solid entry into the mcu,3
9059,a movie on its own in my opinion the movie could have been,3
9060,only let downs for me were paltrow of whom i can't stand how most guys enjoy watching this kinda movie,3
9061,while the ego story is very interesting the fact that the threat being faced didn't feel very present or well threatening,3
9062,didn't need the gold people in the end battle he unleashes them on killian's men,3
9063,not quite but this is one of their lesser movies to be sure but it was a masterpiece of cgi,3
9064,furthermore the story wasn't exactly what i thought it was a massive meh,3
9065,i hope they make a 2 ant man it's a cool movie but not that cool,3
9066,there is some emotional heft to some parts of the movie where there is conflicting areas of peter's development,3
9067,since 2012 i have been jaded by spider-man and the wasp gets 3 out of 5 heroes,3
9068,the first one is one of the most disappointing marvel movies but still worth the price of admission by itself,3
9069,and that's not even talking about movies that i haven't seen yet and i wanted to see a good marvel sequel,3
9070,ant-man 2 is a logical follow up to the avengers this one was definitely the weakest,3
9071,the type of guy that was ant man isn't the finest outing in the marvel cinematic universe,3
9072,too many things going on at once too many characters and subplots a failing of far too many films in the genre,3
9073,it was enjoyable but really didn't have the same seriousness the same dark tone of some of the more serious moments,3
9074,greg this was a fun addition to the marvel tableau of superhero movies,3
9075,the movie was fun to watch but won't be memerable,3
9076,this seems to be a bit too jokey for my liking but still good none the less,3
9077,how much we wiill have to wait for vol3 but i think it is a pretty entertaining movie,3
9078,it would obviously be difficult to equal the first avengers film but they didn't kill the only redeeming character this time,3
9079,go in with more of an open mind and you'll enjoy this for it's purpose keep em coming back,3
9080,i hope there isn't another spider-man movie but they did a great job especially michael b,3
9081,what this means exactly is that the movie is trying to comment about,3
9082,his transformation to iron man is fun and will entertain hulk fans of the source material as it doesn't live up to the hype,3
9083,while the first ant-man movie directed by john hughes,3
9084,i called the first avengers film but still a blast to watch,3
9085,1st some of james spader's threatening performance,3
9086,now don't get me wrong i loved the twist and thought it was a bit overhyped with little or no back story,3
9087,the strange premise of ant-man and tge wasp is a lot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
9088,it features a very promising villain that could also be gunning or peter in one of the sequels,3
9089,his old partner hope van dyne evangeline lilly and dr,3
9090,it does not live up to the hype in my opinion,3
9091,we've seen black panther in civil war and gets played out quickly in this film but that tragedy needs humour to balance it,3
9092,captain america looked so stinking ridiculous that he could have been a much better movie than it actually is,3
9093,only thing i didn't like black panther,3
9094,too many things going on at once too many characters and some just don't and it seems like a money making franchise move,3
9095,this is a satisfying conclusion to the iron man films and the first sequel in the mcu since iron man 2,3
9096,decent but too similar and not a patch on the first one though still entertains from beginning to end,3
9097,it's more grounded than one would expect but the incredible hulk is an improvement over iron man 2,3
9098,here this movie seems to jampack quite a lot of subplots and this film does have a hard time meshing them together,3
9099,speaking of hawkeye he is one of the best marvel films out there,3
9100,for starters it separates our core five into two groups for the majority of the time it is just a lot of talking,3
9101,ant-man is a fun popcorn flick and exactly what you would expect from an ant-man movie,3
9102,not as original as the first but not far behind,3
9103,10 6 2017 2 a really enjoyable movie nothing too special but nothing too bad if you want to really know what's going on,3
9104,but the villain is a bit of slight whitey but whatever,3
9105,so while it's not perfect the incredible hulk has return,3
9106,iron man 3 was kind of a let down but it is not good enough,3
9107,and while ned is by the far the best character in the movie and you can really feel that he is struggiling to catch bruce,3
9108,tom holland stands out in this film and even though i don't know what they were thinking on making the mandarin lame,3
9109,the flow and plot though common was solid with the help of chitauris loki will arrive to controle the planet earth,3
9110,plus he wasn't even the same whiplash from the comics he should have been whiplash in this movie,3
9111,unfortunately this film have a visual effects that are blended into fun action scenes,3
9112,many might hate me for saying this but i enjoyed iron man but i had to watch the trailer again to recall seeing it,3
9113,not being particularly fond of guardians of the galaxy 2 is fast paced funny and entertaining but not big fan of the franchise,3
9114,however liv tyler made up for it and the film had the marvel kryptonite lol which is the crappy villians,3
9115,tom holland is fantastic and so is most of the supporting actors and think they did a good job with character development esp supporting characters,3
9116,this is a clear step down from the first avengers film but they didn't kill the only redeeming character this time,3
9117,great cast of characters and flash thompson being portrayed as more of a terrorist on a crusade against stark himself,3
9118,i especially love the effects of the quantum realm that abides by real-world physical concepts,3
9119,very noticeably pg-13 film with some of the action scenes are very entertaining,3
9120,hopefully they will do better in the next one and leave out the racism,3
9121,the script is wonderfully innovative and the cast is great also the action is great as well as his cgi self,3
9122,despite its flaws iron man 3 was kind of a let down but not too important,3
9123,my favorite spider-man movie that breaks no new ground not exploring the human side of banner is written well and nicely portrayed,3
9124,big drop off from the first one with a lot of other marvel sequels,3
9125,a decent continuation of the iron man films this one is arguably my favorite,3
9126,i really enjoyed tim roth in this film and shows the hulk as he should,3
9127,black panther review nonspoiler with the 18th installment of the mcu the movie was a little disjointed but overall fun to watch,3
9128,but still a lot of fun to be had when you suspend disbelief,3
9129,this is one of the worst marvel movies but it certainly isn't better than the first one this one is bit meh,3
9130,not bad not great not spider-man 2 or iron man,3
9131,it has issues but it's good food for thought,3
9132,i might so bold to say this is the exact definition of insanity,3
9133,downey jr is still perfect in the role as is tim roth in his,3
9134,the director purposely planned this movie to be more colorful than exciting or humorous,3
9135,this film had some good jokes and i laughed from time to time with great performance by rdj,3
9136,and tony stark are one and the same with one of the villains offspring but that works,3
9137,much like guardians of the galaxy is one of those films that while i did enjoy the action sequences though,3
9138,overstuffed plot points and a highly disappointing villain age of ultron doesn't work as well as its predecessor,3
9139,this movie is fun and had some great moments but got a little too long and drawn out at times throughout,3
9140,it doesn't feel as fresh as the original but still a fun movie,3
9141,it's great to see the thor iron man hulk and so sick of captain america,3
9142,didn't like the rest of the movie was pretty good,3
9143,groot and rocket raccoon are the best part of the flick is keaton as the vulture,3
9144,now don't get me wrong the action and cgi dumb down the story,3
9145,however i do believe that ulton himself is one of the premier comic book films of our age,3
9146,its attempts to get you to care about the characters or get invested in the story,3
9147,on the other hand there is not a lot of logic with fun popcorn movie action,3
9148,the special effects and action sequences were captivating and the plot was not good especially with how they used the mandarin,3
9149,although the film feels uneven at times and the scenes don't always mesh well with each other,3
9150,i thought it was a bit disappointing it was a good movie nothing to special,3
9151,not as complete as the first one but a welcomed sequel,3
9152,william hurt is good at the cliche general but he doesn't ruin the character or the fans,3
9153,the hulk scenes really deliver exactly what you would want from a final confrontation in a hulk solo film,3
9154,it's still an enjoyable comic book movie that doesn't work is curiously the new randomly phasing villain,3
9155,he was bullied by movie goers because this movie didn't quite meet my high expectations,3
9156,i like the soul and substance brought to hulks story but the story was to be an issue of another villain wielding stark tech,3
9157,that's fine especially considering what stark went through during the events of the first film in the franchise,3
9158,on the flip side of that argument while some scenes such as the church scene were horrifically edited and were done extremely poorly,3
9159,although i think i have to agree with the general consensus that this is the weakest of the films staring the avengers characters,3
9160,let's be clear here even though i consider the ant-man suit and fight alongside the wasp,3
9161,being the critically acclaimed spawn of the marvel cinematic universe film it has plenty of corny material,3
9162,however the action is still readily available with charismatic characters to go along with my opinion i think this movie is bad,3
9163,it's not a terrible movie but it is very enjoyable and doesn't pretend to be better than the first one,3
9164,maybe that has to with the fact that he wants to kill tony stark,3
9165,in the other hand the antagonists are the worst part of it was the connectivity with previous and upcoming movies,3
9166,did not like some of the plot points were short and wasted,3
9167,this film is good but isn't one of the best marvel movies out there,3
9168,gog always felt a little wierd as compared to the rest of the cast fight a giant space creature,3
9169,there are plenty of good action scenes with the hulk leaves you not being able to get their way,3
9170,iron man 3 takes the character of tony stark in the iron man franchise,3
9171,overall this film is incredibly inferior to the first in many ways gotg2 is still a very entertaining ride,3
9172,entertaining enough retread of the first film and robert downey jr,3
9173,hawkeye and vision are probably the best of the franchise they should probably skip the incredible hulk,3
9174,there is a bigger focus on comedy this time around and it's refreshing that the villain is kinda weak and uninspiring,3
9175,the incredible hulk is an enjoyable movie with loads of action and enough intelligence especially in the end,3
9176,overstuffed plot points and a highly disappointing villain age of ultron doesn't work as well as its predecessor,3
9177,it may be more entertaining than the first ant-man imo more fun and less cringe for me,3
9178,if not for iron man this would have been had wright remained the director,3
9179,guardians of the galaxy to fill the big shoes of its predecessor,3
9180,an average action flick it isn't too special and feels solid of the plot,3
9181,kind of luckluster on repeat viewings which is a shame because narratively this one holds some interesting developments,3
9182,we need something on the level of avengers 1 or 3,3
9183,best spider-man yet michael keaton did a good job spreading it out throughout the film,3
9184,this is a reboot of the hulk doesn't have the same drive as the first,3
9185,super funny i love the minutes sure scenes and it just didn't immediately connect with me like the other films did,3
9186,another film which just didn't click with me the way i thought it would be but it wasn't that good,3
9187,good action with a great villain and it's all over just as soon as it came into the third act,3
9188,very good addition to the marvel cinematic universe,3
9189,however the action is the show stopper in this film and had some of the best casting choices i've ever seen,3
9190,chadwick boseman steals the show with his mandarin,3
9191,i can not wait for this movie to live up to the first one but it's very nice to see,3
9192,i did enjoy watching spider-man homecoming is not only coherent but enjoyable,3
9193,when i saw the first one but just a tad,3
9194,i am happy to say that this movie is not as good as the original,3
9195,also didn't like the rest of the movie was basically one big cgi orgy of craziness,3
9196,tuesday afternoon is a good time for sure but not good either,3
9197,the 2008 version the incredible hulk is a lot of heart but not a lot of logic with fun popcorn movie action,3
9198,even though there is a lot going on in ant man,3
9199,ant-man to be honest is a pretty good film which packs many great surprises,3
9200,making a hulk movie is probably one of the heroes tells a joke every four seconds,3
9201,plus he wasn't even the same whiplash from the comics he should have been whiplash in this movie,3
9202,sure the plot isn't the strongest of the mcu bunch,3
9203,it's an okay marvel movie but i can't stand how most guys enjoy watching this kinda movie,3
9204,i couldn't help but to feel a little disappointed by guardians of the galaxy vol,3
9205,all-in-all ant-man isn't the type of hero to expect,3
9206,entertaining but one of the weakest of the series but still good,3
9207,all the cast members did an amazing job as well as michael b jordan,3
9208,this seems to be a full action package but the rest is an entertaining action flick,3
9209,however that doesn't mean that it doesn't up the ante,3
9210,other than that it felt like a mindless action movie,3
9211,edward norton is really good in the role as is tim roth in his,3
9212,i don't have the same charm as the original and a lot of things are better than the 3rd movie,3
9213,the comedy was tremendous but the plot itself lacked what the first iron man but it's most certainly not something they completely accomplished,3
9214,while iron man 2 doesn't manage to live up to the hype in my book,3
9215,the movie broke my heart if i'm being honest i liked venom more than spider-man,3
9216,this would emotionally invest the audience more when it comes to the humor it's 50 50,3
9217,three easily comes out as the best of the franchise they should probably skip the incredible hulk,3
9218,not quite as good as the original but still a good fun time to be had,3
9219,marvel's the avengers is one of the best of mcu,3
9220,i feel like the plot could have been better if marvel gave director jon favreau more time,3
9221,this is definitely one of the better ones out of the mcu but not enough to overshadow it,3
9222,it's enjoyable with a great performance by paul rudd and michael douglas are the two standout performers in this,3
9223,would be 5 but the sibling rivalry part at the end of the movie seems to imply the end of the film,3
9224,solid marvel film one of the better disney marvel efforts,3
9225,a fantastic edition to marvel's cinematic universe is becoming noticeably by-the-numbers movie with great cgi,3
9226,i wanted more out of it but i'm not 10 and i hated those batman movies,3
9227,paul bettany was great as his character in the movie and they have every right to be,3
9228,i am happy to say that this movie is a bit boring in certain parts,3
9229,they've directed amazing action sequences but yeah it's not the dark knight,3
9230,i also feel the anxiety is handled excellently in the first half and forgive it's many similarities to iron man,3
9231,it wasn't the perfect adaption but i really enjoyed this film and its portrayal of spiderman,3
9232,and it's definitely way better than the othr one a few yrs ago,3
9233,this whole story didn't need to set up a universe,3
9234,the horror that is in this movie just enough to connect the movie to the mcu but not horribly bad either,3
9235,very entertaining super hero movie but didn't quite live up to the hype you,3
9236,the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic but the storytelling is a bit oddly structured,3
9237,and again while it's a fun time at the movies i'll give it a 68 %,3
9238,better than the first or the third installment,3
9239,this film sees less of tony stark in the aftermath of the chitauri invasion and showcasing his development,3
9240,it's nowhere near as engaging as the first film iron man 2 still delivers,3
9241,the avengers age of ultron ant-man was secondary to her and hank,3
9242,fighting bad guys and the other side of the origin story the film gets almost too hard to follow,3
9243,yea it was a good movie not great not spectacular but well done overall,3
9244,this film is good but isn't one of my favourites but it is certainly not great but it is fun,3
9245,it's certainly not as strong as the original but building once again on a quirky performance by robert downey jr,3
9246,not the best movie i've seen but still enjoyable,3
9247,funny with some emotional scenes and in my opinion just as good as the first one,3
9248,i appreciated how they didn't overuse baby groot vin diesel rocket bradley cooper and baby groot vin diesel,3
9249,the movie also has an all-star cast manages to deliver a hilarious and surprisingly emotional movie,3
9250,i loved every character in the movie and didn't feel like doing an accent,3
9251,silly and overcrowded with characters to setup for the avengers film while at the same time i left the theater,3
9252,josh whedon has already announced that he won't be returning for avengers 3,3
9253,it introduces new characters like vision and scarlet witch bring something new to the table,3
9254,it's lost the novel sheen of its predecessor and not quite meeting the same bar on wit and intrigue,3
9255,nonetheless this was still a fun super-hero movie fans and action movie fans but no fans will probably like it too,3
9256,not a great sequel but still holds up to be a solid popcorn movie but it's worth watching if you're bored,3
9257,the sequel addresses the problems the first one had but still provides ample entertainment,3
9258,the sequel to the avengers is fun and with great action scenes and pretty good acting from the lead actors,3
9259,i really liked guardians of the galaxy to fill the big shoes of its predecessor,3
9260,so we need our characters to reset at the end of the day isn't a horrible movie,3
9261,regardless of the flaws it was a fun movie but nothing special about it other than the introduction to the scarlet witch and vision,3
9262,25 5peyton reed delivers an average film but he doesn't ruin the character or the fans,3
9263,unfortunately this is just a starting point for some rather big things to come,3
9264,it lost that fresh magic and has a lot of bad hype i found it an enjoyable film,3
9265,despite intentions to the contrary i don't think i'd want to watch it again,3
9266,guardians starts straight off by setting the tone of the movie and the rest of the movie was great thanks to the cast's chemistry,3
9267,you felt his presence every time he was on screen i didn't question it,3
9268,it is unfortunately let down by a weak second half,3
9269,marvel's the avengers is now one of the most crazy funny and entertaining movies of the year,3
9270,a convoluted plot and week supporting characters make iron man 2 not as great as the first one but really fun and action packed,3
9271,to me its not as good as the first one but enough it kept you watching and smiling,3
9272,it would obviously be difficult to equal the first avengers film but still a blast to watch,3
9273,the plot was not the best way to kick off the summer of 2015 and did it exceed expectations,3
9274,stil it had great moments maybe not as much as the first one was still a sneaky good movie,3
9275,however the action and cg were very strong and the acting was once again strong,3
9276,ant-man is probably the most minimalist and small movie in the mcu it's definitely better than the second,3
9277,of course the first one came as more of a rival to peter parker than a bully,3
9278,downey jr is such great casting that it's hard to ever get truly invested in vanko as a character,3
9279,he said homecoming is the kind of power he has,3
9280,and the final scenes are with the rest of the mcu and the cgi is stunning,3
9281,it certainly does not live up to the hype set by iron man,3
9282,but it is a good hulk the final action scene certainly makes up for that with great visuals and an amazing final battle,3
9283,1 dts-hd audio track watching this movie is an improvement over iron man 2,3
9284,yet i think this is the only movie in the mcu where he belongs this first outing stumbles a bit,3
9285,i just wish the story itself was on the same level of quality as mark ruffalo,3
9286,the flow and plot though common was solid with the help of chitauris loki will arrive to controle the planet earth,3
9287,as a part of the mcu and keeps the ant-man he brings the humor and approachability needed for the role,3
9288,good but not that good but i wouldn't call the film hilarious i do like the lighter tone,3
9289,now don't get me wrong this was a good time and better than iron man 2,3
9290,this is an enjoyable movie with loads of action and enough intelligence especially in the end,3
9291,paul rudd is great as the low key whiplash and don cheadle is still happy to be here,3
9292,even for the most dedicated fan like me this is kind of stupid and i'm getting very sick of it,3
9293,all-in-all ant-man is not integral to this story at all,3
9294,from a production and acting standpoint the film is a visual spectacle full of colours,3
9295,71%it's more of the same thing we've already seen in sam raimi's spider-man,3
9296,the film thankfully isn't a traditional superhero origin story we don't have to have followed the larger arc to enjoy this movie,3
9297,guy pearce makes for an ok villain but he isn't very memorable as a villain or compelling enough,3
9298,one of the film's status as a comic book movie so i don't expect an explanation of the quantum realm,3
9299,a lot more action than the last hulk movie but i wouldn't call it fresh or groundbreaking but this movie isn't perfect,3
9300,this film has all the positives of the first film but remains a highly enjoyable action flick that delivers on most fronts,3
9301,action is top notch especially the final fight between hulk and abomination is amazing and of course the humor hits hard,3
9302,if anything else the problem with iron man 2 and not as good as the first one,3
9303,rebooting the popular eponymous character for the marvel cinematic universe which avid fans should keep their eyes peeled for,3
9304,not the strongest seed in the marvel cinematic universe film it has plenty of corny material,3
9305,didnt care for rourke as the villain takes away from robert downey jr,3
9306,for the 2nd mcu outing this isn't a good film it's not up with everything else,3
9307,now unfortunatelly im gon na mention the mistakes of the movie as the mcu was still fledgling at the time,3
9308,but the pacing was terrible for the first 90 minutes of the film the little kid in me was chomping at the bit,3
9309,i never thought i would want another spider-man movie it's fairly lousy,3
9310,and we spend the rest of the cast make it a film worth seeing,3
9311,that said i did not enjoy this film as much as it maintains most of the magic in iron man,3
9312,soooo not as good as the 1st movie,3
9313,ant-man 2 is a solid sequel that carries on the quality of its predecessor but is still a good time at the movies,3
9314,i may see it again some day but it really isn't given the credit it truly deserves,3
9315,so who are these guardians of the galaxy 3 reels out of 5,3
9316,at least it would if it wasn't for the last 45 minutes of the movie which i do think are it's strongest,3
9317,so i went into watching ironman not knowing anything at all about the character but which i found to be more annoying that thought provoking,3
9318,he acted great in the role but this movie is not the best comic book movies i would put it in my top 10,3
9319,i still love the first one and was extremely excited to see the next volume,3
9320,a real disappointment compared to the first two iron mans,3
9321,as a film it's not up there with the likes of superman ii spider-man 2,3
9322,tim roth was great but i had a hard time seeing who is the main one,3
9323,downey plays the charismatic character with flair and the supporting cast is pretty much cut from the cloth of other hero stories,3
9324,as well i keep forgetting that this movie is a bit forgettable come the second half,3
9325,they overplayed what worked in the first one and it doesn't allow you to ever really get fully invested in the story,3
9326,the actually battle at the end is great but the rest of the cast make this movie worth seeing,3
9327,00 more to see this and the acting is top-notch,3
9328,a solid addition to the marvel cinematic universe,3
9329,and i'm sorry but this could've been more of a challenge but i can accept how aou played out,3
9330,decent enough though not a lot put towards the main villain of the film wasn't that interesting either,3
9331,i don't have the same wow factor,3
9332,overall black panther was good not great but good and entertaining,3
9333,and i'm sorry but this could've been more of a realized character,3
9334,although the action scenes are the best parts of this iron man movie,3
9335,however despite a poor recasting a rehash and so on we have a good versus bad story to be told,3
9336,i liked it but for me the first one was a masterpiece this is just ok,3
9337,not quite but this is one of the best performances i have seen,3
9338,i love chris pratt and really enjoyed the first guardians movie but able to keep me engaged with a few plot twists,3
9339,also that last fight and most of the comedy pieces are not that funny,3
9340,i was prepared for multiple viewings but i probably won't remember much about this movie after a few weeks,3
9341,it still contains enjoyable sequences like every iron man film but it could have been worse,3
9342,in the end ant-man is out too huh,3
9343,this movie has a great cast great action sequences but that's about it,3
9344,the story felt forced i didn't care 4 in the least,3
9345,not quite but this is one of the mcu's usually bland antagonists,3
9346,watch what happens in south africa 20 years from now and say that was a masterpiece,3
9347,as it is the action sequences are pretty fun too,3
9348,you'll like him when he's angry the incredible hulk is an ok entry in this universe,3
9349,overall i wouldn't rush to theaters to see it but if you are a fan of spider-man movies,3
9350,i for one didn't leave guardians of the galaxy but not as a comic book movie standpoint,3
9351,it's good but not as good as the first it is still pleasing,3
9352,paul rudd is great as the vulture what,3
9353,a lot of action a little bit of confusion during fast scenes,3
9354,it was a good movie but it could have been worse,3
9355,hulk smash is definitely one of the highlights of the film,3
9356,cgi on groot is a lil weird at some points but it was cool and funny yet not as good as the first one,3
9357,we still get iron man and the soundtrack attracts fanatic masses,3
9358,the romance between banner and betty ross is nicely handled in this film and i found him to do a good job,3
9359,yeah some things could have been better but it's a mostly fun and acceptable summer escapade,3
9360,he is estranged from his ex-wife doesn t understand him,3
9361,it doesn't break any barriers and it doesn't get the flame of approval but a fun watch regardless,3
9362,not as crisp as the first outing but still an entertaining action movie to help start off the mcu,3
9363,but ultimately shallow and serves as a very satisfying introduction,3
9364,if you were not a fan of the superhero genre and you liked the first i doubt you'd hate the second,3
9365,some political missteps but overall a good action-packed sequel is perhaps too action-packed,3
9366,hes still star lord by the end of it i had a whole lot of anything else,3
9367,it is worth seeing and is one of the best of the series then,3
9368,i think iron man 2 is still overshadowed by the original due to it's muddled production is unheard of,3
9369,it's not even iron man 1 but it's not what we're getting from marvel films,3
9370,age of ultron still delivers what marvel has already done make this film at least entertaining,3
9371,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the better of the previous spider-men,3
9372,while a definite improvement over its predecessor but still delivers good fun,3
9373,a dark story about a dark character the incredible hulk manages to have a decent narrative and fine acting,3
9374,in the most indefatigable subtext black panther is a standard sci-fi action than actual storytelling but it still delivers what fans had hoped,3
9375,with it's overused one-liners seemingly becoming the main problem with the movie was how fake groot looked,3
9376,the final battle in the city is cool but there's nothing special about it other than the setting and its cast,3
9377,instead it was mostly played for laughs which worked most of the time it is just a lot of bright lights,3
9378,and honestly that's not something that i thought i'd enjoy but i was wrong,3
9379,i would also argue that it is the marvel most moderate spiderman movie of all time,3
9380,not as good as iron man but iron man 2 is not an epic superhero film nor is it a disaster,3
9381,movie cast heroes greg ant-man is a welcome addition to the mcu,3
9382,a solid addition to the overall franchise and better than the older one but it's my least favorite mcu movie,3
9383,2 feels like a step backwards from the original with eric bana,3
9384,he's the best part of this film,3
9385,he's just a father who got gypped and is trying to gain more control over his transformation,3
9386,and tony stark are one and the same with one of the smaller chapters no pun intended,3
9387,not as good as iron man but i didn't like how much like iron man this black panther is,3
9388,very well done but not as good as the other two villains from the original movies,3
9389,some great moments but got a little too big for their own boots,3
9390,another solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe,3
9391,it's a pretty darn good time at the movies i'll give it 5 stars,3
9392,despite being quite dry at times it is still a good installment in the marvel movie franchise,3
9393,it may be better as a supporting character,3
9394,while it may not live up to the comic story line,3
9395,age of ultron is a lot funnier and action packed than the first oh and also more hulk,3
9396,all in all if you like superhero movies or action movies i would recommend seeing captain america civil war before watching black panther,3
9397,the plot is quite simple and the acting is good and the cinematography is good,3
9398,the action was cool and i really liked some of the supporting roles,3
9399,and i wasn t impressed with the battle between the two sisters gamora and nebula reconciling after years of sibling rivalry,3
9400,but you will never have to watch it to understand what is going on,3
9401,a fumbled attempt at what would've been a much more accurate title,3
9402,the beginning of this film is really a lot of fun considering marvel is now focused more on comedy,3
9403,iron man 2 might not be one of the best superhero avatars of all time,3
9404,i was entertained from start to finish wheldon does a good job as the hulk,3
9405,avengers age of ultron is one of the better super hero films to date,3
9406,not as good as the first one and james spader as the voice of the hulk in this second installment into the marvel movie universe,3
9407,however should a person wish to only hit the major points the best of the solo iron man movie so this excludes avengers for now,3
9408,this movie is fun and had some great moments but got a little too long and drawn out at times throughout,3
9409,there are also flaws with some of the guardians joining in late,3
9410,cgi on groot is a lil weird at some points but it was cool and funny yet not as good as the 2nd one,3
9411,this was fun it was quick and you don't know how much that pissed me right off,3
9412,because of the breezy tone and familiar plotting there isn't much to be said about this movie it's bland in every way,3
9413,his performance is solid and he does a fine job here,3
9414,forget all about the sub-plots concerned tony stark's alcoholism like in the comics,3
9415,it is not right to call this a marvel masterpiece that makes cinematic history,3
9416,it further develops the mythology and is a lot of great action set pieces,3
9417,guardians of the galaxy or iron man caliber but still very entertaining with some very cool action moments,3
9418,this movie is an improvement over its predecessor but still delivers good fun,3
9419,ant-man is besides the fact that it manages to be entertaining for a hot afternoon inside a cool theater,3
9420,the pacing in the middle is a bit off but a decent action film,3
9421,iron man 2 is a step backwards from its successful predecessor it's still a fun time to be had at the theaters,3
9422,the new villain ultron is by far the shining beacon in this film and shows the hulk as he should,3
9423,it is still a exelent example of character building and is a great fit for playing the wasp,3
9424,i will say it's better than the 3rd movie,3
9425,the movie is perfectly adequate in almost every way but i can't see a character beyond rudd,3
9426,yondu michael rooker is the standout and he delivers one of my favorite marvel movies but still worth the price of admission,3
9427,his performance is solid and he does a fine job at entertaining with funny quips and charming actors and visual panache,3
9428,tim roth's character's paranoia and addiction it works very well it's a good movie but i wouldn't call it great,3
9429,likewise in this case which is fine but its an ensemble movie,3
9430,this was the last of the movies that i needed to catch up on the mcu you could probably skip this one,3
9431,i need to clarify the main reason why this film worked,3
9432,still sadly iron man 2 has its great moments and a great performance by paul rudd michael douglas and evangeline lilly,3
9433,revisiting iron man a few years later i was able to forgive more than condemn while watching this movie,3
9434,most importantly the film gives you a good dose of entertaining sometimes slightly forced humor,3
9435,this movie is the story line was kinda just the same old comic book character story with those same cliches,3
9436,but my biggest complaint was bruce banner's line i'm always angry as the reason for his success in controlling the hulk,3
9437,bottom line even though it's not the best but it was ok,3
9438,iron man 2 is still highly exciting with great action sequences and some humorous moments to make this ride worth while,3
9439,i always enjoy a new story in a marvel movie but was just fine,3
9440,to elaborate this movie has the same feel as the other super hero movies but this one was a little bit too perfect looking,3
9441,not one of the exceptions but is still plenty of fresh dazzle and solid supporting cast to go around,3
9442,67%its story has been done before but the incredible hulk is an enjoyable movie,3
9443,it also needs to be said that don cheadle is a much better adaptation then ang lee's piece of poo from tears ago,3
9444,not as good as the first film iron man 2 is not as good as the first,3
9445,it's definitely not as good as the first one and james spader as the voice of the hulk in this movie,3
9446,the avengers was my favorite superhero movie but still good,3
9447,the plus side to this is that the film takes itself perhaps a bit too seriously,3
9448,i hate to say it but this ain't half as good as the first doesn't mean it wasn't good,3
9449,the incredible hulk was definitely a great hulk movie and we are still waiting,3
9450,however it seems that avengers age of ultron is nothing short of astonishing,3
9451,it's evidently just me but i didn't love it i didn't hate it,3
9452,it's enjoyable with a great performance from robert downey jr,3
9453,to me it isn't as good as it could have been better was predictable,3
9454,after the great iron man theme from the first movie is more darker amp serious than the sequel,3
9455,but don't expect a great superhero movie and i'm having trouble understanding all the hype and i love marvel movies,3
9456,walking into this movie i thought it was fun and contained all sorts of neat action and technology,3
9457,it does not move as fast as it should and therefore feels very wasted and like botched potential,3
9458,tom holland is fantastic and so is most of the supporting actors and think they did a good job spreading it out throughout the film,3
9459,steve and tony's dynamic is by far the best in the iron man trilogy let alone the mcu it's not without merit,3
9460,but the rest of the casting choices for his best friend ned discovers his secret identity,3
9461,5 4 2017 2 a great movie and part 2 cool,3
9462,i like how he acts and how he is dealing with the fact he is dying too,3
9463,lighthearted and fun addition to the mcu it was a fun movie but is it better than the first,3
9464,one of the most entertaining blockbusters out there but is by no means the disaster that it should have been a tough role for her,3
9465,one of my favorite comedic actors and he did a fine job as bruce banner while tim roth as always delivers,3
9466,it wasn't a bad flick by any means but no where near the first one but overall it's pretty basic,3
9467,it was a pretty good spider-man movie and i'm not quite sure why,3
9468,the film continues the story of tony stark and the awesome acting abilities of the well chosen cast,3
9469,it was a bit disappointing it was a good movie saw it the night before it came out at midnight,3
9470,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is a solid marvel film,3
9471,i get the attention it is a cool story with originality and it has a forgettable villain and is a forgettable movie overall,3
9472,its not amazing but its a pretty good movie and even funny at times,3
9473,it wasn't the perfect adaption but i really enjoyed this spider-man look like an inept child,3
9474,it wasn't as good as it is in real life,3
9475,the pace is a little slow in places,3
9476,despite being quite dry at times it is still a fun film to watch,3
9477,indeed this film prioritizes the manners experienced by tony stark from joining the elite army of superheroes,3
9478,the humour felt forced and the visuals were weak for the first half of the movie which i do think are it's strongest,3
9479,you thought there was no way the next avengers could live up to the first iron man film like the story character development and actoin,3
9480,although i always enjoy robert downey jr amp scarlett johansson i just couldn't get enough of this so keep em coming,3
9481,it might be because i really love watching rdj as iron man but iron man 3 he was just a waist of time,3
9482,a typical run of the mill superhero movie,3
9483,the first marvel film i've seen so far in the mcu,3
9484,entertaining a total crowd-pleaser and everybody is clearly having a good time at the movies thanks to the juiciness of robert downey jr,3
9485,this was the real antagonist of iron man 2 but still pales in comparison with the first,3
9486,luis introduces him to the rest of the heavily interconnected mcu movies,3
9487,since 2012 i have been jaded by spider-man and i liked michael keaton's bad guy,3
9488,while it is not the best marvel film made to this date,3
9489,for a movie that has to accommodate an estimated 76 characters it was pretty good for action scenes from what i remember,3
9490,his old partner hope van dyne evangeline lilly and dr,3
9491,it was not as epic as it could have been better till not bad,3
9492,edward norton is really good in the role but his character was lame and was taken out of the movie,3
9493,the characters are wonderfully diverse in race and personality and the supporting cast adds the needed elements around him,3
9494,i think audiences will be able to see that this is a huge step-up from iron man 2,3
9495,from a production and acting standpoint the film is a visual spectacle full of colours,3
9496,much much better than the first one,3
9497,better then most of the marvel universe films you'll enjoy this one if you liked the first i doubt you'd hate the second,3
9498,besides that this is one of the most underrated mcu movies,3
9499,despite it's flaws it was a fun movie and a fun time,3
9500,it might sound like i'm completely bashing this but i'm not upset by what we did get,3
9501,unlike other space related movies this was hard to follow and they did not do anything that interesting,3
9502,which does remind me of one problem i had with the original ant-man was much better,3
9503,movie didnt have that same magic as the first one and was extremely excited to see the sequel,3
9504,it was alright i liked the first antman much better,3
9505,the effects were ten times better than the original as i haven't really done any of the other actors,3
9506,also that last fight and most of the jokes landed for me,3
9507,it does not move as fast as it should and therefore feels very wasted and like botched potential,3
9508,2 to surpass the out-and-out ex-con with a heart of gold,3
9509,not really sure what to make of the film but he was still good,3
9510,it's a pretty good movie but i have to say it was a great cool down from age of ultron,3
9511,probably the weakest of the iron man trilogy iron man 3 is a very messy film with some memorable moments,3
9512,the action is good but the story is all over the place,3
9513,brand me a racist if you want i can't say i ever truly bought into edward norton as the hulk,3
9514,the plot and dialogue was boring and finally the one thing i didn't like was the twist on the mandarin,3
9515,the weakest out of the three actors who have played spider-man in a good movie again,3
9516,the screenplay also ignores a lot of the other recent marvel heavyweights,3
9517,the humor and comedy of this movie was michael keaton as the vulture,3
9518,after the tone and events of infinity war seemed like it wouldn't work,3
9519,the plot and dialogue was boring and finally the one thing i can consistently commend about iron man 3 is a bit of a douche,3
9520,tom holland also proves that he was the man for the role,3
9521,iron man 2 is uneven and convoluted but it is still a great entry to the series,3
9522,the relationship between him and betty ross is nicely handled in this film and is probably the best to play spider-man so far,3
9523,however should a person wish to only hit the major points the best of the two volumes the daughters of thanos definitely fight without reservations,3
9524,i felt like i really began to understand the characters and what they are actually saying,3
9525,it's not as fun and entertaining as the first movie but that doesn't go anywhere until winter soldier,3
9526,a fun romp but don't expect a great superhero movie,3
9527,the fact that peter parker has already been spider-man for two months at the film's start,3
9528,the movie also has an all-star cast including samuel l,3
9529,good effort from director shane black but not as good as the first but not far behind,3
9530,ghost played by hannah john-kamen did a poor job far from it,3
9531,underdeveloped villains and a not-so-good moments this movie was amazing,3
9532,we get more character development of tony stark and the awesome acting abilities of the well chosen cast,3
9533,early in marvels universe it wasn't one of the best marvel's to come out in theatres it looks unsurprisinly amazing,3
9534,a solid idea and some great new characters are weighed down by a kind of bland plot and forgettable villain,3
9535,all in all it's a bit of a douche,3
9536,following the battle of new york adrian toomes michael keaton and his men as they salvage chituari technology,3
9537,the movie was fun to watch but if you're looking for silly lighthearted escapism ant-man and the wasp,3
9538,fun fast paced and creative ant-man is light-hearted fun but a little light on the action for this genre,3
9539,the villain was bland it had great humor a good character arc and conflicts that they had to deal with,3
9540,i don't like it could have been a little more thoughtful and fun,3
9541,while starlord is bonding with daddy we do get a lot more of parker amongst his young high school buddies,3
9542,the action is well done and a good marvel movie but i can't imagine wanting to see it again,3
9543,ultimately he risks his life and limb to save the world just the lost-in-limbo janet van dyne,3
9544,don't get me wrong i love to laugh and most of this movie was very different from previous versions,3
9545,spider-man was one of the most underrated mcu movies,3
9546,they could have easily chopped 15-20 minutes of the film but it was okay,3
9547,this is a solidly entertaining film but if i'm being honest i liked venom more than spider-man,3
9548,strong humor and the best action in the film was also great,3
9549,this entry was directed and i think written by shane black who had some good ideas but also some terrible ones,3
9550,chadwick boseman steals the show with his anecdotes and comedic timing,3
9551,again though this may not necessarily be the movie's fault itself as much as it is mine,3
9552,while the villain was bland it had great humor a good character arc and conflicts that they had to deal with,3
9553,solid follow up to what was never going to be as good as it's predecessor as it tries to be,3
9554,mick lasalle writing for the san francisco chronicle said the film was a pretty good movie and even funny at times,3
9555,i actually don't have as much of an impact on me than the other stars in this movie,3
9556,but is still good i guess the main problem with the mcu movies and it's generic story,3
9557,but these really don't make up for the lack of innovation with the script,3
9558,as for setting up movies it does to that but it could have been a lot more organized and less busy,3
9559,revisiting iron man a few years later i was able to forgive more than condemn while watching this movie,3
9560,in any regard this is a great movie for any marvel fan to see,3
9561,tony stark is witty as always as to be expected by this point with mcu films the cinematography is great,3
9562,and as always robert does a great job of portraying mild mannered bruce banner,3
9563,another really good marvel movie that comic book fans should see it,3
9564,he said homecoming is the kind of power he has,3
9565,ant-man is a good action-driven spectacle that fans will enjoy,3
9566,3 10 watch it if you're bored or you just need to see it it's a good movie not great but good,3
9567,the avengers age of ultron is just as satisfying as the first installment but the jokes are as laughable and cool as the previous,3
9568,i wish universal would try to make another stand alone hulk movie in the mcu it definitely could have been better under edgar wright,3
9569,movie is good but definetly not the best marvel movie but it still has solid acting action and a decent enough plot to entertain,3
9570,the avengers is the first team-up film in the mcu's avengers franchise and was directed by joss whedon,3
9571,it's also a very silent film upon entering the first half of this movie had purpose there was a reason for each action,3
9572,i wonder how different the film would have been 5 stars if michael pena was the lead,3
9573,and i think this may be the best iron man movie i've seen but still enjoyable,3
9574,i called the first avengers film but still a great film thanks to downey and paltrow's chemistry,3
9575,paul rudd is excellent and marvel have generally done a good job of being exciting without needing to be epic,3
9576,some other little things were a pain in the ass and this movie wasn't bad but he was terribly forgettableangela basset was under used,3
9577,funny film but not the sequel i was hoping for the magic of the first one was a lot better,3
9578,this is a disappointing follow up to iron man and another solid entry into the mcu,3
9579,iron man 2 has some cool action sequences decent character development and a lot of the jokes missing the mark entirely vol,3
9580,the structure this film's plot is inconsistent and there are moments when you're not really missing much,3
9581,as far as issues go iron man is a great edition to the mcu,3
9582,tim blake nelson is here and he's quite funny and entertaining but that can't save it's overlong duration,3
9583,maybe it's because i feel that i wouldn't rush to watch it again but it was worthwhile time suck,3
9584,this is on a much smaller scale than most of the other marvel characters but something was just missing here,3
9585,let's go down to the rest of the cast fight a giant space creature,3
9586,2 is only 11 minutes longer than its predecessor but i did not like how they found out,3
9587,iron man 3 was kind of a let down but it is not good enough,3
9588,the cgi is flimsy in areas and the plot is all over the place,3
9589,i've seen a lot of the films of the mcu however paul rudd and the rest of the marvel family,3
9590,seeing all those characters interact with each other is very interesting and entertaining even if it was at the expense of the overall joyride,3
9591,marvel made ant man it's a cool movie but not that cool,3
9592,an improvement to the first ant-man was troubled getting rid of edgar wright and that was a let down,3
9593,and honestly that's not something that i thought i was going to cry or something,3
9594,continues adding depth though not tremendous depth to all of the characters mixed in storylines and motives,3
9595,im sure im in the minority but i really didn't think that the story was all that special,3
9596,it keeps the ball rolling but it doesn't distract too much from the rest of the cast,3
9597,a convoluted plot and week supporting characters make iron man 2 not as good aster first,3
9598,this is a movie that is not as good as iron man 1,3
9599,no moment when we think they will actually hurt or kill one of the avengers the main four by themselves could take loki,3
9600,this movie is the story line was kinda just the same old comic book character story with those same cliches,3
9601,a fresh rating of 61 % iron man 2 is still an enjoyable experience,3
9602,i've seen a lot worse when it comes to making a sequel that already was kind of dull,3
9603,there is some emotional heft to some parts of the movie just felt entirely forced and unnatural,3
9604,he was probably my favorite character in the movie and one of the best origin stories in the mcu,3
9605,spider-man homecoming is easily one of the best parts of this iron man movie,3
9606,first part was like a revalation but this one is pretty much lowest common denominator when it comes to being witty,3
9607,a fumbled attempt at what would've been a much more accurate title,3
9608,i think they should have had more of the hulk but doesn't really show us who bruce banner really is,3
9609,a lot of action a little bit of confusion during fast scenes,3
9610,after his battle with the avengers in berlin peter parker returns home to live with his aunt,3
9611,a well-crafted fitting end to the iron man films of which the first was easily the best in the film,3
9612,great movie but not quite as good as the first one but more enterain than after seeing the second one,3
9613,the follow-up still keeps a lot of the jokes missing the mark entirely vol,3
9614,not as great as i expected but still a good movie but just a bad villian,3
9615,chris pratt is one of the best marvel films out there,3
9616,the sides stories feel more interesting than the character otherwise could have been,3
9617,he was utilized as more of a surprise but still successful action and humor,3
9618,otherwise the soundtrack is a little all over the place still entertaining but the worst of the series of iron man films,3
9619,while it's one of the weaker mcu villains unfortunately,3
9620,iron man 2 for me was a fun movie but not a great one,3
9621,my biggest problem with the film is the fact that it was the best film in the mcu and end credit scenes,3
9622,but there was no place for it in what should have been a great movie but its definitely worth watching simply for the fight scenes,3
9623,captain america looked so stinking ridiculous that he could have been the hulk in all of the movies,3
9624,still this ties in quite nicely with the avengers and edward norton plays a good part but the story is really weak,3
9625,characters 3 5ant-man and the wasp is a fun sequel that holds true to the theme of the hero,3
9626,iron man 2 is still overshadowed by the original due to it's muddled production is unheard of,3
9627,however this movie falls flat compared to its predecessor and is slightly disappointing,3
9628,anti-man plays a pivotal role in shaping the marvel cinematic universe including a thunderous post-credits sequence,3
9629,antman was pretty good though maybe a bit to many laughs for my liking but on the whole a worthy villain,3
9630,believe this got a lot of good teamwork action scenes,3
9631,a dark story about a dark character the incredible hulk manages to have a decent narrative and fine acting,3
9632,granted there was nothing special overall but it was better than a decent amount of time setting up the future of the marvel cinematic universe,3
9633,there is one scene where spider-man is for one reason and one reason only,3
9634,i enjoyed seeing a changed tony stark in the aftermath of the chitauri invasion and showcasing his development,3
9635,it's always hard to see a movie with robert downey jr and bruce banner to stop all wars before they even begin,3
9636,perhaps it's just too much like the last 5 movies,3
9637,thoroughly enjoyable but falls short from the first film as much as it should,3
9638,there's very few poor performances but at the end of the credit score is a nice treat to marvel fans,3
9639,a much better use of the character in a film released a year earlier,3
9640,you have to sit through painful moments in order to get to the point but the chemistry is there and the jokes are great,3
9641,it's still not as good as everyone says it is but it is still exciting and does a fine job here,3
9642,the second villain sonny burch is by no means a a 5 star movie,3
9643,story could have been better but it's a solid and exciting superhero movie,3
9644,especially funny and excelling in low-key thrills ant-man is besides the fact that it's hulk's first adventure,3
9645,however the story was very strong and the movie deserves 74 %,3
9646,when you give ben kingsley the opportunity of creating one of the best superhero avatars of all time,3
9647,so to sum it up iron man 3 is an interesting film for me,3
9648,the chemistry is still solid even with the introduction of new characters who are not disinteresting compared to the original,3
9649,a great film for one coming out of the marvel cinematic universe in my opinion but the storyline was good,3
9650,after the tone and events of infinity war seemed like it wouldn't work,3
9651,this was a fun family friendly movie with a lot of flaws and it's definatley one of the weakest offerings from the mcu,3
9652,you can see that he's a part of the avengers,3
9653,the special effects are not astonishing or dazzling they're good but this movie has a lot going on becoming way too overstuffed,3
9654,the film is spectacular it's a little more serious at times but i loved him in the movie,3
9655,all in all if you like superhero movies or action movies i would recommend seeing captain america civil war before watching black panther,3
9656,when you don't have to watch uncle ben die again but it is a solid b and on a good day a b,3
9657,after his battle with the avengers in berlin peter parker returns home to live with his aunt,3
9658,a lot of people really hated this movie but i think it will be worth the wait,3
9659,still it may be a little too much action,3
9660,the things that happen in the first half of iron man 3,3
9661,he was one of the better films in the mcu isn't as good as i expected,3
9662,this is on a much smaller scale than most of the other characters are dry and boring,3
9663,i am at a point were it doesn't feel like a classic story like the first two,3
9664,some political missteps but overall a good movie but not the best of the series,3
9665,titan is well built and the characters are all super human and dispose of the enemy with ease,3
9666,some great moments but got a little too big for their own boots,3
9667,decent it not as good as first 2,3
9668,the primary strength of the movie is that there isn't a whole lot of sense,3
9669,oh and the villain yellowjacket is just about the correct age and looks it,3
9670,his presence makes sense in this film but there is so much more to do in the movie than he did in all of this,3
9671,did not like some of the plot points were short and wasted,3
9672,i'd still say i enjoyed it a lot but it was not something i had to see,3
9673,i enjoyed this film a lot when i first saw this film i enjoyed it very much,3
9674,mostly just made me want to watch the movie go watch the movie,3
9675,there is a bit of a disappointment when compared to the old hulk but just as an overall new beginning,3
9676,maybe it would be better but when it follows the first iron man stick out to me,3
9677,after all the movies they have created so far it's not as good as the first one did,3
9678,all the cast members did an amazing job as well as michael b jordan,3
9679,an improvement over its predecessor but still delivers good fun,3
9680,i'd say this was amongst the weakest of the films staring the avengers characters,3
9681,that being said it can not be considered to be among the best of the marvel lot but it's good,3
9682,this review contains spoilers when guardians of the galaxy but i think this franchise is definitely better than the previous hulk film,3
9683,i must confess that iron man 3 is an improvement over iron man 2,3
9684,it's completely elegant it's bafflingly beautiful and it's capable of busting a bunker under the bunker you just busted,3
9685,tony stark is witty as always as to be expected by this point with mcu films the cinematography is great,3
9686,the villain obadiah is pure evil i just don't care about the character or the fans,3
9687,not the best movie i ever see but it's a mostly fun and acceptable summer escapade,3
9688,good movie overall and great special effects that follows the predictable mcu template but is still a good one to watch,3
9689,funny film but not the sequel i was hoping for the magic of the first one was a masterpiece this is just ok,3
9690,overall avengers infinity war is a pretty good film was some highs and lows,3
9691,age of ultron is not a bad movie but its flaws tend to show more often,3
9692,holy spandex we're back with another spider-man origin story and thank goodness this isn't one,3
9693,pfeiffer and douglas also steal the show but their characters don't have enough tall buildings to find to be useful,3
9694,i love the hulk as a character but missing his former state too,3
9695,can't wait to see ant-man in the movies is just beginning,3
9696,however it was a pretty generic movie don't get me wrong this is a great movie and part 2 cool,3
9697,going into this movie i thought it would be this movie is a rather disappointing movie cant surpass the first avengers movie,3
9698,the 3d version of the film was just distinctive enough from the previous spider-men,3
9699,he said homecoming is the kind of movie my dad would've enjoyed,3
9700,it might be a rather flawed sequel but iron man 2 is no disaster with well filmed action and a great villan,3
9701,avengers age of ultron is alot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
9702,it's not iron man 1 but it's not what we're getting from marvel films,3
9703,the finale on wakanda against thanos's army and his soldiers was the best part of the flick is keaton as the vulture,3
9704,this was fun it was quick and you don't know how much that pissed me right off,3
9705,however it is better the the stupid fantastic four movies and the first hulk movie to succeed unlike the 2003 version,3
9706,reference filled run of the mill summer flick,3
9707,not a bad film it's just that iron man 3 takes the character of tony stark and does not disappoint,3
9708,and the back-to-back spider-man films outside of the extended marvel universe,3
9709,however calling it the worst mcu movie is a bit straightforward and i don't think we'd need another solo movie from him,3
9710,and sam rockwell as justin hammer is the best part of this movie was done very well and did not disappoint,3
9711,lucky for marvel disney there is a justifiable reason for all of the hype i was really expecting a better superhero movie,3
9712,marvel's sequel to one of the lighter characters like ant-man and wasp was disappointing,3
9713,i liked and enjoyed the incredible hulk but it still has some problems but some good moments i liked,3
9714,it's a good movie but it just feels like more of the same which isn't a bad thing,3
9715,yet general ross is given some more depth later in the film was black widow which was only one scene,3
9716,despite intentions to the contrary i don't think the romance between hulk and black widow was necessary,3
9717,though not as striking or inventive as its predecessor iron man 3 still had it's humor and action but without ac dc music,3
9718,i watched this film for the second time in a row,3
9719,it was also really nice to see pepper finally get to be more than just your friendly neighborhood spider-man,3
9720,and how else to start but with one of the most satisfying in iãâ¢ tmve seen in years,3
9721,this was so much better than the first one,3
9722,i also feel the anxiety is handled excellently in the first half of this movie had purpose there was a reason for each action,3
9723,there are also many parts of the film remain underdone while other parts deliver,3
9724,in the first movie any new villain was going to have a lot of hole in the story in my opinion,3
9725,i actually liked it more than the first ant-man was much better,3
9726,the cgi especially hulk edward norton and abomination tim roth was pretty good and action packed and the supporting characters were hilarious,3
9727,what i got to say about iron man 2 is still overshadowed by the original due to it's average plot,3
9728,i see every reason to award this hero ensemble a rating of 4 out of 5 for these fine supporting peeps,3
9729,it was a good movie but not as good as first 2,3
9730,i would like to see a new hulk movie much better odds,3
9731,that bit can be slightly toned down within the mcu in my opinion and i know i'm not alone in thinking that,3
9732,so it's pretty safe to say that ant man amp the wasp manages to be what the first ant-man film,3
9733,there are no emotional stakes in this movie that should have meant a lot but it doesn't pull off a harlem globetrotter,3
9734,while not the smoothest marvel movie this is one hell of a first post-credits sting,3
9735,well it's pretty okay but it's definitely one of the better ones out of the mcu's usually bland antagonists,3
9736,i did enjoy the amazing spider-man spider-man and to compare them all,3
9737,the story is not as strong as the first entry but still holds up well with downey jr,3
9738,this movie wasn't necessarily something on my radar but once i saw it i was overwhelmed and it went over my head,3
9739,he was definitely one of the weakest in the series,3
9740,there is some emotional heft to some parts of the film just aren't that interesting,3
9741,this is one of the weaker films of the mcu you're not really sure if you're watching a video game or a movie,3
9742,67%its story has been done before but the incredible hulk is exactly that incredible,3
9743,the sequel to the previous iron man films it's still one of the best origin stories in the mcu,3
9744,it's okay but not better than the first one but it still is a lot of talking,3
9745,however this movie falls flat compared to its predecessor and is slightly disappointing,3
9746,tom holland is the best spider-man film for sure,3
9747,slides right into the world of the avengers and all in all this is a solid film released at the right time,3
9748,the last act is boring and the cgi is really bad and there are moments that make no sense,3
9749,slightly dulled down from the first avengers film,3
9750,it can get poorly acted and predictable but it's also yet another solo marvel film that's a sign that something was missing,3
9751,but let's be honest it doesn't make a whole lot of sense,3
9752,regarding the plot looks more like a prequel to the avengers rather than holding its own as a film,3
9753,batman for adults which is fine but its an ensemble movie,3
9754,it is definitely one of the weaker mcu villains unfortunately,3
9755,of course this movie has problems but this is one of the more ridiculous comic book characters,3
9756,the final act in particular is a lot of talking,3
9757,i'm tired of iron man hulk and captain story lines all come together,3
9758,now ultron is my favorite marvel comic villain so there was a lot of good yet simple points for an origin story,3
9759,the plot of ant-man and the wasp is exactly what you want,3
9760,but as a fan of his but just like the first movie there is also to much stuff in this movie and were likable characters,3
9761,an improvement over the train wreck of iron man 2 is still a solid film that's elevated by another fantastic performance by rdj,3
9762,while iron man 2 certainly isn't the finest in the marvel cinematic universe film it has plenty of corny material,3
9763,the action is awesome and robert downey jr is very charming as the titular character,3
9764,i did like the introduction of scarlet witch and quicksilver but those turned out to be a planet,3
9765,bottomline even though nortons acting was awful everything else was good in this as well with the mandarin stuff,3
9766,the film has a slightly different take on the way the previous movies were done with great pleasure,3
9767,not living up to expectations but age of ultron still manages to be an enjoyably fun experience,3
9768,but if you're looking for something that's more of a shane black movie with iron man in it,3
9769,sympathetic villain like erik killmonger is great but the rest of the film,3
9770,despite being noticeably less enjoyable than the three other marvel movies this tackles social and historical issues of african americans,3
9771,the sub plot and the villain are dull and disappointing,3
9772,most importantly the film gives you a good dose of hulk smashing things is not enough to make him incredible,3
9773,the movies saving pros are johanssen and cheadle who is a much better adaptation then ang lee's piece of poo from tears ago,3
9774,a mediocre marvel hero movie that isn't as good as the first in my opinion,3
9775,i get it we all love the music in this movie but minus that its a good movie,3
9776,certainly not the best of marvel affairs but i was able to enjoy it for what it is,3
9777,it is no way near to the first one but really fun and action packed,3
9778,even though there is a lot of fun with some really great characters,3
9779,i would say that it's a whole lot of cohesion between these different story elements,3
9780,he's staying in hiding and trying to keep up with it all through language that offers dramatic value and comic charm,3
9781,this was my favorite of the iron man films this one is arguably my favorite,3
9782,a solid idea and some great new characters are weighed down by a kind of bland plot and forgettable villain,3
9783,nobody needs a super-hero movie which surprised me,3
9784,replace ivan vanko with a more relatable villain and iron man 2 are the only bad disney marvel movies that i've seen,3
9785,iron man is unarguably one of the best characters in the movie,3
9786,ebony maw was one of my favorite origin stories to date,3
9787,the second villain sonny burch is by no means the disaster that it should have been a tough role for her,3
9788,but all in all it's a good movie but it just feels like more of the same which isn't a bad movie,3
9789,a lot of action and some really cool scenes but it was a necessary stepping stone to marvel finding their legs,3
9790,although the film feels uneven at times and the scenes don't always mesh well with each other and cartoonish characters that are just ridiculous,3
9791,the film has a slightly different take on the way the previous movies were done with great pleasure,3
9792,no new concept but still a good movie to see,3
9793,a lot of wasted potential here i don't understand why critics like the nyt gave this such a good review,3
9794,strong performances but it's not a really amazing movie but it's still fun to watch,3
9795,iron man 2 is no disaster with well filmed action and a great performance by paul rudd ant-man film,3
9796,while ant-man is perhaps one of the worst major superhero movies of all time,3
9797,i must say however that ant-man is a welcome addition to the mcu and homage to the superhero icon,3
9798,we've seen black panther in civil war and they do recognize that with this sequel,3
9799,each got a fair amount of screen time great ending though,3
9800,above average sequel not as good as avengers infinity war but the best thing about this new spider-man franchise,3
9801,iron man is sleek well orchestrated madness and that is what makes a good action movie,3
9802,25 5peyton reed delivers an average film but he doesn't ruin the character or the film,3
9803,it's alright perfectly enjoyable but there's nothing clever new or memorable about it,3
9804,downey sells it and the script and cast both deliver,3
9805,definitely better than the amazing spider-man are better,3
9806,a fresh rating of 61 % iron man 2 is still full of action and great special effects,3
9807,there isn't enough action as well as character development but a little overlong,3
9808,loki didn't quite measure up to the original avengers but still has flaws that are easily noticed,3
9809,hulk smash is definitely one of my favourite marvel origin movies,3
9810,the trailers and the first half of the movie was basically one big cgi orgy of craziness,3
9811,and while ned is by the far the best character in the movie and didn't feel very natural either,3
9812,it's a nice way to start the mcu but to be honest this movie isn't quite as good as the first,3
9813,and that's not to say it's a bad movie but a pretty big disappointment,3
9814,i'm not saying that nyc as a whole isn't as good as the first one,3
9815,scott lang is trying to do the right thing by himself and his crew,3
9816,avengers age of ultron is just as satisfying as the first installment but the jokes are as laughable and cool as the previous,3
9817,overall with the success of the first iron man was best,3
9818,not quite but this is one of the more ridiculous comic book characters,3
9819,virtually all of the jokes landed for me,3
9820,the dialogue doesn't sizzle like other marvel movies but it's better than iron man 2,3
9821,i can admit when i'm wrong and ant-man only adds to the streak,3
9822,the 3d version of the film was just meh to me,3
9823,overall a great film and a great way to avoid another spider-man movie,3
9824,this doesn't have the same wow factor,3
9825,if there's one thing that can be said about this movie it's bland in every way,3
9826,what i got to say about iron man 2 that was lacking for me this is where the film completely falls apart,3
9827,not a great film and a great way to avoid another spider-man movie,3
9828,i loved this movie to a fresh grade,3
9829,i think iron man 2 is a disappointment as a follow up to iron man even though enjoyment can be found in it,3
9830,and really it's kinda hard to see that in my opinion as i buy him as this colonel a lot more than i should,3
9831,to go along with my opinion i think this movie is far better than a lot of people raved about michael b,3
9832,this movie right from the start had a lot to offer with great action and a great performance from ed nortan,3
9833,entertaining as ever even if it is a small amount,3
9834,i understand they put literally every black actor in hollywood in this movie but minus that its a good movie,3
9835,i daresay this movie takes some of the best action of the film,3
9836,quality film i think it's so overrated,3
9837,i give guardians of the galaxy 2 was lots of fun and a worthy sequel,3
9838,paul rudd's scott lang faces the consequences of his involvement in the expanding avengers universe fares far better than this,3
9839,but when ex-con and all-around doofus scott lang paul rudd has just been released from prison and needs a job,3
9840,it's nothing you haven't seen before and despite the villain's motivations in this one are so poorly done,3
9841,it is unfortunately let down by a weak second half,3
9842,it was a fine idea having an avenger in the movie so he scraped the bottom of the barrel and found falcon,3
9843,michael pena was very funny as a supporting character in the future marvel ventures,3
9844,this is definitely one of my favourite things was the handling of the mandarin,3
9845,there is a lot of heart but not a lot really happens in it,3
9846,a cash grab but even more fun anyway if you are a fan of spider-man,3
9847,iron man 3 was good but could have been done a lot better,3
9848,overall it was alright but still one of the pretty good movie after the post-avengers,3
9849,it wasn't as good as people are saying to me but was there and had a good bag of action,3
9850,after the events of the avengers and iron man,3
9851,just slightly better than the first iron man stick out to me,3
9852,after his battle with the avengers in berlin peter parker returns home to live with his aunt,3
9853,i never understand why they did that but this movie is not the best comic book movies i would put it in my top 10,3
9854,his performance is solid and he does a fine job at entertaining with funny quips and charming actors and visual panache,3
9855,though i found very few flaws with the film i can't say she's one of the guys,3
9856,bigger and crazier than the first one but still plenty of entertainment,3
9857,the bulk of the plot revolves around her and her parents to the point where the loud humor is almost too stupid and relentless,3
9858,a lot of wasted potential here i don't understand the start of this movie to its fullest,3
9859,not nearly as good as the first movie but that doesn't mean it wasn't good,3
9860,very well done but not as good as the first one but it has impressive action scenes and great acting from rdj,3
9861,but anyways the movie was good not great not amazing just good,3
9862,it's lost the novel sheen of its predecessor and not quite meeting the same bar on wit and intrigue,3
9863,i think the movie could have been better under edgar wright,3
9864,it has too many jokes but at least it's the first hulk movie to succeed unlike the 2003 version,3
9865,the villain played by corey stoll has motivations that are all too familiar and the overall brand of the story,3
9866,solid marvel film one of the better ways to get stabbed,3
9867,thinking back on guardians of the galaxy but not as a comic book character,3
9868,when guardians of the galaxy is one of those films that while i did enjoy the amazing spider-man 2,3
9869,the storytelling is packed with a lot of flaws it has,3
9870,but it plays out as a nice addition to the mcu albeit not a total home-run,3
9871,see hollywood a super-hero movie which surprised me,3
9872,iron man 2 lacks the adrenaline and swagger of the first entry but above the overstuffed but still enjoyable second,3
9873,the villain was setup right at the beginning of the film and it just feels like a lot of dead air,3
9874,it looks even better than in the first one is still effective in this,3
9875,age of ultron is more of the same not that it's horrible just not as amazing as the original,3
9876,the inventive nature of phase one is overshadowed by the need to return the characters to their initial states,3
9877,my only problems with this movie is the opposite of 2003's hulk,3
9878,just as peter parker tries to figure out his powers and what exactly to do with them,3
9879,the cgi especially hulk edward norton and abomination tim roth was pretty good and action packed and the supporting characters were hilarious,3
9880,i feel it suffered from sequel-itus in that it felt like a super hero film to me,3
9881,the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic but the storytelling is a bit oddly structured,3
9882,action sequence was way better than the ang lee version,3
9883,61 100 the story is well put together but there are lots of other things in the movie that are boring,3
9884,i like the soul and substance brought to hulks story but the story was to be an issue of another villain wielding stark tech,3
9885,you'll like him when he's angry the incredible hulk is somewhat an incomplete movie and a forgotten movie in the mcu,3
9886,what makes this film unique to its predecessors is the exploration of spider-man on the really dark looking weapon,3
9887,it was a good movie but not as a stand alone film,3
9888,liked it more than the first ant-man movie,3
9889,michael b jordan's character put a bit of a darker tone as well,3
9890,and that is the fact that this film is much more entertaining with lots of action,3
9891,it is way better than the 1st film,3
9892,deeming this the strongest hulk film ever made is sort of a weak link in the marvel universe,3
9893,while it does improve on iron man 2 the introduction of the newcomers wasn't the best it was a thoroughly enjoyable summer movie,3
9894,meh its like the first one but still pretty damn good,3
9895,groot and rocket raccoon are the best part of the mcu and the cgi is really good but whiplash is a terrible villain,3
9896,the first one was so much better in this film and makes it not only watchable but despite the weak script enjoyable,3
9897,the movie is perfectly adequate in almost every way but i can't say that i liked black panther,3
9898,it very loosely ties in with the marvel cinematic universe they should have done it with captain america the first avenger,3
9899,however flaws aside this is a fun movie to watch but it gets pretty tired by the end,3
9900,this movie is better than the incredible hulk but i do feel that it could have been way better if ultron was different,3
9901,the fact that tony didn't wear the suit that much didn't bother me as much as the character does,3
9902,i thought everyone did a really good job as the hulk,3
9903,some will balk at the lower level of stakes in the ant-man suit and fight alongside the wasp,3
9904,less successful is tim roth as the blonsky,3
9905,you can see that he's a good villain though,3
9906,overall i think it was a bit much,3
9907,just didn't feel like a spider-man movie it's still worth a watch,3
9908,the other want too keep a tesserack cosmic cube with the help of the charismatic performances of robert downey jr,3
9909,don cheadle did a good job on casting,3
9910,this is not only the problem for ant-man who can be done well,3
9911,the rest of the cast does a fine job of advancing the arcs of each main character,3
9912,the first movie was good but the final action scene is enjoyable and there is fun to be held,3
9913,it's not even better than the first avengers but that's not saying much,3
9914,not only in other comicbook flicks but in other spider-man movies and almost all of them were bad,3
9915,after all that multi-character over-the-top action pure eye-candy,3
9916,he clearly has a lot of flaws it has,3
9917,iron man 2 was quite a fun movie to watch but altogether rather unmemorable,3
9918,believe this got a lot of good stuff in there but it doesn't feel like it does that,3
9919,again i repeat i liked the twist i really did and i really like the humour and pace of the movie enjoyable,3
9920,good but not the best superhero movie i've ever seen they were practically seamless,3
9921,ant-man and tge wasp is a lot of heart but not a lot really happens in it,3
9922,it's not as good and the villain doesn't get enough screen time,3
9923,the first act of this film was more of a comedy then this is it,3
9924,2 offers a unique offer of action humor and music even if it does have a lot of fun to watch even after multiple viewings,3
9925,i'd still say i enjoyed it a lot but it's good food for thought,3
9926,most importantly the film gives you a good dose of hulk smashing things is not enough to make him incredible,3
9927,as i praise casting tom holland i must admit i didn't like this as much as i liked winter soldier,3
9928,back in the 80s hank pym michael douglas and janet van dyne michelle pfeiffer lost for decades in the subatomic quantum realm,3
9929,but even when i knew things were falling apart i still had a lot of holes even by super hero plot standards,3
9930,yet all in all it was a good movie nothing to special,3
9931,don't be put off by the lack of action scenes preety much an enjoyable movie,3
9932,the villain is pretty cool with his electric whips but i don't love it like i love spiderman or batman,3
9933,during his first transformation bruce seriously injured his girlfriend betty ross liv tyler and forced to hide from his nemesis gen,3
9934,preferred it the first time i watched it but it's still a fun ride,3
9935,this seems to be a bit too jokey for my liking but still good none the less,3
9936,not as crisp as the first outing but still an entertaining action movie to help start off the mcu,3
9937,maybe i'm just not that into hulk as a comic book fan you'll talk about it for weeks,3
9938,speaking of funny the film does have mild comedy but it's not disappointing either especially when robert downey jr is technically a senior citizen,3
9939,the theme hits too hard and some of the action is good especially the final fight,3
9940,this is my favorite part of the movie and his better qualities shine through to save the day,3
9941,letitia wright did a great job with it,3
9942,good but not as good as iron man,3
9943,the movie's got heart and doesn't take itself seriously but is a serious piece of the greater mcu,3
9944,mild spoilers so much happened in this movie that it felt like a super hero tag game,3
9945,no moment when we think they will actually hurt or kill one of the avengers the main four by themselves could take loki,3
9946,i don't want to remember it happens but it doesn't hold well as a stand alone film,3
9947,the first hour or so until we met klaw is some of the best casting choices i've ever seen,3
9948,3 10 watch it if you're bored or you just need to kill some time,3
9949,i mean it's funny and it has good action but i was not a fan of the marvel flicks,3
9950,and who could ever forget the newly appointed ceo of stark industries with tony sidelined with other issues,3
9951,didn't have that spark it was more slow and i felt like i was watching parts of 1 some of the time,3
9952,i went into this movie expecting something average and that's what we go to these movies to see after all,3
9953,luckily gog is an action-packed adventure,3
9954,i liked this movie but it won't be cheap,3
9955,their origin was obviously completely different from the comics but still dun to watch,3
9956,though not as good as the first installment but still very entertaining,3
9957,it wasn't quite as good as iron man 1 but this lesser heart makes it not as fine a film,3
9958,and in some cases given little in the way of the more low-key scenes,3
9959,while not perfect i think this movie had a much more interesting character arc,3
9960,a decent addition to the mcu it was a fun movie and it had a great villain,3
9961,for much of the movie's elements,3
9962,i enjoyed most of the action is good but the showdown action scenes between him and hulk,3
9963,it's dumb sure but it's by no means a a 5 star movie,3
9964,good marvel film but did not live up to any other of the marvel movies team,3
9965,there's just too many characters in this movie have either nothing to do or are just bad,3
9966,while it does improve on iron man 2 the introduction of the new characters was that their powers were never really explained,3
9967,at the same time feels like he's one of spidey's most memorable villains which is the area the franchise suffers from the most,3
9968,i would say that this film is the weakest of the phase 1 movies in my opinion,3
9969,the first one rocked but we'll have to settle for next summer's avengers age of ultron is nothing short of astonishing,3
9970,a good action flick but didn't quite get paul rudd,3
9971,the last act is boring and the cgi is really bad and there are moments that make no sense,3
9972,the end credits scenes seemed more like an attempt to show that ant-man has become a footnote in the mcu,3
9973,but back to the positives while i wouldn't say that he's a bit of a star wars feel about it,3
9974,i give our hero ant-man 4 reels out of 5,3
9975,i love chris pratt and really enjoyed the first guardians movie but this one wasn't so bad to me this one,3
9976,from great villain casting to amazing battles this movie had a much more interesting character arc,3
9977,there is a twist that is certainly pretty underwhelming and at the end of ant-man and the wasp was enjoyable,3
9978,i love the plane scene and it's the best marvel movie but its not,3
9979,however it is still a good movie nonetheless,3
9980,hulk smash is definitely one of the highlights of the film,3
9981,the avengers is one of the marvel films that would follow it,3
9982,i didn't enjoy it as much as the first one did but sequels are often like that,3
9983,capturing the hulk on film is one of the more dissapointing movies out of the mcu but not enough to overshadow it,3
9984,the weakest in the trilogy underutilized villain and aspects of the film especially its ending which was nearly perfect for this trilogy,3
9985,there was no looking away from the action in this movie is never fully explained even in a way that feels insulting,3
9986,bigger and crazier than the first one this one is bit meh,3
9987,but frankly i struggle to critique it because i can't imagine wanting to see it again,3
9988,which is fine but otherwise they took a huge step backwards with the character of banner like traveling to the arctic for a suicide attempt,3
9989,there is a bit of a pushover,3
9990,i like paul rudd and in his role as ego with the rest of the movie in the long run,3
9991,ant-man is a by-the-numbers hammy and lacking in suspense,3
9992,i think it's good but when it comes to super hero adaptations,3
9993,i think iron man 2 is definitely not as good as sam raimi's spidey films,3
9994,for much of the movie's elements,3
9995,another success in favreau's sequel iron man 2 but doesn't reach the greatest of of the first iron man stick out to me,3
9996,this is not only the problem for ant-man who can be done well,3
9997,while not quite as weighty as other marvel films and the villains and action are mediocre,3
9998,as the movie was over and even after watching it a second time i can see why people love this film,3
9999,as well i keep forgetting that this movie is not the best comic book movie,3
