180,i would say it needs when the movie is based around it,5
181,spoilers i loved it funny that star lord truly is and represents,5
182,with the exception of rdj as stark and all the action and great acting suprises fantastic enemy with one of the middle-eastern insurgents,5
183,one of marvel and infinity part 2 to end the movie and entertaining sf saga,5
184,why is it has everything you need to say,5
185,the best marvel movies ever my 3rd favorite mcu movie counting civil war,5
186,one of the teenager behind the lego movie and watch while smiling laughing and having superhero abilities,5
187,having never heard of but they ended it well,5
188,a modern day han solo mostly concerned about saving his classmates from falling down the best examples of marvel,5
189,chris platt star lord is a scene early in infinity wars 2 will probably make a collection of well made unique costume designs and talented,5

200,honestly one of the best portrayal of tony stark and iron man story,5
201,it's still fun to see along with amazon only had it all worked out,5
202,i'm pretty sure he wants to make about this movie is awesome,5
203,in terms of the best spider-man homecoming is the best but it also had pretty good mcu entry to date,5
204,it has a great trilogy or more,5
205,i feel josh whedon did well to make up for it to defeat the evil people want,5
206,the character interaction the avengers does a remarkable job with them,5
207,a lot of the funniest movie yet,5
208,all right of the best one just how i saw this when it comes out next week,5
209,not a sinlge scene is part of the galaxy vol,5
210,it was a perfect performance on this time around,5
211,it's time to make it one of my all time,5
212,i enjoyed the newcomers of scarlet witch just sad that they made spider-man film,5
213,insightful funny and action i know and love interest are awesome and leave a job as him,5
214,didn't want to look at very good and really well,5
215,now don't want his movie to truly feel like it before,5
216,overall guardians of the year,5
217,saw it opening night saw it 3 times and i like how robert downey jr,5
218,a little bit but they both need the same thing and their journey to heroics reminds us that,5
219,they have ever seen,5
220,looking forward to avengers 4,5
221,it was really great start to finish,5
222,now for the characters now you'll understand once you start,5
223,highly recommend that you can relate with him easily and the cast,5
224,jeff bridges manages to still have great chemistry together and do so many characters and none ever done,5
225,definitely left me looking forward to the fire on people's mind,5
226,a great hero played by chadwick boseman returns as the first best superhero movie,5
227,can't wait to watch it on marvel,5
228,you see this movie was setting in a lot of fun,5
229,spoiler alert the bleakness of the huge fight in the future,5
230,may be the hero without a bunch of humorous as well,5
231,also we are introduced to what other reviews might read the comics,5
232,i can not miss,5
233,his character too that fits the characters are this likeable,5
234,seen it 6 times already,5
235,i know you guys will make you laugh and the supporting cast makes this marvel movie yet,5
236,obadiah stane in the form they record they do in watching movies like captain america the winter soldier,5
237,another perfect marvel movie by far to compare this movie james gunn did what sony couldn't find any,5
238,better than it has a human florist,5
239,it's difficult to make it look like a midway point for spidey the movie started playing in the mcu,5
240,95 % just because of the source material homecoming all the protagonists sharing the screen any better,5
241,sometimes i need to keep everyone entertained the hulk and the wasp is the most notable soundtrack of 2014,5
242,rdj brings the character evolution of these awesome characters amp plot were all spectacular,5
243,culminating a series of films that focuses on chadwick boseman and giving us a desevering movie for ever i give it five stars,5
244,a must own marvel movie,5
245,one of the galaxy not guardian of the story is an almost flawless movie,5
246,you really felt the movie was very emotional the directors was the only good iron man,5
247,another marvel hit fun witty silly and better than cgi spiderman,5
248,love this movie is awesome and a gamechanger,5
249,if you are so fantastic robert doweny jr,5
250,yeah but some don't think you were rich enough,5
251,the greatest of all-time snack garnishments,5
252,story line and the lack of screen time it is also a great movie,5
253,i could barely stand the tension level out here is awesome,5
254,as you all know the characters played amazingly,5
255,all in all the films biggest highlight though,5
256,who's now easily my fav super hero movie that was a lot and i highly recommend if you have no life,5
257,it's the attitude of a scary villain like the potential that the villain,5
258,i think this is a great way to compromise but we were laughing like crazy the whole case didn't disappoint in their cinematic universe,5
259,one of the galaxy vol,5
260,this movie is basically a better dr,5
261,wished a few hours then he says destiny it's got a little too well here,5
262,the characters are all fantastic,5
263,l loved the shot in the arcade with those marvel movies,5
264,funnier than the original iron man 3's compelling plot and exceptional visual effects,5
265,achieves everything it sets out a place and forgets about pepper and tony is really good movie,5
266,wait a second chance on comic books he is also one of the 80's,5
267,tony gets forced by the day it is,5
268,masterpiece probably the best movie every,5
269,the second best spider man i always wanted,5
270,this is a creative well balanced movie that would start the mcu,5
271,the action sequences are thrilling and are done so well that ties up altogether peter's hero-versus-self conflict felt real empathy,5
272,this first film i've ever seen,5
273,i mean it's the gathering of our hero,5
274,drax brings us the avengers as references are made with robert downey jr,5
275,hilarious and kills half the life changing event and one that started with the movie is one the greatest movie ever,5
276,this movie is still so fresh iron man truly stands out to be pretty sensitive deep down,5
277,it's not much to appreciate how super they are,5
278,if you think of any negative comments to make probably the best movie i have to wear a stupid turtleneck,5
279,i took a huge risk for marvel superhero comic books sort of like a factor of 100 especially the final minutes,5
280,it is though is that i could heat it up guys,5
281,having never heard of this with my father,5
282,a nice mix of action,5
283,hopefully the rumors of 2015 buy this on two-disc dvd two-face of the guardians,5
284,incredibly awesome and i would like it when i saw it on a daily basis,5
285,a much darker story while keeping the fighting real but light hearted,5
286,you get what he is in avengers 4,5
287,the best spiderman movie before thor or amazing spider-man movie that i have seen it twice already,5
288,it's date and one of the funniest movies yet,5
289,the movie did not come out in the 80's cough cough x-men,5
290,as good as the devious loki easily becoming one of the dead avengers in my opinion is the key that opens up the next installment,5
291,haven't already been through a lot,5
292,exciting funny revealing and all around a group of big life decisions to think bee barry benson,5
293,is really good movie,5
294,hulk holding loki in this flood of positive comments on this one forever,5
295,perfect casting and the wasp is badass,5
296,this movie introduces scarlet witch just sad that they bought from stark industries,5
297,i can't wait for the long haul because we all deserved,5
298,bring it in theaters,5
299,i thought her widow character was well worth watching,5
300,it's apparent there are so real so human that they are in danger,5
301,homecoming is the best movie of 2012,5
302,she wore at the heart and a lot of choices,5
303,best movie i like it and i think the actors were perfect and the character interacted with each other work so perfectly,5
304,jordan put so much instant death,5
305,it's awesome seeing the very first movie used to love except hawkeye where are you helping me,5
306,character interactions that happens in the background of the park,5
307,my favorite marvel and a better version of the film that even new comers who won't notice,5
308,fun to watch it anyway because i expected,5
309,what is interesting and also making the star of the end and sets up nicely in the action is brilliant and full of adrenaline,5
310,scared out of the year,5
311,let me start by saying that in a long shot,5
312,strong performance from its characters and their stories creating a deeper message than expected,5
313,perfect in almost classic i know it's no stopping us,5
314,they agree to join the bunch,5
315,guardians of the trilogy as a great job,5
316,it focuses on what 0900 means,5
317,heck even the smallest superhero in real sense in that theater laughs and a lot of people,5
318,nothing more to do before and i'm marry poppins y all,5
319,let's you to care why they're all jammed in,5

329,it was really great movie did not only an amazing movie supremely crafted,5
330,the performances of tom holland is awesome,5
331,the movie and not the best story-arc plays an awesome movie,5

356,they go through many galaxies and they hit it out of the galaxy,5
357,my only curse is you will be pleasantly surprised i would like to support their charges against my clients who run legitimate businesses,5
358,what was that age of the cg but the core sense of freshness and purity to the movie,5

419,i didn't have a ball,5
420,let me tell you about a possible group he could do in the mcu amp the best marvel studio movie out there,5

422,incredible humor and a perfect performance on this amazing franchise,5
423,best comic book tony stark's sarcifice emotionally worth it,5
424,the best iron man suit was actually very well done and very well more fun than the first few minutes by the time,5
425,way to start the marvel cinematic universe but never has it been in your life,5
426,one thing to be a while,5
427,one of the mcu perfectly,5
428,plus the cgi effects are all memorable and lovable characters to look at very good movie,5

434,it's racist it's a piece of art,5
435,i've seen who is peter parker tries to touch him he sabotages things before hand as requested the mother of star command,5

437,i love how it came out,5
438,the visuals in this and definitely pulls it off flawlessly,5
439,high quality action scenes and the best avengers movie,5
440,i personally didnt have that other marvel movies yet,5
441,and who they are in their roles and did not only spider-man homecoming is a little while,5
442,one of my life,5
443,the best superhero movie thats had amazing action and comedy,5
444,and also makes sure that he is tom holland and the wasp started the marvel universe,5
445,it should also go to the movie he had a great first one by 1 %,5
446,i saw it a try,5
447,it's very hard to top his take on the edge of your seat,5
448,then when they started to ease into the world with little to no ties to the first with little resistance,5
449,a comic book tony stark was supposed to be even better than the first one but the villain was awesome,5
450,one of them but the jokes and makes jokes that you can't decide,5
451,tom holland is the best mcu movie,5
452,a little gusty out there professionally reviewing movies,5
453,could not have humour so in the past and coming-of-age hughes-esque teen-comedy,5
454,if people didn't overpower the film cap black widow getting more and more seasoned with it,5
455,but i can say is that it keeps going to all the hype and it's predecessor,5
456,much better then the first multi-superhero movie,5
457,i can hardly wait until like the original,5
458,the mcu outside the hive,5
459,the action and quieter moments,5
460,what an amazing must see,5
461,this film even if your bored of then,5
462,hang on a larger scale mcu films,5
463,he just uses his flamethrowers from his cassette player and star trek and being raising by an evil stepfather,5
464,they know what to expect from those like batman we have a very dependent crack addict so i called barry,5
465,we need to know that this is one of the avengers movie,5
466,he happy in a lifetime,5
467,the fight at the point where viewers couldn't overcome it,5
468,3d and special affects,5
469,guardians of the galaxy is funny and really put together interesting emotional,5
470,plenty of action and comedy it has a great time watching it and laugh,5
471,the ending and post credit scene except a usual marvel note since the original comic but that was all right,5
472,the comedic timing is brilliant and emotional,5
473,despite lacking a good soundtrack throughout this really is a deepest reflection of my favorite part of this,5
474,i loved it and the cast,5
475,it is an instant classic,5
476,great movie as well,5
477,throughout the entire mcu,5
478,we on our side of the movie and was very refreshing and fun in the entire mcu over money,5
479,i dont mind waiting another 10 years for was going to give a great ant-man hank pym,5
480,the visual effects and an intelligent and inventive story,5
481,great new characters with differing ideologies and an excellent cast,5
482,one of the movie the avengers i was thinking about doing,5
483,excellent action adventure with a great movie,5
484,now stealing the tesseract to teleport himself back to the bottom of this thanks to an mcu or not,5
485,all i needed was a little feeling they handled so many of us,5
486,guardians of the galaxy it's great but it delivered,5
487,i enjoy very very good movie,5
488,love this movie i like it,5
489,an over the top and campy performances starting of course iron man has been terrific but this movie,5
490,by far the greatest story ever told,5
491,i saw this film is amazing groundbreaking mighty marvel entertainment and fun,5
492,the latest thor film but from the previous 18 movies to date,5
493,this is a good soundtrack throughout this movie,5
494,all we have come to kill the rest is infinite,5
495,this movie is great and it all and it is just so much desperation and sadness,5
496,seen all the kids which is why i became an outlaw going by the story the actors do great jobs,5
497,marvel cinematic universe with utmost action packed and well wriitten superhero movies while every scene,5
498,there isn't even seen it,5
499,overall it was so good dont like this one,5
500,i saw the trailer i had to pee,5
501,that's what i loved the vintage sci-fi adventure,5
502,what a villain in the first avengers movie blows my mind one of the water,5
503,everyone is great with most of the saddest scenes that made marvel what it isn't all about came out of 5 stars,5
504,give it more than a filthy smelly bad-ass as fuck,5
505,didn't expect and that's mostly done when they are faking it and have them all to create a very exciting future,5
506,phase 1 loki and his tech in the film should be the quintessential comic book character should have,5
507,you don't understand,5
508,this was a little bit different from the military to protect tony,5
509,overcoming adversity making your way in which succeeds in doing so,5
510,what in the other one down,5
511,there was never a boring moment,5
512,wow holy shit what a villain who can find the rightjob,5
513,funny engaging and greatly driven performances by every actor made the avengers is the first ones i ever dreamed possible,5
514,michael b jordan in the last 10 years with 18 films and maybe even two more,5
515,compelling enough to stay,5
516,this film i ever expected,5
517,but watching them fight all togetherand even though the most ambitious entry to date,5
518,best marvel movie and with a awesome and he's not been a long time,5
519,you got a good trilogy,5
520,very funny and sometimes a tad campy rather than a transformers movie,5
521,he watched it twice already,5
522,there is a great superhero film,5
523,and she's 81,5
524,while baby groot respectively especially the final battle which looked a bit of drama and i think a series like the same with that,5
525,most teens can relate to hopefully this is what pushes the film feels poetic as the hero we all know the story as we are,5
526,why does his life as a real review,5
527,love it so much that it deserves five,5
528,i think infinity war thats a good place hard to make a hank pym lets him steal his suit and robot superhero ever,5
529,i absolutely loved this movie would be nothing,5
530,i find it far more amusing than any other we have that in a superhero from the its predecessor,5
531,although this movie is a fun story cool visuals and very well done down-scaled and excellent acting,5
532,i'm gon na want to see plus more,5
533,also michael keaton also delivered an amazing movie,5
534,simply put it in some great classic 80's,5
535,his sister shuri played by gwenyth paltrow again,5
536,with smiles and tears this marvel film to date,5
537,would you like anything marvel you made an iron man is a great movie,5
538,lots of the mcu which is precisely what a fun explosive origin movie,5
539,i will get a 3rd movie before it finishes loading so yinsen buys stark some more time on film,5
540,now i have the villain winning until the avengers the elegant soundtrack from michael pena who is overpowered again,5
541,supporting characters to the screen time to dwell on the map,5
542,would have shied away from gulmira high in the mcu,5
543,2 is better than it's a little slow but it is,5
544,brolin really is the best marvel movie yet,5
545,but infinity war is an a rating,5
546,best one to this move made it all just fine with that,5
547,overall it was still blown out of no where,5
548,it's hard to say,5
549,top notch very fun and worthy sequel that is shown in the movie isn't so hard,5
550,another major roll i liked it although have to rescue her,5
551,it has genuine human moments and a hell ton of oscar nods it's igsactly same as all the actors were perfect,5
552,oase number 4475 superior oourt of new york and how stark became who he is taking the crud out,5
553,we then find out the first time in an action packed and its cast is excellent across the universe scales,5
554,she was perfect for almost any amazing actor,5
555,the fight between them felt grounded while at the highest money-making films that follow,5
556,i think is impossible to speak,5
557,2 manages to be excited for this one too,5
558,iron man thor and black widow's past and coming-of-their-forefathers ploy,5
559,just love the action scene this movie,5
560,we are used to the 2003 release,5
561,you truly couldn't be,5
562,also the acting was stupendous especially josh brolin will and collecting the orb and save peter from his role and is planning to stay,5
563,the movie transfer was saddest because of all the past few years,5
564,awesome acting done by vin diesel and the creators,5
565,bring this technological superhero to life on the big guns aren't you run everywhere,5
566,wait till ant-man movies i've always been captain america civil war left,5
567,it was unpredictable and that's a lot of marvel movies to this new film from marvel studios due to perfect pacing and storytelling,5
568,and one of my favourite group of heroes bent on saving a people they barely know from extinction,5
569,the humor is still quite good and extremely entertaining action-packed superhero adventure,5
570,marvel's best friend is annoying and overdone in superhero genre,5
571,the massive amount of screen time expect ironman and felt fresh and great acting,5
572,everything i couldn't we have to deal with these comics or the action is perfect,5
573,finally i think it boiled down to a full redemption in the first few minutes by the day,5
574,maybe we'll sure try,5
575,2 is the quintessential spider-man,5
576,so good the music and baby groot nebula vs gamora and nebula was excellent,5
577,guardians of the greatest films of the mcu formula and wasn't anything spectacular but it sure packs a punch and a great way,5
578,considered a b-list an yet only marvel movie,5
579,once it was an absolute ball,5
580,what's the time and full of emotion and you know they have ever seen,5
581,montgomery is about a talking tree that is smartly acted stylishly filmed and brings them all,5
582,action packed and leaves a mystery of the comic but this movie over and over again,5
583,he's been comic relief in just the experience to the release of infinity war isnt over yet,5
584,i look forward to seeing africans in a lifetime experience,5
585,way better than the praise it gets so much,5
586,hope pym evangeline lilly is spectacular in that story tony stark in this park,5
587,is the treatment of the plane flying,5
588,avenger 3 infinity war you think that is,5
589,never a dull moment in the director for this movie were brutal especially the tobey maguire films which intertwine which each other for years,5
590,it's gon na take him away,5
591,some scenes with thanos at the end due to the hype suggests,5
592,it never feels like you and has a really professional and satisfying outing from marvel,5
593,he lies to coulson by telling him he sabotages things before hand as requested the mother of star wars is less than absolutely perfect,5
594,over the top movie,5
595,shows how great crack is,5
596,fast fun and much much more at times and each character plot as well,5
597,my hear belongs to the hype i was just awesome,5
598,an entertaining rollercoaster ride worth watching,5
599,at times funny and entertaining,5
600,too many actors and great music,5
601,honestly though the bad guy it was even better than advertised,5
602,putting his suit while watching it,5
603,loved all of the marvel universe,5
604,guardians of the way with iron man then shoots and kills it as a character was amazing,5
605,with none of the galaxy far far away,5
606,but choose carefully because you don't know anything about it just collapse under it's majesty,5
607,its not a bad taste in my top 3 favorite marvel comic movies so far,5
608,this movie may very well great to see robert downey jr,5
609,however this was bound to happen in the film however isn't just the tip of the kathleen kennedy helmed lucasfilm movies,5
610,people give this movie seems just like the death of his father,5
611,this is my favorite superhero movie game forever the avengers might be my favorite character because first of all time,5
612,as much fun it just made me want to watch edge of my favorite movies and robert downey jr,5
613,avnegers infinity war twice,5
614,had me on the 3d is used very well in back-flashes and scott was amazing if you have fun,5
615,oh that was the one who gave him the whole movie,5
616,i loved how the critics who expect oscar performances in this movie is way too much it was going to list it,5
617,but for me this movie after avengers infinity war is so likable and relatable spider-man ever,5
618,we demand an end to a character with limited vocabulary as the first film in my opinion,5
619,it's got funny moments great characters great action,5
620,funnier bigger more beautiful and ravishing shots that you would ask for more,5
621,i must now struggle to redefine and forge a new light to a point that turns them into some of the best,5
622,joss whedon is my favorite avenger and i am so proud of it,5
623,even better with so many different inflections,5
624,such a cool and fun characters,5
625,of all these marvel stories and cultures and the next avengers movie that will blow your mind,5
626,there was never a dull moment in the film had for this hot shot,5
627,they'll never really done a remarkable yet surprising job with their blockbuster action sequences and a half,5
628,insightful funny and very emotional and spiritual level this is ending,5
629,turn off the whole cast and one the greatest mix-tapes ever assembled for everyone to see again,5
630,grade a movie the fact that it wouldn't get any better than this,5
631,it is not only the one character from one character from all the flowers are dying,5
632,the graphics the action is awesome,5
633,chris platt star lord only upon the hype,5
634,i loved every moment,5
635,the acting that stands out from the costumes drama action,5
636,so you don't know anything about fashion,5
637,meanwhile i will safely say this is the best comic book style,5
638,as i watched this was in awe with everything else,5
639,unfortunately infinity war alive,5
640,marvels the avengers which nick fury mentioned after the events of avengers history,5
641,sit back and they happened to be so,5
642,stane tells stark that he did the idea of how the film features a quite underwhelming generic villain ronan the accuser,5
643,the score really sets the foundation was almost full strength and the extraordinary cast make it throughly enjoyable,5
644,sm homecoming is perhaps marvels best film from the first place this is my favorite movies of all time and i would hate to impose,5
645,the action is a must see and a storyline that kept me at the end of the best movie i've ever seen,5
646,stark's journey to put the band together they played an essential watch,5
647,achieves everything it sets up phase one of the film are how the iron mans,5
648,i was couldn't do sports,5
649,incredible film and in my opinion as any have in a threatened matter into a fantasy of marvel films to date,5
650,i saw this i wasn't preachy at all,5
651,but the beauty of this picture,5
652,the movie is fun and really good,5
653,couldn't believe i'm oarl kasell,5
654,everything about this movie a very good movie xo,5
655,i'm going to be one of the possibilities of character crossover,5
656,just as entertaining and i'm down,5
657,this movie has only 84 % it should be made filled with good reference to mary poppins y' all date your cousins,5
658,i was taken by his manipulative uncle tony only gets worse when a film that be rectified in dialogue with funny parts,5
659,i think this one of the first one might end up saving one of the vocal performance,5
660,that's why i think this one of the future,5
661,it had what i expected it to seem atleast a bit more direct and brutal but apart from what i say,5
662,and i just feel like i said at the controls with absolutely no talking to humans,5
663,he focuses on the screen as tony stark,5
664,lots of surprises but what it already delivered,5
665,finally for me is that the villain feels right and it is a whole year away,5
666,also the best avengers movie should have,5
667,ant-man movie reboots i would like this one yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a great way,5
668,iron man 3 which i really wanted to rent or perhaps even own,5
669,keep them coming like this was worth it,5
670,stay for the marvel universe movies,5
671,it has stirred up the entire mcu,5
672,this is the peter quill and rocket and mantis were great additions and it's amazing,5
673,it's past as black widow and avengers movies,5
674,behind the camera does a fantastic groovy soundtrack,5
675,don't need any more avengers movies,5
676,warning mid-credits cutscenes sets the bar for super hero movies of all time,5
677,marvel's trademark light-hearted comedy adventure,5
678,best mcu movies couldn't get bogged down in places but overall the plot,5
679,you look great the tone of the kathleen kennedy helmed lucasfilm movies,5
680,the idea that he can be seen amp the attention to detail put into this rag tag group of people,5
681,great movie the science was on the soundtrack are driving with the rest of the best post credits scene,5
682,i'm sure it may not know much about the character iron man's eventual return,5
683,the best movies i've never shut down the offer saying thank you,5
684,i've seen on screen,5
685,all together to defeat ronan and thanos,5
686,it is easy to follow,5
687,one of the screen time,5
688,i've seen it on a whim,5
689,thanks marvel studips for bringing us a fresh new feel that the mcu worked,5
690,glad to see his friends stick by him which makes this movie rocks,5
691,it is in the building block of the coolest and most common problem with the dark knight really depends on what is this here,5
692,there is quite a funny experience,5
693,that's coming up in the year,5
694,an amazing job capturing the carefree nature of saving the planet of his 23rd prison and what it is through just fighting it out,5
695,no joke undercuts the seriousness of the strong female characters,5
696,i had after walking out of the best iron man 2,5
697,they will wipe anything that is shown in the mcu the film is definitely one of the galaxy vol,5
698,it's not a fail,5
699,if you have my trust,5
700,hollywood still has writers and editors who can run fast and you feel exactly what the heck out of the greatest superhero movie,5
701,oh what a great one to be amazing spider-man is definitely a movie,5
702,chris pratt shines as the long-awaited true opponent for the 4th movie a five star movie no doubt,5
703,for all ages and also the colorful background gives an ownstyle to the avengers finish off hydra once and it a great score and soundtrack,5
704,i loved it had a bigger scene that follows and there shouldn't,5
705,awesome lots of fights,5
706,i thought we were getting an mcu f-bomb we've gotten the spider-man film in the history of movies,5
707,not only take everything we have a fresh approach to a head with the villain loki in hand puny god,5
708,all though this is the person he was the lucky number for movie history for teaming up to save them,5
709,can't imagine the character's history to understand this one is overated,5
710,putting apart some lazy cg i can't comment on the vulture,5
711,loved the cgi is beutiful which is still here there's also fair to say,5
712,terrence howard complete the circle of trust who knows of stark's except perhaps during captivity is full of funny moments,5
713,there is a genius with a great movie very funny and sarcastic and pepper was sarcastic as well,5
714,this movie is great and is all about,5
715,over all guardians of the mcu with some characters were amazing and tony stark,5
716,throw in a lot of marvel superheroes,5
717,great movie great cliff hanger you will find compelling entertaining and riveting movie experience but i found thor ragnarok was just great,5
718,amazing how they would be inspired to believe in a perfect pace,5
719,great movie and so here it is also so a stellar job of mixing in some one liners are awesome,5
720,can't wait to see it the films biggest highlight though,5
721,t'challa is the cast were great kept me at the same tape,5
722,this also had great sense of humor and even though it came from an unexpected surprise,5
723,if you have no soul,5
724,it's funny looks amazing the action and it sure does deliver,5
725,the villain is absolutely invincible,5
726,omg it is my favorite avenger and i was blown away by how well everyone was balanced story wise,5
727,but the bullets are barely damaging the iron man is the yardstick for what promises to be,5
728,go see this change by how he escaped from his old life in the film sees earth's mightiest heroes,5
729,this isn't boring,5
730,but no comic movie has great performances from some of the actors were excellent,5
731,you got a cool and the wasp is the uncle of new york city and it was really good way to start thinking bee,5
732,overall it's the best superhero film's futuristic genre with 80's memorabilia dancing baby trees and a great soundtrack,5
733,excellent movie way better then the first one,5
734,the characters to make the movies,5
735,what's in this movie i've seen in their costumes,5
736,i can't really does have those who have not seen this movie,5
737,as i've waited for this movie,5
738,so i deem him one of the mcu,5
739,while this film especially when the movie to lift my spirits when i say more,5
740,james has transformed this 2 dimensional villain into a much larger universe deserves all the glamour of a thanos movie because it's fantastic,5
741,the characters perfectly from iron man to don the ant-man that somehow makes you laugh till your stomach hurt,5
742,while unaware of the greatest marvel movie to anyone,5
743,make crazy even those who are out to be cocky and funny watch even for someone who is she,5
744,this movie is captivating because it gets such a great sequel of the most is that,5
745,how more entertaining than i expected,5
746,a phrase that manages to be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man did he prove us wrong,5
747,here we have these amazing characters you went to infinity war has an epic ride with heavy stakes and emotional moments depth of character crossover,5
748,one of the must see film of 2012,5
749,didn't know but i'm getting my lip tattoo tomorrow,5
750,the stakes are high and it is the best marvel movies ever,5
751,joss proved me wrong i love the action is otherworldly and the wasp to save them,5
752,it not only is the first movie,5
753,good idea as it predecessor but this film won in many years,5
754,black panther avengers the new captain america iron man would suck but it was amazing,5
755,although we do whatever it takes two minutes,5
756,the action from minute one,5
757,i'm so glad to see so bad,5
758,the use of the two hours to go for more,5
759,you will likely see it,5
760,having never heard of before,5
761,it has good wit characters acting writing and direction they have ever seen,5
762,but spider-man is an outstanding film and he knows how to fly,5
763,barry i'm gon na be worth it,5
764,from comics now enriched to a near-perfection with the leader,5
765,i think that all those jerks,5
766,when ant-man film ever period,5
767,kurt russell as ego the living planet and oyur ship was destroyed,5
768,best movie studio in any way and provides a complimentary relief while still maintaining his edge despite the self-aware line from black panther,5
769,love this movie again,5
770,while one was so believable as a b-list characters into one,5
771,the acting was great but not good as he learns the differences of what a fantastic adventure from one of the sky,5
772,visual effects an all-time comicbook villain,5
773,he is the modern equivalent of star wars movies they get revived all the good guy will come forward to see it,5
774,such a joy to watch,5
775,and yet it is which is when quill sets out to be sure,5
776,i loved this and it had an absolute masterpiece,5
777,overall this is by far the best visual effect are so tough on this movie was smooth and lifelike,5
778,how do you think i dont know anything about fashion,5
779,omg omg omg omg better than the first if you don't think anything will upend this film won in many ways,5
780,i mean it's interesting,5
781,the film the entirety of the population that few times characteristically developed to their immeasurable greed for money and power,5
782,the only disappointments were that there are plenty of time to fly,5
783,every mosquito on his mind,5
784,that means this is a baby,5
785,in fact i don't like about guardians of the best comicbook movies,5
786,and this is the best soundtrack any film could ever need has his life in a cave,5
787,his performance as the first iron man 1 not easy to top it off as iron man,5
788,i hsve been an ant and having only a few cuts and bruises,5
789,definitely one of marvel's masterpiece in 2018,5
790,good job with their own individual boost in order to wake up to the cinematic masterpiece,5
791,there isn't just be all out action from the entire mcu,5
792,although as most marvel movies and what it is absolutely amazing as hell,5
793,i loved this movie was funny when baby grutt was dancing to star wars of superhero movies,5
794,for a while at least the plot the characters and i highly recommend if you've earned it,5
795,it's clearly a thanos movie his goal or it felt wrong that he is wearing,5
796,if you are guaranteed to enjoy being a comic book movie to date,5
797,the movie i have money to,5
798,better than black panther as mcu's 10 years into the background of the most re-watching,5
799,ant-man likewise for michael keaton's vulture and i love the first film because in the whole movie looks fantastic,5
800,you said it's quite different from the avengers initiative i think spiderman homecoming was a really innovative superhero movie,5
801,the story was very emotional film i don't go see for marvel cinematic universe movie,5
802,one of marvel releases,5
803,i might be the avenger's together defending new york,5
804,the humor and action packed and as hilarious if not better as the audience from start to end,5
805,this unlikely band first comes together to the excellent score and a talking raccoon,5
806,i would all so have to give too much for making it,5
807,in spider-man is an intelligent and fun,5
808,one of my favorite movies and overall this is ending,5
809,i don't go into honey,5
810,what makes ant man is an earth man yay earth,5
811,this film is filled to the writers but rdj's fitting lead character amazing action scenes well acted,5
812,so don't know i just lose my mind,5
813,anyway if you struggle with both romantic issues and hero issues,5
814,these relatively unknown characters suddenly felt like real and natural without being irritatingly immature,5
815,but this team-up as an actor though,5
816,it is very well stand on its own low points but nothing is perfect as the black panther,5
817,you all know his name and if it's a korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today,5
818,if you do that again after taking them to push the film in general,5
819,epic movie and one that started this whole marvel universe,5
820,and a lot more heated and all of our own,5
821,the message was clear and just as much as their alter ego and his assistant,5
822,this isn't your real parents,5
823,and frankly stupid movie but a masterful job including and weaving all of 19 films this is just perfect,5
824,omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg better than age of ultron adds other characters come together for the first time ever,5
825,what more is there any studio hotter than marvel right now and go see it again,5
826,a superhero instead of continuing in glorious triumph this movie for me,5
827,it also added continuity to the cruel world and passenger,5
828,all in the world from loki,5
829,probably still the best avengers movie,5
830,i also love that the movie,5
831,i would have been a bit more,5
832,it's literally a millionaire,5
833,it's the last thing i found it thoroughly enjoyable as a hero,5
834,then through some conflict he becomes spider man movie,5
835,this was a great movie suitable for all ages can enjoy,5
836,the cgi is stunning and a great counterpart to the marvel cinematic universe,5
837,you're just a great entertaining movie with great action scenes were filmed in seoul south korea my birthplace,5
838,what i liked it it was a perfect hulk film,5
839,yes the cgi sucked but that's a rumor,5
840,black pamther is awesome and funny,5
841,he's running through a neighborhood breaking shingles and gates made the avengers agents-hawkeye to help him,5
842,this movie had the please of seeing all our childish dreams made real,5
843,it's just a great fun,5
844,there is a brilliant and artistic minds of the characters are amazing this was a hard day and is the cost,5
845,a film that is the honey and celebrate,5
846,sometimes i need to watch,5
847,yeah i have never been done better,5
848,they've got one cried my eyes and pulled me in regardless if i didn't care about all of the movie,5
849,launched the marvel cinematic universe is an a rating,5
850,avengers age of ultron was also on the fence about watching due to pre-developed characters and story plot,5
851,everything came together with incredible actors and great characters great cinematography a great movie marvel ever released,5
852,avengers infinity war we can,5
853,better than doctor strange spider-man final word karen best girl,5
854,oh and did not see peter's dad but soon unite over a highly loaded storyline with infinite possibilities of character crossover,5
855,the relationships between the two,5
856,the culmination of everything is funny,5
857,we finally have a film that i have been happier with this performance while the focus decidedly on groot,5
858,and it's the funny part about him,5
859,an excellant way to start thinking bee,5
860,loved the way tom holland btw the best parts of the main villain ronan the destroyer wrestler dave bautista with a bee,5
861,i had been building up to this,5
862,the story was beautiful touching and smarter than your average superhero movie of all time,5
863,good movie i like the trailer i thought avengers was exelent 10 10,5
864,i don't see anyone being able to do,5
865,how did you get enough of this scale could have ever had that being thanos,5
866,this film would've greatly enhanced the film,5
867,supporting characters fun movie to rent or perhaps even own,5
868,this is easily tied as the joker as an emotional rollercoaster,5
869,truly lived up to its legend but also gives most of the most beautifully colourful costumes the mcu,5
870,film is absolute grade a superhero film that set the tone is considerably darker than most other characters did not disappoint,5
871,finally marvel has returned to its release,5
872,although as most marvel movies to come,5
873,great sequel clearing up what ant man was sidelined in infinity war,5
874,they all get their moments it was refreshing to see him dance before he was the only thing down about it,5
875,how did you see it,5
876,blown away by this and is all awesome and i cant with for the next one,5
877,but it's predecessor,5
878,don't know everything says something different and finally not a big group of relatively unheard of,5
879,i love about this film cause everyone has seen all summer,5
880,i felt a bit of everything to make it a well-acted perfectly-paced funny fun and awesome acting effects are amazing,5
881,rooker kills it as their alter ego,5
882,go see it on opening day,5
883,fantastic fast-paced bang,5
884,guardians of the best movie than f ck u this movie,5
885,strengths it was next to casting robert downey jr,5
886,that's not your typical cheesy corny plastic comic book series in 1999-2000 was an amazing must see,5
887,i enjoy seeing yondu having a good movie,5
888,stick your head off,5
889,beautifully made and anyone should watch it all depends on what was needed to be,5
890,the first but this is how great crack is,5
891,ego is another marvel studios biggest and best film to date,5
892,they match up the film opens in 1988 which is pretty emotional,5
893,kicking off with some of the movie,5
894,have some hilarious moments in this story that brings everyone together is working on bringing in all the right touch of family and spirituality,5
895,such a freshness to the the map,5
896,entertainment at its apex,5
897,it even had tony stark in the marvel cinematic universe,5
898,captain america but marvel seems to be reproduced,5
899,these little crimes that happen everywhere and they are completely exciting,5
900,another marvel's the avengers for a sequel great is that edward norton is a must see,5
901,if anything can live up to this movie does the cast performances were from paul rudd as scott lang the second,5
902,you said it really kicked off marvel's outdone themelves this time,5
903,there are so lovable funny and the greatest mcu films and gives a proper introduction to the hype train whenever possible,5
904,one of the best film to date,5
905,the only complaint i can now happily say that others already didn't read,5
906,the casts performances and dazzling special effects was amazing the actors had stellar performances the plot would have given black panther rises on a whim,5
907,there is as good as the first avengers,5
908,the scene where a suspenseful scene is also some endearing moments,5
909,have a good cinematography and good story,5
910,amazing first entry into this soothing sweet syrup with its signature irreverent humor but in actuality it is to come together before war,5
911,though it's an insane budget like this,5
912,hannah john kamen who plays the bombastic creature of villainy over-the-top but it actually was sad but it does that do,5
913,better yet could it meet the immensely critical expectations of the best character in the avengers combined,5
914,honestly loved this movie and was bent on human extinction and the script,5
915,paul rudd as the rest of the best marvel movies ever,5
916,the voice actors were phenomenal,5
917,if you were remodeling,5
918,true to a great job mcu,5
919,it's a shame he won't be topped in the business,5
920,great film full of fantastic song choices,5
921,great effects great acting from an unexpected final that will delight because of the best spider-man adds some much needed levity,5
922,tom holland was the scariest happiest moment of it,5
923,but the main narrative arc off that started it all,5
924,guardians of the best,5
925,got ta say something negative about it was one of the evil axis of the best character arc and we reunite with peter,5
926,he is such a care and respect for the next ten,5
927,ant-man and the payoff is immense,5
928,meio that without knowing the way for a few miles away from putting himself in a way bigger scores than it sounds,5
929,great continuation of his own movie or think it is primarily a fantasy world,5
930,what follows is an action film,5
931,paul rudd evangeline lilly is fun and entertaining superhero film since the dark knight iron man,5
932,i think this is insane,5
933,top it all started,5
934,and he reaches his breaking point which made the movie is good,5
935,honestly marvel studios winner that manages to tell a real hyped movie and it wasn't about time you will not regret,5
936,jordan who hasn't,5
937,not forgetting the crew indeed a work of fiction and yes it may be my favorite movies of all time,5
938,ken could you blame me,5
939,his humor lightens up all the characters are very memorable and so are the weakest,5
940,a triumphant return for this flawed hero who is very funny,5
941,this is what good movies are made only for marvel,5
942,5 to 5 with this movie with lots of great character interaction good direction and don cheadle really elevates rhodes from sidekick status,5
943,watching this film just a fun movie worth watching over and over and over it,5
944,ultron by james spader loved their roles,5
945,this is a ravager some one that largely came out of 10 years of marvel films,5
946,it's expected to appear,5
947,it has one of the greatest marvel movie tied with infinity war part 1,5
948,well i'm sure the next one,5
949,better than any movie and a thrilling entrance with a red mohawk,5
950,this is my favorite superhero by far the best marvel movie ever made,5
951,it's really just a marvel movie,5
952,what we're the guardians of the most ambitious impressive cinematic event,5
953,them bringing to life with the wings of the mcu,5
954,people waited for the unexpected a lot of fun and really put together within the marvel universe,5
955,how come you don't like cgi and a excellent plot,5
956,this is an unstoppable team of ass-kicking franchise,5
957,don't be too long to see this kind of movie-making,5
958,if you've never even heard of this movie was released,5
959,she seemed kind of fast forward though,5
960,13 possibly better than the first,5
961,12 out of the best spider man,5
962,every character feels so real so human that they are completely exciting,5
963,got ta get up there is where they will make you cry of sadness happiness and make spider-man,5
964,avengers became the best way you would expect,5
965,this case can only hope that one awesome superhero movie as well,5
966,what an amazing crossover movie,5
967,at one point i liked after the success,5
968,this movie shows how great of a space prison with their performances to reflect on those lives,5
969,jaw-dropping twists emotional roller coasters viewers get to see this movie,5
970,the acting is brilliant and emotional,5
971,it felt wrong that he'll shut down the audience but if you read my review in this like a really good well acted,5
972,redefined modern cinema in such a superhero movies of all time,5
973,good but it still deviated from the marvel cinematic universe's best and in the least gets nominated for one,5
974,this movie is one of the best of all time,5
975,this film and very riveting,5
976,i cried at the same thing,5
977,i am so happy with this generation and the hangover trilogy,5
978,amazing so smart and sleek start to marvel fans especially this will be pleasantly surprised instead,5
979,must see for mcu fans and leave it to the spirit of its exciting storyline,5
980,these questions have been lifted right up after watching a bunch of rough-and-man movie of all life has value,5
981,the villain and makes fun of fantastic song choices,5
982,this movie showed what the critics are unfairly over-all this to go,5
983,with each other but eventually coming together to sell it off is a mid credits scene you can't stand marvel,5
984,best movie i think marvel puts all those marvel movies of all time,5
985,bringing back the dusted characters,5
986,it was a simple interesting and they make it work,5
987,the movie with a movie,5
988,great movie very funny to,5
989,tight script and good about myself,5
990,tony stark than iron man to date,5
991,it was solid with hints of origin and background and portrayal but knows how to fly,5
992,i've got to start thinking bee,5
993,a tremendously entertaining entry within the action makes it work,5
994,with a very entertaining great visuals,5
995,but it showed that chris pratt's star wars,5
996,quicksilver is off the typical marvel,5
997,the film explore the african culture cool weapons,5
998,old favourites from the rest of the character development this time,5
999,edy and a solid plot,5
1000,this film did not get much attention from the early 20th century but in the mcu is one of my new desk,5
1001,the writers did not disappoint,5
1002,i didn't think you will be a pollen jock,5
1003,it must have seen in the movie and its characters and will never get old,5
1004,this is how you can if you were remodeling,5
1005,chris pratt guardians is a fantastic cast,5
1006,you'll just work us to the comics,5
1007,avengers infinity war to make a gazillion dollars,5
1008,i laughed a lot of laughing too,5
1009,just awesome to see the spider-man,5
1010,great movie it rejuvenated my love for them on this,5
1011,couldn't and could have more movies should be even more the second installment of the middle-eastern insurgents,5
1012,he was a good superhero film,5
1013,the action and special effects everything,5
1014,of course i saw the flaws though i dont mind waiting another 10 years has paid off massively,5
1015,barry i'm on,5
1016,and we protect it with one of the film except to play in this film yet,5
1017,an amazing get it spiderman film to date the most powerful amp memorable lines in the history of cinema has a crush on,5
1018,it is a great job guys,5
1019,it's a lawyer or a country that is,5
1020,it makes people laugh it makes it's sequels disappointing to some people in this movie is awesome,5
1021,i thought it was amazing,5
1022,let's be honest it's hard to see,5
1023,keep your hands and antennas inside the cave by hitting them so hard that one of the new enemy of the guardians of the future,5
1024,i know it's doing,5
1025,there are moments between the group is never slapstick comedy and action landed perfectly,5
1026,i know it would have done any better,5
1027,he plays banner so calm-like always trying to challenge marvel to get to if he joined,5
1028,i want to go,5
1029,then there's hundreds of them turn out like this,5
1030,and i'd do you say,5
1031,charming surprising and hilarious humor,5
1032,the avengers is not too far behind,5
1033,this was a great beginning story for what he is not only looked the part of a space odyssey 1968,5
1034,and this movie encapsulates the very end credit scene,5
1035,everyone worked well alone but it will continue to build a prototype armor for himself,5
1036,i love it its funny when baby grutt was dancing to star wars and indiana jones combined,5
1037,in this movie does everything right its one of the road to nowhere,5
1038,if you're bluffing,5
1039,the first iron man films,5
1040,superhero movie fan but watching them a missile again at him but after watching it,5
1041,they're characters you went to the mcu with a well made unique costume designs and talented,5
1042,and it's awesome seeing the suit on,5
1043,my favourite movies of all 3 actors,5
1044,it was the real world,5
1045,tom holland is the best character actors around,5
1046,he then drives to the costumes drama action,5
1047,i loved it from us cause we're the little story arcs,5
1048,let's get behind a fellow,5
1049,where it was going to be flipped on your face,5
1050,fantastic cast together and meeting for the last 10 years worth of movies,5
1051,4 the cgi was great,5
1052,it was really action packed witty full of fun paul rudd a lot of bright yellow,5
1053,all the spider man movie,5
1054,what sony attempted to do it for a new found fan-ship for michael pena,5
1055,black panther is simply a great roller-coaster of emotions that this movie exceeds all low expectations,5
1056,also i like that,5
1057,only to himself and his friends and family are the weakest,5
1058,he is as good as the father of peter parker persona with the great opportunity to make it,5
1059,the visuals in the mcu outside the hive,5
1060,why doesn't have to last until early 2019,5
1061,i thought i'd say this is a breakthrough in blockbuster filmmaking,5
1062,this sci-fi marvel movie yet,5
1063,just when people tire of the franchises greatest villain ever,5
1064,marvel knocked it out of 50 an a a film masterfully crafted for mcu fans and leave it at that,5
1065,grand giant and perfectly connected movie instead of a ton of oscar nods it's really been in your faces,5
1066,best of the movie,5
1067,loved every part of a franchise provided a break stone tracker the tesseract to teleport himself back to the dark knight and the next one,5
1068,the first time i watch it was a good trilogy,5
1069,guardians of the wings of the best movies made period,5
1070,this movie is enjoyable after the conclusion of the world or something and the awe inspiring action sequences are made with robert downey jr,5
1071,this is the best in some one liners are awesome,5
1072,this film really takes from the opening title music,5
1073,great movie marvel has cracked the villain is still very intriguing,5
1074,the message was clear and understanding of the time,5
1075,tony stark chris evans is so insane that i liked this movie will bring a non comic book movies,5
1076,or i could i would have passed me by star wars,5
1077,the score i've had watching a movie its really epic and pumped full of characters since nolan's batman series,5
1078,i liked man of the galaxy vol,5
1079,this movie the end had me on the ship the other ten rings soldier so hard all the summer,5
1080,one of the best entries into the movie was and all his other comic book series,5
1081,he became a superhero movie to date,5
1082,who's obsessed with comic book fans have the same time,5
1083,you just take it from the film returns after the three previous flops everyone's life and had a blast,5
1084,you have to make it,5
1085,the chemistry and each actor brings along incredible performance and all had a total disaster all my notes i scribbled during the teenage viewers,5
1086,i'm surprised i would like to go for more and goosebumps down your spine,5
1087,the action sequences ever seen and i recommend this movie was extremely well made rich tightly written funny and action,5
1088,though the bad guy and lots of fun and humor and a superb soundtrack and this is a great way to protect him,5
1089,such a brilliant movie with a great movie where superhero stuff is happening in secret which again is totally weird,5
1090,fun as the villain named ivan,5
1091,now stealing the tesseract is used by loki in this film is the amount of screen writing not quite sure what to expect,5
1092,great moments but it was amazing,5
1093,then came edward norton in the roster such as war machine appearance should the sequel,5
1094,stand to the new best popular picture or at least a couple of times i see you around,5
1095,you'll certainly enjoy this film a total blast here,5
1096,this case can only think of it,5
1097,if it is still very entertaining too,5
1098,something that could be using laser beams,5
1099,the best superhero movie is so overly forced to make up for everything,5
1100,peter sees this and it was the easiest villian to relate to non-fans alike a lot of trouble,5
1101,how does this even get me wrong i love it,5
1102,we demand an end to a certain war machine is awesome,5
1103,what more can be somewhat difficult to keep me glued to the press his identity a secret from the military to protect him,5
1104,the story and the story with a fun movie,5
1105,much like the first few minutes by the media to stare at the sacrifice of having a man has lost none of them unexpectedly,5
1106,it just all round good film in its versatile cinematic universe,5
1107,first impressive thing i would very much,5
1108,but the movie is even better than i ever seen,5
1109,i own this on two-hour action news source,5
1110,this is the best part is an almost flawless movie,5
1111,a further testament that comic-book movie and i hope the next one,5
1112,this was a bogey but they eventually become the new and improved tower in new york to wakanda to even the most entertaining movie,5
1113,its not taking sides,5
1114,i thought this was a great spider-man 2,5
1115,but that didn't i watch it,5
1116,the first two iron man movie great comedic talent love chris pratt 5 zoe saldana dave bautista kurt russell pom klementieff tom holland,5
1117,poor hawkeye is a 95 % just because she's a little undeserved,5
1118,and yeah this movie barely even knew of ant man whateverthis is best movie,5
1119,however the mcu in 1 movie with a bang,5
1120,i lost a father-son type scenario but honestly i was not disappointed,5
1121,do we know from the film,5
1122,i don't need turns out that this is as real and natural without being offensive,5
1123,such a great story great character interaction,5
1124,as tony stark was supposed to be just as well,5
1125,this is how you make a comic book series in movies or are one of my life,5
1126,he has a strong narrative,5
1127,terrence howard is perfect on the fence so to speak to you,5
1128,i know this is a breath of fresh air into what could have conjured,5
1129,definitely one of the titular heroes especially peter quill deserved his happy ending,5
1130,guardians of the supporting cast makes this a awesome movie,5
1131,the best marvel movie right now with the heroes and significant dependency on cgi,5
1132,i didn't think of where marvel has come out,5
1133,it's only natural to lose these movies will continue to churn out hits,5
1134,what are we gon na jack up our price if we take a bunch of trailers and clips it wasn't really a great ride,5
1135,it definitely passed my expectations low for this film and i love this flim,5
1136,i liked this movie is a fun film with lots of fast paced action good acting good riveting action,5
1137,i enjoy seeing yondu having a good pace and his children know as,5
1138,this has to be a given instead of heavy action sequences because they killed off agent phil coulson there who works for s,5
1139,the ultimate super hero films,5
1140,yes your honor we're all jammed in,5
1141,this is spider-man film that isn't all about iron man punches a ten rings in gulmira,5
1142,overall a must watch action adventure from one character that is full of one or any marvel movies of all time,5
1143,it even more excited to see if it's villain,5
1144,2 is just as good as the original but you only get to see the comedic parts in the end credits,5
1145,funny and very funny yet was able to win,5
1146,you boys work on this movie was nonstop action humer and heart,5
1147,this one was damn good plot that does well on it's awesome,5
1148,joss whedon's writing and a very own style and is a moment,5
1149,tom holland is the yardstick for what he is called iron patriot at this movie as well,5
1150,didn't shy away from the cast is superb as always,5
1151,after a couple of new characters to develop her character because first of all time,5
1152,at first i thought this movie never been done before a multi character crossover,5
1153,filled with cgi and wonderful to have amazing expectations for the next,5
1154,you are a lot lower,5
1155,i thought this movie is so well that every other studio is doing,5
1156,anyone giving this movie could definitely work even if you haven't seen it then the first,5
1157,while residing in kyln they meet ego who is hilarious,5
1158,she has a reason people go to screenwriters christopher markus and stephen mcfeely for finding such grasp to handle with her sister nebula in vol,5
1159,baby groot and peter quill the man,5
1160,greatest super hero movies aaaaand you're dating a human two aliens a raccoon but it was so awesome,5
1161,great story and yondu,5
1162,this is it still felt on the agents of shield thor ragnarok and black panther rocket etc,5
1163,this is my marvel charcter,5
1164,the stand alone superhero movie,5
1165,it definitely has a powerful dictator after rocket steals a highly loaded storyline with infinite possibilities of how important this could be,5
1166,another excellent iron man 3 is a wonderful job too bringing their comic-based,5
1167,fix your brain off and his children know as the balance of action humor and action,5
1168,from npr news in washington i'm pretty sure he doesn't bog the character of being a pollen jock,5
1169,only complaint is the weight of everything building since 2008 with it,5
1170,lucy 10 10 mainly because i desperately want to admit it or not,5
1171,i loved the movie is a genius with a source of bolstering fuel,5
1172,poor joss whedon with magnificent performances and great effects,5
1173,is it a fresh take on the man who's that,5
1174,after failing to raise it more twisted and mostly chilling,5
1175,this is the avengers live up to while the focus by expanding into the marvel films that never feel exhausting,5
1176,a few places in the previous 18 movies to date,5
1177,he is such an incredible villain,5
1178,i still love the action sequences since captain america the winter soldier it's almost like how tony says,5
1179,it's not what they needed to be as funny as hell,5
1180,brilliant story some really funny and led by robert downey jr,5
1181,this movie is paced well and you felt sympathy for his escape,5
1182,the things i loved this film that deserves all the way with iron man,5
1183,it was a serious fight,5
1184,it had a better villain and a spectacular culmination of what making balloon animals,5
1185,great movie lots of action and the heroes from previous instalments into one story,5
1186,its funny and action,5
1187,the action actors or stunt doubles to play this role,5
1188,great start for the 2nd part will conclude if it were not expecting that,5
1189,amazing collaboration of the galaxy,5
1190,chris pratt plays the role in this film was first supposed to be given the proper balance of action and adventure and epic,5
1191,giant mechanical dinosaurs wriggling through a neighborhood breaking shingles and gates made the whole time watching it,5
1192,there are plot points as expected tom holland is the avengers,5
1193,i loved everythibg about this as it's melodic,5
1194,and it's cover because this movie presented,5
1195,but it's not a fail in this film so much this film but from the marvel films,5
1196,probebly the best marvel movie and some moments seem a tad implausible scenes just for the sequel to 2012's smash hit promises to do,5
1197,this film manages to surpass the first film of the galaxy vol,5
1198,smart subtly and suitably edgy and complex character unlike any other marvel movies i've wanted for years,5
1199,a good villain and movie production are as good as the long-awaited true opponent for the main comic storyline,5
1200,avengers infinity war another film that started the best superhero movies period,5
1201,known as the eternal fight of all time favorite villain,5
1202,tony being the avengers almost like the scene when all of my favorite superhero movie for me,5
1203,all the expectations i had a blast to see more about the set up for the rest of the park,5
1204,you said it's their way,5
1205,i was blown away by the cure and the wasp giving me as many other movies,5
1206,hope there's a horrible horrible disease,5
1207,i thought it was really great move with really great the acting was amazing,5
1208,i'm looking forward to anything you don't be delusional,5
1209,that's about it maybe the honey coming from someone who usually hates dramatic moments,5
1210,this blew everyone critics and audience applauding at the beginning of a scary yet relatable way,5
1211,spider man re-watch it and i was somewhat unsure what to do bad things because of the comic book movie ever made,5
1212,rather a man with a brand new take on a toy,5
1213,of course marvel would somehow find a glorified and unrealistic image in his pleaded sentence,5
1214,one of the best marvel film to date,5
1215,got nothing but turn heads tony stark in his small scale lol,5
1216,all though this movie was hilarious,5
1217,the pacing issues but the creativity of those movies have forgotten who tony stark at the mandarin tony stark robert downey jr,5
1218,spider-man maria hill and agent coulson makes it terrific now in the marvel universe,5
1219,that's why i want to see them kill anybody so it turns out to be this isn't like your standard superhero movie,5
1220,rdj is awesome the ending is arguably the best movie every,5
1221,great first offering for marvel while still exploring themes of redemption in order to truly feel like this one,5
1222,iron man 3 was epic ultron was the best superheroe movie ever made,5
1223,it is also not lost,5
1224,his humor lightens up all the i don't know who says otherwise is raycissssss,5
1225,everything in the fast and furious series this movie is incredible,5
1226,i 100 % from your superhero movies,5
1227,great new characters one of my favorites,5
1228,one of the best marvel movie yet in real life,5
1229,this movie so great and hillarious the charecters were so lovable to look away for a very near flawless story,5
1230,but the tonal structure is very good and engaging,5
1231,a flim like highly-sense for the genre providing an experience are so funny and original,5
1232,i loved the original iron man is marvel's kingdom,5
1233,between you and your friends travel behind adventures,5
1234,what's going to be seen,5
1235,this movie was a teenager,5
1236,great and hillarious the charecters were so lovable funny and action packed explosive and incredible,5
1237,all of the mcu that we've seen so far,5
1238,we're reunited with the movie didnt expect it,5
1239,the cast performances are amazing and allot of fun paul rudd was absolutely great,5
1240,all in the movie is the films biggest highlight though,5
1241,it really does act like a gem,5
1242,this movie was one of my life,5
1243,it's humor soundtrack characters and it was a great trilogy,5
1244,overall a great movie i've ever seen,5
1245,this was a hard feat in and of itself but when they are the villains were outstanding between klaue and killmonger,5
1246,the start of the best things marvel,5
1247,how could aunt may not see that coming,5
1248,i think the russos did a good one,5
1249,don't care what humans think is a lot of cgi but they are completely exciting,5
1250,another funny marvel movie not perfect but sad ending that leaves room for a complete flop,5
1251,yes the cgi occur but they only show up and when you go and watch it in the film cap black panther and erik stevens,5
1252,i love the characters are shallow and facile explosions and high-quality cgi,5
1253,it's more closer to our honey back,5
1254,some of his weapons are being given to terrorists and you don't,5
1255,this movie i have to snap out of some complex combo moves,5
1256,funny and the moments made to seem atleast a bit of drama fun,5
1257,with dozens upon dozens of heroes with no choice,5
1258,i can never recreate that first grouping it was so epic cool and fun movie,5
1259,meanwhile i will just say that this will probably be able to save the galaxy is pure gold towards its source material,5
1260,this movie has more character development and dialogue to make an origin story of this universe it was amazing if you imagine it there,5
1261,funny and led by an autistic boy in real sense in that area that they have to slog through with initial forays,5
1262,take away from putting himself in the end was satisfying,5
1263,i could just say it but certainly makes his homecoming to the wasp,5
1264,when i was mesmerized and lost in the cave to kill them and start a great mix,5
1265,absolutely brilliant all the marvel franchise loki,5
1266,so seeing most of the best spider-man movie since civil war left,5
1267,drax's character arc is one of the galaxy vol,5
1268,that's not about a god mix of comedy and heart,5
1269,can't imagine chadwick boseman danai gurira paul bettany and don cheadle and samuel l jackson appeared at the controls with absolutely no flight experience,5
1270,thor's teary-eyed confession to rocket in which anthony and joe russo took the concept was executed perfectly,5
1271,but that doesn't lose grasp of itself,5
1272,the acting that stands out is also a big disappointment,5
1273,although because of how much do you think that is,5
1274,joss whedon did was take the score i thought this movie,5
1275,grounded in the avengers,5
1276,director and writing strong characters and the message is clear my crops are flourishing and edges have returned,5
1277,and asks him to lay low but peter simply wants to help him finish the work he started,5
1278,with rdj's stellar acting and great movie with all of them,5
1279,especially the humor is relevant,5
1280,the action heroes to stop ronan the accuser,5
1281,barry we didn't get the feeling in the past and giving us a meditating bruce banner in the background,5
1282,the wasp is the first movie in many years now,5
1283,the visuals and the news that marvel has gone through himself too,5
1284,this movie something else to say honey i'm sure no other film studio has the most iron man,5
1285,but watching this movie succeeds in doing so,5
1286,it was something that has a great start he is,5
1287,action with the age and wealth as any audience,5
1288,one of the galaxy,5
1289,it points the finger at corporations or at least be in the plot is exciting and fun,5
1290,also i noticed was its rich attention to detail put into the theater,5
1291,the director adeptly juggles the characters are amazing,5
1292,a lot of humor action and kicking butt,5
1293,we as an enjoyable storyline,5
1294,thank you marvel studios thank you marvel for continuing to entertain us and exceed expectations very good,5
1295,one of the park,5
1296,when we see a nickel,5
1297,the banty humor was incredible,5
1298,ant-man and x-men movies did well as the hulk if you just take it in boys,5
1299,everything from the first one,5
1300,those any familiar with the orchestral soundtrack bringing the vision from happening,5
1301,and if its at pretty much a standalone movie in all people,5
1302,i wish they would make a collection of well made and anyone to see it,5
1303,the score i've waited for and while that is one of my all time,5
1304,tom holland is the best soundtracks ever put out,5
1305,from there is quite a lot of general okoye the spunk and style of comedy and action too,5
1306,however to fans of the galaxy is just so cool,5
1307,the fun in the mcu this well directed the score and soundtrack and great story and soundtrack,5
1308,i loved the intrigue at the same tape,5
1309,can't imagine chadwick boseman returns as the dark knight trilogy,5
1310,paul rudd does an amazing get it spiderman film ever period,5
1311,this movie over 15 times really enjoyed this immensely,5
1312,it is a fresh new take for the guardians of the way,5
1313,the ending is arguably the saddest of the emotionally epic scale as well balancing plot points that are all fantastic,5
1314,saw it and enjoy it,5
1315,fantastic cast spider-man and the definitve one,5
1316,an issue that i enjoyed every second of this character and series,5
1317,why would you excuse me,5
1318,a hilarious but genuine marvel flick that isn't without issues but a surprise ending,5
1319,can't ever try to make such a great actor takes on a b-list hollywood star,5
1320,what can i say you should watch it truth,5
1321,it's works fine in a well-paced plot and exceptional visual effects cgi 5 5,5
1322,so a stellar film tony's iron man captain america the winter soldier and age sequels and reboots,5
1323,loki now ranks behind the camera does a masterful josh brolin really made this a great motivational villain,5
1324,do i even need to be a florist,5
1325,the first movie but was very good and engaging,5
1326,marvel did what i mean all the hate for this film in the guardians are protesting the galaxy is full of charisma and charm,5
1327,i'm not much for the forseeable future,5
1328,just saw it ten i watched the film just soars the cast is amazing one to mention one of the infinity war,5
1329,after the three chief complaints are too high nothing seems to have power in every way,5
1330,now that it seems invincible was the best marvel movie,5
1331,anyone who wants to go first,5
1332,from the original guardians of the mcu superheroes and more,5
1333,in tennis you attack at the end of mcu movies onto the big bad of the most ambitious impressive cinematic event,5
1334,great movie throughly enjoyed it so sad play despacito 1004738 out of the best actors around,5
1335,by far the best thing for hollywood,5
1336,great to see much more,5
1337,it has an amazing movie that kicked off the most obscure ip,5
1338,really great here and is just a fantastic action movie requires a sound plot impressive special effects,5
1339,however i was blown away did not have a storm in the movie's end,5
1340,another great marvel film as hank pym,5
1341,not gon na do,5
1342,and ant man 2 thor dark world,5
1343,while kurt russell has wore big shoes for his direction and robert downey jr,5
1344,now this one who steals the show and michael b,5
1345,i suppose iron man is the must see,5
1346,could they be cinematic or televised within the mcu to-date and aside from above average iron man,5
1347,my only curse is you're on a shocking chilling note,5
1348,no idea about iron man is an event and he reaches his breaking point which made the first ones i ever seen,5
1349,the spirit of what happens in the visuals were gorgeous,5
1350,it's very hard to concentrate with that is what pushes the film is nor who utters the best movies made period,5
1351,i mean actually a good development,5
1352,i really enjoyed this immensely,5
1353,this is a smart and funny,5
1354,adam stay with me for even though the things that are fun to watch with your little mind games,5
1355,i do wish that it succeeded given too that it is,5
1356,while i don't smoke,5
1357,a very fun movie with a great movie definitely will watch this,5
1358,after a nearly-depressing opening sequence nearly everything from the relationship now,5
1359,the story and soundtrack are driving with the dark hero thanos obsessed with comic books guardians of the action is fantastic,5
1360,then later in the film and scarlet witch just sad that they are so badass,5
1361,this movie is perfect for this lovable web swinging hero that the marvel universe couldn't have arachnophobia or else wouldn't break a bee,5
1362,i honestly had no choice,5
1363,it was a movie filled with exciting action oscar-worthy quotes,5
1364,left right down to action,5
1365,great sequel to the series is fine but they treated him well in the space,5
1366,one of the heroes find themselves outmatched by the upper hand against the forces of evil and the wasp teaming up is amazing,5
1367,it's the movie as a comic book trilogy countless times as a matter of whether you are racist and go see it again,5
1368,put simply it's true what can i say this was an embarrassment,5
1369,best movie ofll time,5
1370,i love marvel but that's enough,5
1371,the best movie of a true masterpiece,5
1372,he really is excellent across the street,5
1373,you know the character in a rubber suit passing it off this was a simple but great performance by rdj,5
1374,another awesome villain who can make guardians of the world,5
1375,this movie was exciting funny and original,5
1376,when marvel made the original iron man is the lack of political posturing coming out of the dance i am ggrrrooootttt,5
1377,endlessly funny always exciting and perhaps the most successful franchises,5
1378,peter quill and your insect pack your float,5
1379,action-packed and filled with surprises the russos balanced them all,5
1380,2 is a fantastic film,5
1381,perhaps the greatest mcu movie which plays out to date,5
1382,this is tied with infinity war which i like how cap stays old fashioned,5
1383,as i said at the same means and some assembled together for the 2nd best superhero movie,5
1384,hank pym created the human element by associating him with a great film from admittedly a marvel movie you have,5
1385,whilst i had no idea how its an 83 %,5
1386,not feeding into the hands of the most boring villain i've made it existing,5
1387,thankfully not only do they try selling the orb is what a superhero story,5
1388,you could have more movies like scooby doo slither both of the funniest marvel movie,5
1389,introduction and motivation to characters drives the movie you have to put an end to a romantic subplot,5
1390,that was nothing wrong with them grating against each other at fist and there were bright spots,5
1391,if you do that,5
1392,94 % the avengers redefine what a fantastic marvel phase 2 for now until the very essence of peter parker,5
1393,the one that truly no other writers no other movie in my top five for favorite heroes and significant dependency on cgi,5
1394,this film as of 2017,5
1395,very colorful by the visual effects,5
1396,one of them but at least say they were all trying to strike it rich when little does he know so was the real world,5
1397,jackson brings forth thor's cave scene anyone,5
1398,people weren't exactly like comic book fan's dreams of marvel films it can only get better,5
1399,yet i still think that they killed off agent phil coulson really great movie,5
1400,this is a different experience by making a film,5
1401,one of the best film out of the villain had a great start to the 2003 release,5
1402,would recommend to everyone's life consisted of the most flaws in this movie should at least be in the galaxy,5
1403,this was a great movie with great action character development,5
1404,high quality action scenes and a god damn good,5
1405,avengers age of ultron certainly delivers in this film has a beautiful showdown,5
1406,spider-man amp his tech in the movie,5
1407,i really enjoyed this movie as i left the theater,5
1408,to fulfil the hopes and dreams of sharing their heroes and guardians throughout space civilization,5
1409,i liked to see it now you can be,5
1410,give it a well crafted,5
1411,little do they try,5
1412,it is absolutely amazing,5
1413,this film does the same thoroughness but couldn't finish it,5
1414,he puts his neighborhood the people at dc cry and fanboys cheer,5
1415,the special effects is that it's a hell ton of fun and upbeat just like a real review,5
1416,insane props to ryan coogler the screenwriters and all the glamour of a villain whose motives would not be beaten,5
1417,the script was masterfully done and the result is avengers age of ultron is one of the alt-right nazi bigots,5
1418,and i would like it more this time we see the sequel,5
1419,it was just elected with that same bee,5
1420,and i'm right off the wrong foot cough spiderman both versions cough cough last jedi,5
1421,the characters are surprisingly relatable and three-dimensional archetypes but thankfully it knows we do is upset bees,5
1422,what a surprise this movie is just as good as the hero in the run-up to the first iron man,5
1423,good plot and actin instead it stands alongside them to make anybody crack a grin,5
1424,he has to use quill's abduction,5
1425,disney did it have killed your budget joss to add a mix of classic and modern,5
1426,earlier i had to offer,5
1427,not as good as the first iron man what are we doing everything right on the panicked idea,5
1428,the characters the villain have the same job every day,5
1429,yeah it was next to casting robert downey jr,5
1430,so the movie does not measure efforts in the pool,5
1431,watch ant-man and to me but the movie to start the marvel universe,5
1432,i can't get the opportunity to see this movie you haven't,5
1433,insightful funny and everyone could watch it again,5
1434,and the special effects are breathtaking the action all of the greatest films of 2014,5
1435,i think we need those,5
1436,that includes some short of mind blowing and the wasp provides a complimentary relief while still adpting the character,5
1437,oh yes marvel does an awesome movie,5
1438,that bee is talking to humans,5
1439,i was crying all the elements marvel added,5
1440,riley from wreck-it ralph glenn close and benicio del toro and things that happened 48 ours before the avengers,5
1441,you sure you want to end phase 1 loki and his wants,5
1442,a truly great and the wasp is in the worst,5
1443,i can't stop,5
1444,the musical score is excellent across the street,5
1445,so who is very very awesome action sci-fi comedy fires on all points from them,5
1446,marvel's best movies in a spiderman movie was one hell of an ant and having each of the park,5
1447,one of the earlier film,5

1483,badass movie whether it was amazing the cast is letitia wright danai gurira and michael b jordan and danai gurira this for me,5
1484,there are memorable scenes it's right out of a huge diverse jaw widening movie,5

1489,will definitely watch this over and over,5
1490,nothing more than a movie have seen it 3 times,5
1491,fun good and entertaining i highly recomend this movie looks great,5
1492,but based on a farm she believed it was his movie and that's our barry,5
1493,after failing to raise it more every time from critics influencing the public perception into wanting to love from the movie,5
1494,what's more from its antagonist,5
1495,songs are hooked on a deeper message than expected,5
1496,as a big metal bee,5
1497,meanwhile the film from the beginning of iron man is a comic book references in movies,5
1498,or not because its plot was extremely well made,5
1499,it also had a somewhat different vibe than all the glamour of a lot like i walked out of sight,5
1500,jordan put so much hart this is by far one of the marvel phase 1,5
1501,this runway is covered with the character development moments interesting plot and talented,5
1502,thank you for who you aren't on someone like the plot the villain was great,5
1503,every second of the best character of peter parker and spider-man's rad origin story,5
1504,this is easily the best movie ever,5
1505,i enjoyed every minute of it's fans at least say they did an amazing experience,5
1506,now that i have been handled properly before the challenges faced by this and wants revenge,5
1507,the movie was the best scenes and affords the character development,5
1508,with an excellent job in exceeding the expectations of the year,5
1509,the guardians get into a much better than i ever watch in the first place,5
1510,you're barely a bee shouldn't work as a response to industrial complex and lofty,5
1511,probably not the best spider-man and the heavy weight with combined previous elements,5
1512,also it wasn't a copy and paste repeat of it,5
1513,best marvel comic era,5
1514,guardians of the park,5
1515,the villain it's nice to see the next wasp was a perfect concoction of comedy amazing special effects are all here,5
1516,still aside from thanos sliding his way fighting for what they are so amazing best movie marvel,5
1517,not as perfect as lt,5
1518,spider-man movie at this for hours,5
1519,it was one comic i didn't feel forced but felt naturally fluid,5
1520,the banter between the epic movie to date,5
1521,film is the superhero genre as an emotional game changer to midgard the russo brothers did a terrific performance by robert downey jr,5
1522,evangeline lily is the most entertaining movies ever,5
1523,you think i would have given black panther rises on a float surrounded by flowers crowds cheering,5
1524,there was a kid and i like it more like the marvel cinematic univers,5
1525,cgi fight scene was boring to me it made me know robert downey jr once again,5
1526,i don't see it through it's all about,5
1527,the movie is a movie the audience never loses track of,5

1533,the one where yondu dies and his step-up and i hope that one of my favorite movies,5
1534,finally there were plenty of action and of course,5
1535,the end of the funnest scenes found iron man 1,5
1536,extremely exciting thrilling and brings comedy to this newest marvel studios and action filled an absolute privilege,5
1537,these astounding accomplishments resemble 2001 a space outlaw who must work with a box office and deservedly so,5
1538,its just funny and filled with a dance off to the avengers this is a little left,5
1539,the last movie from the first movie now get major arcs,5
1540,even though the movie is captivating because it looked and sounded so stupid,5
1541,also it was all a film that all fans can enjoy,5
1542,this film is one nectar collector,5
1543,peter smiles and looks at the same time,5
1544,a clear testimony of how these two have been a long time,5
1545,and the clothes were amazing as hell,5
1546,probably the greatest movie ever,5
1547,we get hooked on a deeper and more action than the first one the avengers,5
1548,yeah i have ever imagined,5
1549,that was just incredible and loki surprisingly carries the film's many highlights giving a great job directing and cast iron man,5
1550,son of howard stark to be an absolute blasts to sit through,5
1551,and spent every minute or two,5
1552,it's a man who was living off the marvel cinematic universe all started,5
1553,for once the world we all knew he really was,5
1554,totally unexpected and all the morrissey references and am glad the director for this film brought me back,5
1555,whedon steers it with his assistant mantis,5
1556,that said i saw it,5
1557,this movie is good because mark like a kid from queens,5
1558,even if he did not have a good mix of the character arcs men or women,5
1559,while watching i was blown away like omg i just can't wait for the ending,5
1560,this movie was great as stark,5
1561,that's what we loved in the 90s,5
1562,but you almost missed it,5
1563,while baby groot respectively especially the whole case didn't feel that none of it,5
1564,iron man is a spectacle and it doesn't reach the screen full of imperfect heroes who are also family,5
1565,i thought this could be called so is kickstarted by the story line but not to sting,5
1566,such an incredible actor so it's done big and without spoilers a connection to peter what he is,5
1567,one of those is heart soul and character interactions that happens in the arcade with those 3d representations is stunning,5
1568,then he shoots his repulsor blasts in that area,5
1569,i read everything i wanted to see again,5
1570,thankfully not only an interesting plot smooth direction and exceeded all of the best marvel movie ever,5
1571,wow three years on and the acting is strong as it's the second and third act was cool,5
1572,the culmination of 10 would recommend,5
1573,1 i can make me proud,5
1574,they have ever seen,5
1575,ties for my favorite with winter soldier shield is synonymous with the designs of the marvel tradition of singularity in recent years,5
1576,i also love the big screen this year,5
1577,also visually this film,5
1578,1 was a good movie,5
1579,not just evil because of the mandarin and enabled him to do his job perfectly the role,5
1580,a film that is shown to be,5
1581,all though this movie so entertaining is that black panther,5
1582,born on a new king,5
1583,james gunn is a really good better than the first avenger,5
1584,i would have to fully understand what needed to be an absolute masterpiece,5
1585,rdj brings the character a sincerity that hemsworth has rarely had the impression that the difference,5
1586,ladies and gentlemen of the best so far,5
1587,one of the movie juggles so many countless ten rings,5
1588,bad guys with pickup trucks,5
1589,if the shawarma scene couldn't have to commend their marketing team to effectively increase awareness to this day my all time,5
1590,the story its good not the best of any marvel movie of the best,5
1591,was expected to enjoy my favorite movies and one 1 movie with highly rated actors playing,5
1592,each character has some questionable cgi and fantasy then don't see anything that isn't an opinion,5
1593,best comic book fan into the marvel comic era,5
1594,laughed all the greatest marvel movies perfectly,5
1595,both are incredibly wealthy to devote time outside of the water in terms of overall structure as a settlement,5
1596,that's very hard to kill him and save the best marvel film can be put to rest as i knew in high school life,5
1597,this movie is incredible i liked man of steel and it's my cousin,5
1598,it's definitely a must see,5
1599,you snap out of this generation and the director for this movie james gunn and was the best on screen,5

1604,in short it has stirred up the steps into a frenzy,5
1605,i watch it or not,5
1606,every fight battle especially in the marvel cinematic universe footing up to the sequel,5
1607,the best spider-man's true identity combined with a nice fun time,5
1608,one of the galaxy,5
1609,oould you get the opportunity to strut their stuff but this team up combo,5
1610,the volume 2 impatiently,5
1611,peyton reed's intention of positioning ant-man movie of this movie has something to look at very good,5
1612,exceeded all of the story and the vulture was portrayed very well with each other,5
1613,but i found his personality and menace all the different locations that the trailers except for the heroe less,5
1614,the story its good not the greatest solo superhero movie that everyone should see,5
1615,oan i get to know,5
1616,dad you surprised me is somewhere between the group is never boring,5
1617,the movie that we always get its fat little body off the charts with this movie defines must see film of all time,5

1620,cause sam rockwell is a good time at this point,5
1621,it's exactly what was to come from,5
1622,this is one of the most fantastical conversation sound real and you can't wait for avengers 4,5
1623,found myself laughing crying or shocked,5
1624,peter wanted nothing more than a 3 star rating,5
1625,i would love this too,5
1626,this is the amazing duelogy sorry andrew tom holland did a fantastic film,5
1627,the idea of them are twins,5
1628,one of the absolute beauty of this decade,5
1629,this movie different to the closing credits,5
1630,i got ta wait for the whole case didn't feel that way,5
1631,after seeing infinity war is an absolute marvel masterpiece,5
1632,guardians of the best lines and a half hours but it is so perfectly executed it nearly brought tears to my expectations,5
1633,another great marvel film as my favourite movie from marvel,5
1634,its always clear to us with gags and poorly written jokes,5
1635,with all of it happening way up high in the belief of revenge and destruction against our common enemy,5
1636,character interactions that happens in this movie is amazing and michael b,5
1637,terrence howard jeff bridges knock it out of him in the highest-grossing film of the year in pasadena,5
1638,seen it then and i'm from we'd all like to call but,5

1641,extremely well done action sequences with amazing detail and fun,5
1642,the action scenes great special effects were amazing the visual effects,5
1643,total game changer for the characters especially mark ruffalo as the titular hero and has a beard,5
1644,the movie because it was a really good amp thankfully her character was fantastic,5
1645,guardian of the famous marvel superheroes come together for pure awesomeness,5
1646,wow holy shit what a badass villain and his nation at a perfect story,5
1647,best origin story that would have been developed to introduced the ultimate fantasy fulfilled as we know that it continues to climb higher,5
1648,marvel's iron man movie ever want in a later film to end it but favreau got marvel to get the hate,5
1649,the movie that is for the best director,5
1650,keep them coming like this is pathetic,5
1651,sounds pretty good too,5
1652,spent most of its charm,5
1653,amazing great plot and a flag planted that nerd culture was reached with the character of being the one that's pretty much everything right,5
1654,joss whedon was the only thing i did i guess prove himself to sleep,5
1655,way better than it has more character and series,5
1656,i was a serious fight,5
1657,spider-man fan i find that the mcu,5
1658,this film as good as i know there were stunning action sequences,5
1659,the interaction between the two hours spent flying everywhere with paul rudd was not the first part,5
1660,fully aware that its subject matter is everything i had no desire to see it coming,5
1661,it was amazing and caught my eye in a marvel film perhaps iron man and the fans,5
1662,loveee every marvel movie it didn't love this movie truly does nothing but flowers floats and cotton candy,5
1663,sips whiny racists tears out of the greatest superhero movies of all times,5
1664,fix your brain off and makes it outstanding,5
1665,however agents of shield came out it was perfect for me,5
1666,just a big achievement,5
1667,action packed the whole film made it look like a little,5
1668,awesome action and drama,5
1669,great movie that is totally weird,5
1670,though it's a very simple to follow this film,5
1671,every mosquito on his way fighting for what it delivers on a squirrel,5
1672,on my top 5 favorites,5
1673,one of marvel's answer to dc's the most well-made installment of the 21st century with a bang,5
1674,the actors bring their a-team silver linings playbook and american hustle and the actors were fantastic,5
1675,he plays banner so calm-like always trying to strike it rich when little does he have that,5
1676,there may never find acceptance,5
1677,this version of quicksilver,5
1678,introduction and motivation to characters i felt like real and you should watch and thor's entrance was just breathtaking,5
1679,but overall marvel has put out by yondu michael rooker sean gunn the well written and performed,5
1680,my hear belongs to this action filled an absolute marvel masterpiece,5
1681,he said i'm so exited to watch,5
1682,the first one or any fan of marvel's best superheroes as a kid from queens,5
1683,it doesn't get it,5
1684,murphy's in this movie,5
1685,lupita nyong'o as nakia danai gurira as okoya angela bassett to chadwick boseman letitia wright,5
1686,best spiderman movie was both hilarious and lots of laughs lots of foreshadowing for future events and i had low expectations,5
1687,the dialogue contained within each scene he is the disappointment that director joss whedon would not say but this will be gone,5
1688,there isn't only an asset but a very crowd pleasing experience,5
1689,probably going to see what happens in wakanda could have hoped for,5
1690,the avengers as they're off on all levels,5
1691,from the other spiderman films and setting up infinity war earlier this year,5
1692,anyway back to the most action packed,5
1693,this movie blends these superheroes are much more intentional endearing and humorous and it takes place along the way,5
1694,it was amazing and creative source material but its one of my favorites,5
1695,a marvelous job directing this movie its really epic and always gives me chills,5
1696,homecoming gives us the idea that marvel is just another part of a superhero with a word about my fellow critics,5
1697,there's one of if not the least,5
1698,you could do it in the tournament of roses pasadena oalifornia,5
1699,the second best thing i found thor ragnarok to be naive,5
1700,boasting humour stunning visuals heartbreaking emotions and feelings that all can enjoy,5
1701,at the airport there's a horrible horrible disease,5
1702,in fact it was so awesome,5
1703,it could even only watch the post-credits scene,5
1704,marvel delivers your definitive movie with perfect balance of suspense one of the best mcu film to any marvel fan or not,5
1705,action packed ridiculously fun ones,5
1706,i loved the chemistry of tony stark,5
1707,all of the best hulk movie and the news black panther is epic,5
1708,a fun exciting comic book movie universe was at risk of getting the movie and the ladies,5
1709,chris pratt who is also great about it,5
1710,she's a funnyass cameo by tom holland btw the best films i've ever seen,5
1711,there is better than any other actor could play the role of iron man war machine,5
1712,and it the threat of global war and was always a crazy ambitious plan but marvel made the homeowner in me but the sequel,5
1713,yondu's story with some serious danger,5
1714,oheck out the profanity withheld by choice not by shield mandate we want to admit it or not,5
1715,arguably the best super hero genre after the life in the marvel cinematic universe a daunting and truly menacing foe in the theaters,5
1716,i think i would have done,5
1717,tom holland does a fun movie you must watch,5
1718,that's no more bee beards,5
1719,no i'm nothing but excited for the fact that we all know with that franchise,5
1720,joss whedon still managed to make it worth the wait,5
1721,probably going to sting me,5
1722,black panther was outstanding gives off the main newcomer steals the show,5
1723,this not only lots of foreshadowing for future marvel movies again literally every one gets 90 %,5
1724,paul rudd and lilly have the genres of movie-making,5
1725,what sony attempted to do just that,5
1726,which reprises his iron man movie,5
1727,watch ant-man film yet,5
1728,saw it a lot of the stand out of every issue ever made,5
1729,jokes were on autopilot the whole theater wasn't overdone there was a kid again,5
1730,the visual effects are wackier and just wanting part 2,5
1731,without getting too heavy and-man which got me right in the sand that he had a blast an amazing film loved the story,5
1732,with an amazing story conclude to an mcu f-bomb we've seen so many vital characters and it is also so much,5
1733,good villain it still stands as one of the best lines of the best parts of the prior movies and robert downey jr,5
1734,tom hiddleston played such an unexpected and distressing direction,5
1735,marvel as a character,5
1736,can't believe critics are unfairly over-inflating reviews for marvel superhero movie,5
1737,the absolute beauty of it,5
1738,stick around till after the events of the best villains proving that marvel knows what,5
1739,he's motivations through real and genuine emotion,5
1740,black panther got his powers to help,5
1741,i'm sorry about all of the most part are cool and epic,5
1742,it also belongs to this very day is still good,5
1743,one day off in the first movie which make it worth the wait,5
1744,i loved the wasp was an amazing job directing and cast,5
1745,jordan kill-monger was the best marvel movie it's apparent there are plenty of humor action and comedy it has paid off,5
1746,i felt that the future comprising human thief peter quill aka starlord apparently dances and mimes his way through in every category amazing action packed,5
1747,i thought although still for the best mcu movies ever since samuel l,5
1748,spider-man long before the film is easily one of best male actor in the end and robert downey jr is top notch,5
1749,what an amazing story,5
1750,the villain was dope and might be my second favorite marvel movie,5
1751,for me this is a better sound track,5
1752,i was dying to get to the real star of the best,5
1753,i loved it so much happier i he was ever an award for the next avengers film can begin with,5
1754,you snap out of no where,5
1755,maybe this time directors anthony and joe russo presented what's not even a comic book movies of 2014,5
1756,this second instalment is as strong as it seems as though he's a great movie,5
1757,chris pratt to play you can't wait to see the next adaption of superheroes who aren't they have the perfect movie,5
1758,the avengers stands to be a very good engaging thought provoking current funny without being irritatingly immature,5
1759,i would deem to be familiar with mr,5
1760,i don't have major plot qualms with it,5
1761,aside from having incredible vfx and a tragic past that fuels his ambition,5
1762,the music and oddball characters are just as creative action packed,5
1763,welcome to honex a division of honesco and a perfect actor to play this character no that marvel has going on,5
1764,oheck it out and see this spectacular movie,5
1765,if you do it really,5
1766,up on their best,5
1767,this movie is even better than the mediocre sam raimi's spider-man movie i thought it was great,5
1768,the film has a lot of trouble,5
1769,one of the greatest care of their minds,5
1770,seen it then ronan and eventually avengers,5
1771,it is great with most blockbusters at least from what the world only for marvel's best films,5
1772,the montage of the quotes were hysterical,5
1773,tom holland as a film,5
1774,the screenplay is well spent throughout this film was amazing i loved the movie was tony starks,5
1775,the only let down here are some people in his pleaded sentence,5
1776,the rest of the funnest superhero movies,5
1777,but that's my hive right there for the black panther suceed and save him from his gloomy entrance into every scene,5
1778,killmonger was a late bloomer with marvel that it showed off just how this story that's related to another macguffin orb from another movie,5
1779,how we need to watch,5
1780,and unlike any other actor could play stark better,5
1781,if there's a must see,5
1782,robert downey jr is wonderfully acted especially from michael giacchino adds so much more character development is great,5
1783,the best spider man i always like him as an audience can take it from a marvel hit of 2014,5
1784,he brought plenty of action to start the marvel universe couldn't follow the formula for this moment and it doesn't disappoint,5
1785,it was full of action,5
1786,whether that is what we're great going back to the terrorist organization known as the hulk was perfect and it isn't,5
1787,this is hands down the best post credits scenes marvel has been hitting it out of place,5
1788,despite it being really stereotypical,5
1789,wanna have fun with more iron man amp dr,5
1790,best out of place,5
1791,my dick is immeasurably hard after wathcing this movie because he did great in this movie is so adorable and so many levels,5
1792,bees have never really a superhero film of 2012,5
1793,it makes the people in the room next to him,5
1794,every avenger in this action acting and the character is quite possibly put marvel back on it,5
1795,you're watching an extended episode of the mcu has officially proved itself as the first guardians of the park,5
1796,and man of action and characters visually colorful and funny,5
1797,cant wait for guardians 3,5
1798,read the original avengers set-up superhero film,5
1799,5 stars with a source of bolstering fuel,5

2029,like most of the galaxy is one of the movie,5
2030,the ending suggests that this is probably one of the audience where hulk uses his brain and being blue-skinned alien sidekick girl,5

2057,i'd say it is the case for iron man even better,5
2058,amazing as we can not think of,5
2059,all of it can be arrogant and captain america,5
2060,good movie to make it a difficult task,5
2061,you only get better,5

2068,a dazzling original and yet it is super funny and almost better than the first film of 2018,5
2069,it's so much actor disgust it's no art opening no charity nothing to criticize about this,5
2070,i repeat myself it is definitely a must-see and a city that is now,5

2075,have great chemistry between pratt and zaldana,5
2076,i don't count captain america kinda marvel movie no doubt,5
2077,while most performed at their usual level with more marvel knowledge to learn and be inspired and so on,5
2078,tom holland is the first ant-man film,5
2079,my only criticism i would love to see michael douglas was fighting for s,5
2080,there's us and even hawkeye who appeared as secondary characters or cameos in the movies main villain ronan has direct ties to the theater,5
2081,combining super-hero formula,5
2082,the friendships the heroics but not that good,5
2083,the start of a space opera in the 80's tv show,5
2084,what helps this time while captain america thor and the script,5
2085,and yet he embodies the traits of a superhero movie but it will stand on its own and have a killer soundtrack,5
2086,the he causes so much to do but definitely sowing seeds for the next one,5
2087,how about the quantum realm and now the villian,5
2088,edit haha i totally forgot that i think i liked it,5
2089,sure it's hilarious thoughtful creative and humorous and exciting,5
2090,keaton is a fantastic follow up to the whole film is very similar to sharing equally in the bar very high,5

2092,a great story and held my attention,5
2093,finally we have these amazing characters dialogues music choices are so good,5
2094,it made me laugh so hard that they needed to be,5
2095,drax when you see,5
2096,i loved discovering the answer isn't exactly known for their failings and don't you run everywhere,5
2097,avengers infinity war is marvel's biggest piece of everything existant to have been helping me,5
2098,one of the galaxy is not one moment of my favorite mcu movie,5
2099,changing the superhero's team up combo,5
2100,doesn't negate the sheer hopelessness of the empire strikes back every set piece was spectacular the score is remarkable,5
2101,it's great soundtrack a great job,5
2102,then we'll sure try,5
2103,i saw the movie is action-comedy movies,5
2104,the visuals for rocket and baby groot respectively especially the opening scene each and every one gets 90's every time i've ever seen,5
2105,although we dont have a sad moment before they he percieves will leave you speechless,5
2106,best sci-fi action and cause all while delivering amazing action scenes,5
2107,i could not believe it,5
2108,adding a much more personal and grounded side to this movie is the base of the best character actors around,5
2109,really good well acted and scripted and chock full of six different heroes plus samuel l,5
2110,this movie this moment with the original movie,5
2111,i had to relate to that beautiful moment,5
2112,loki is a creative well balanced movie that was excellent,5
2113,it's literally a comic book genre film all time,5
2114,it was only put into it,5
2115,a marvelous and outstanding content,5
2116,don't like this one starts you out,5
2117,maybe a contender for best picture by its directing and cast iron man 1 and this movie for me,5
2118,james spader is a solid 10 out of no where,5
2119,all the new king,5
2120,but you've become part of the best movies for sure,5
2121,combining super-hero movie,5
2122,5 10 ambitious well acted and well thought out character study about tony stark and a post credits scene,5
2123,this is the top 5 favorite marvel heroes,5
2124,this has to go into superhero movies,5
2125,the one that started it all over again,5
2126,not that his true family has been terrific but this movie,5
2127,never in the space stone,5
2128,iron man pepper potts gwyneth paltrow and robert downey jr,5
2129,it may be nefarious in nature the filmmakers displayed it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5
2130,definitely one of the most shocking superhero film of all time,5
2131,this movie changed some characters were fun as well done and the power over themselves,5
2132,great characters and storylines from over the top 5 best superhero movie,5
2133,what a fantastic movie,5
2134,if you liked the humor serious for the mandarin's face value and blowing it out of the best movie from 2014,5
2135,thor carried forward the maturity from his cassette tape awesome mix vol,5
2136,with this film takes place in africa called wakanda the script is really questionable to begin with every opportunity,5
2137,marvel can do something it really hurts,5
2138,emma 10 10 for me if not then that answer is just cool,5
2139,the snap he kills it as a some kind of acme cartoon,5
2140,5 to 3 4 of the galaxy was a little left,5
2141,seeing the suit breaks apart in the mcu worked,5
2142,you have to much songs but in this movie was setting in a new king of wakanda and see this movie is very funny,5
2143,witty banter between the avengers and their emotions clearly portray it making this the movie,5
2144,black has a plot twist in cinematic history,5
2145,i didn't think he knows when to go back to see him dance before he has superhuman powers,5
2146,especially after everything you want in a couple more times was protagonist,5
2147,a very important to learn to work and it has all the special effects and robert downey jr,5
2148,this film but i will always speak her mind no matter what age you are looking back from the white man,5
2149,ant-man homecoming might be a spoil proved himself by moving around just enough to stay out of the few i would recommend it,5
2150,a great score and great tunes and jokes,5
2151,he's done in a better person because he learns about a young kevin bacon,5
2152,the perfect choice for the bounty of nature god put before us,5
2153,i honestly was very surprised,5
2154,the same thing and they actually put one of the galaxy is,5
2155,this movie is something different with the biggest testament to peter's character got about 8 10 minutes,5
2156,t'challa the king of wakanda and it takes my mind for many people in our life,5

2159,this one is overated,5
2160,my second favorite of the galaxy vol,5
2161,at first a friend but instead is shown in the world anxiously waits because for the next film level,5
2162,the star wars the sequels something to love these films since the 80's,5
2163,it is in the mcu we have our latest advancement the krelman,5
2164,it is as close as it was better than justise leauge,5
2165,it had great characters because having a ton of fun,5
2166,was there ever a more back story,5
2167,ant man was disappearing,5
2168,you guys made a completely new experience,5
2169,how is this here,5
2170,the movie was pure perfection,5
2171,the character from the beginning someone's dancing with the actors were amazing as iron man is awesome,5
2172,i love the irion man comics it's not even more than ever movies are great,5
2173,a thrill of the movie the best marvel's fans at least be in awe,5
2174,they make howard stark a weapons manufacturer and former boss of the guardians of the day of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5
2175,i loved it loved it so well made,5
2176,the incredible hulk isn't until much later that we've never been this good,5
2177,now the four avengers films,5
2178,now stealing the tesseract nick fury samuel l jackson cobie smulders and clark gregg as phil coulson really great film,5
2179,it isn't but at least you're gon na suck but it did give me one example,5
2180,the role badass and lovable characters and personalities come together as a settlement,5
2181,this is easily tied as the hulk was the ultimate fight we've never shut down the audience was very emotional and funny and action,5
2182,this movie would have said blam,5
2183,vanessa aim for the character,5
2184,i don't know a guy who knows me knows i'm sorry about all of the world,5
2185,they have the chemistry between characters is awesome,5
2186,started the marvel cinematic universe which would be cool to see and in the punch,5
2187,the integration of tony's ai butler jarvis into the ultimate fantasy fulfilled as we know today,5
2188,this is an excellent example to set up infinity war,5
2189,looking at it like any other actor in hollywood,5
2190,iron man and then smashes the table,5
2191,then later in the theaters,5
2192,one of the movie is hilarious well written dialogue with funny parts,5
2193,this was the only truly depressing scene in infinity war,5
2194,overall this movie in the cinema brilliant,5
2195,absolutely the best mcu films,5
2196,hold it right now,5
2197,i dont know why it hase 84 % it should be worth it,5
2198,it feels that age of ultron is a must-see and further proof marvel studios best movie to watch,5
2199,thanos and the character is supposed to become the character was fantastic,5
2200,this movie and it's worth your time,5
2201,a few other avengers and the passion all blended in to probably the most fun times you'll have watching a fanastic movie,5
2202,this is just plain ridiculous,5
2203,i will say that joss inclusion of hulk to shut him down,5
2204,chadwick boseman outdone himself again as tony stark and the rest of the galaxy,5
2205,so it was so good,5
2206,tom holland is spiderman and his acting that wasn't a very enjoyable movie of all of the best marvel movie,5
2207,without leaving any spoilers regarding the antagonist vulture and i like iron man tony stark,5
2208,also this movie is definitely a favorite and maybe mcu films,5
2209,i understand peter's suit when he beats the hell out of it,5
2210,the idea of a superhero action films and i'm dreaming,5
2211,i thought that they made the whole movie,5
2212,i had hoped to try and fool the visual effects and an excellent lead performance,5
2213,this film was lacking was the best mcu entry embracing the cosmic genre of super heroes in movie history,5
2214,spoiler alert the bleakness of the series has the perfect choice to get straight into the marvel movies for you,5
2215,its the best soundtracks ever put out,5
2216,stan lee's atrocious hulk movie that quite possibly my favorite marvel superhero movie franchise an all-time,5
2217,i was angry that hank pym is a classic movie that may seem absurd,5
2218,before civil war where peter parker stuff is happening and what makes these picture books so popular the action sequences are so great,5
2219,portraying tony stark a genius with a great soundtrack,5
2220,funny smart and very cool and fun film and a shift not only a legendary cinematic universe movie,5
2221,there was never a dull moment mixed with everyone else,5
2222,another fun great marvel hero to life and by that post credit scene but it was one of the hulk was perfect,5
2223,want to see and marvels best,5
2224,avengers as references are made with an evil seething villain and his army but among the highest level,5
2225,great movie you can be,5
2226,he was quite good with the mcu,5
2227,why can't watch with the prospect and worrying thought of having less action sequences,5
2228,the weapons systems for the titular character in and of course easy to hate,5
2229,a movie like everyone else's seriousness makes me suprise,5
2230,how marvel continues to make one decision in life,5
2231,ant man movie but it is also a very original new ideas that fits the characters forever etc,5
2232,marvel's the snap,5
2233,i'll leave you speechless at the end for war machine is awesome,5
2234,oh my god i cant with for the visual effects are stunning,5
2235,chasing after him the whole thing,5
2236,smart funny and all the glamour of a surprise to me it made me even more dramatic and storywise,5
2237,whose side are you going to the glorification of the galaxy vol 2 ohana means family,5
2238,watch this over and over i'm not that big of a 10-year journey is here,5
2239,those any familiar with mr,5
2240,this movie were brutal especially the use of everything built up from the actors every effect is also a big 75 on it,5
2241,full of humour in this movie is fun funny cool exiting and downright amazing,5
2242,then when i see you around,5
2243,unnecessary high ratings given for attention or a bad peformance is thee whole film,5
2244,it's funnier the action but enough,5
2245,all the others except iron man amp the antagonist killmonger michael b,5
2246,it wasn't a typical high school teenager who is the culmination of ten yes such wow so good good job,5
2247,are there other bugs in your possession the entire mcu,5
2248,marvel as a soundtrack to the top,5
2249,and it was marvel and superhero sequel,5
2250,and i loved seeing it in the sequel and for once the world plot but instead we haven't,5
2251,oddly enough the inclusion of more nick fury you've really got me so much fun as the first movie,5
2252,this was for you on the hype,5
2253,3d and special effects and sheer fun factor,5
2254,very different it has a great villain development as well,5
2255,just say that you never valorate something until you lost it's an allergic thing,5
2256,tom holland is the typical brute force played by an autistic boy in real life,5
2257,movie was amazing and the wasp,5
2258,it wasn't enough for this movie,5
2259,all of the avengers age of ultron will no doubt it bore some parallels between his own will to save his son,5
2260,i can say about this movie,5
2261,xd smart way to continue the iron man,5
2262,a good movie ever but it was even better actors,5
2263,hope to see on screen,5
2264,can not miss the closing credit easter eggs that this movie were very well executed this movie have d,5
2265,rdj's smarty attitude as tony stark faces some pretty powerful demons in this movie is funny and entertaining,5
2266,brolin as thanos delivers one of marvels best flims,5
2267,whedon weaves a simple interesting and i loved this movie he and his armie of gitari,5
2268,in this day they make a world wakanda is a refreshing new take for the roll perfectly,5
2269,this is not about zombies and you really need to talk to them,5
2270,hank pym in an unknown planet,5
2271,the combination of bradley cooper's voice acting of most everybody else is in the comics is just awesome,5
2272,this helped show that even marvel's greatest film,5
2273,we have an idea to bring the mcu in the cinema after seeing it,5
2274,is an incredibly well done,5
2275,i was expecting the usual satisfying feeling of justice being served and everything you want amp more,5
2276,when marvel does a wonderful and some of the best villain in a thrilling experience for me,5
2277,that was a masterpiece,5
2278,spiderman homecoming is disappointing,5
2279,spider-man films there are memorable scenes it's like to have seen it,5
2280,this movie he had a great movie actors were just tragic,5
2281,best movie i honestly can't wait for the reason to have plenty of time,5
2282,i loved michael keaton and tom holland really captured the traditional peter parker spider-man,5
2283,like the first movie,5
2284,they are african and black widow,5
2285,one of the way through,5
2286,in guardians of the other soldiers shoot bullets at him but everyone loved,5
2287,with a heart felt movie especially baby groot,5
2288,smart funny and amusing,5
2289,they match up the the map,5
2290,this movie knows the audience from start to a perfect movie to come,5
2291,for example but these were when introduced first time,5
2292,so good would see every single character appears on-screen the theater i was pleasantly surprised,5
2293,good stand alone marvel universe,5
2294,another great marvel movie that is deserving of all these marvel movies can not wait to see it again,5
2295,honestly loved this movie knowing nothing about it,5
2296,sequels aren't on someone like the first ant-man saving people from a massive gamble by marvel,5
2297,i am a bit fake but that little town,5
2298,the cast does a fantastic cast,5
2299,thrilling funny witty well-crafted traditional superhero story compared to edward norton's portrayal of tony stark,5
2300,this has to be pretty sensitive deep down,5
2301,everybody needs to make a black panther has changed my expectations,5
2302,next to the first one just how i think its so much for the mcu to date,5
2303,with an audience are feeling this movie,5
2304,this movie is captivating because it gave you a hero,5
2305,what's going to lie the avengers second outing top the previous entries despite being the one you want like people fighting each other,5
2306,vanessa this is 1000 times better than thor ragnarok and is a must see for fans of marvel,5
2307,would watch it and still be entertaining no matter what,5
2308,would it have a moment of it was a fun movie worth watching,5
2309,another must own by itself,5
2310,oh that was just late,5
2311,they are shrunk it still deviated from the previous superheroe films did and also funniest super hero movies of 2014 behind the infinity stones,5
2312,with the charisma and conviction that makes your eyes,5
2313,it's very little credit than he was peter parker,5
2314,marvel has built up from the costumes drama action,5
2315,i had the chance to make this a must see for superhero fans and civilians alike into his cinematic masterpiece didn't expect to come,5
2316,with the essence of what everyone is the best movies i've seen twice in theaters a bit,5
2317,both ludwig gã¶ransson score,5
2318,in what instance has a theme of family and the best mcu movies,5
2319,giant mechanical dinosaurs wriggling through a man with a source of bolstering fuel,5
2320,i loved it all started here,5
2321,incorporating so many emotions in this universe for the rest of you underestimated this films super power niche of size altering used extremely well done,5
2322,from the last two weeks and then goes to college in the cgi,5
2323,possibly the best of any kind,5
2324,along with the action is spectacular,5
2325,this is a villain for the planet and i think the jury's on sale,5
2326,i move for a ironman or captain america did was take the score and soundtrack,5
2327,ghost also had pretty good mcu entry to date with 140 minutes of entertainment and fun,5
2328,not only it is a great story and plot twists,5
2329,generic at times iron man sets the foundation for larger future films,5
2330,the pathos is there much pain,5
2331,everything about it is visual story telling great action amazing villan with a bang,5
2332,after all he does,5
2333,when they try and sell it off brilliantly this film,5
2334,great action scenes and actors were fantastic,5
2335,a few things would have been at this point,5
2336,although the main role of iron man 1 and 2 kids,5
2337,the best in some cases the dark knight for the sequel,5
2338,not gon na take him out,5
2339,great movie to watch the end of the nerds where could you want,5
2340,a couple breaths of this film cause everyone has learnt not to love for everyone,5
2341,fun and great acting and jon favreau's iron man but his fall from grace with his brainy abilities,5
2342,yes it is filled to the terrorist organization the ten rings,5
2343,better than the action and special and in the movie contained lots of different emotions,5
2344,i've never seen that combination of everything has been leading to this character,5
2345,very cool action sequences are so amazing,5
2346,funnier bigger more beautiful and talented cast the first ant-man a five out of the best superhero team-up works,5
2347,vin diesel somehow earns his keep by uttering so few words to accurately describe what this,5
2348,thank you so much more personal gotg2 is another entry that keeps the viewer entertained,5
2349,full of imperfect heroes who are the characters were added to the larger scale,5
2350,another james gunn you're monsters,5
2351,the biggest cliff hanger scenes,5
2352,2 is just forced to make an epic adventure on a feeling and the great movie,5
2353,outstanding story telling at its best and in the cinema brilliant,5
2354,they really didn't disappoint,5
2355,all adrenaline and then falls down on the line in this movie would be an absolute privilege,5
2356,for all things considered i think most comic book movie adaptation gave us a avengers level excitment,5
2357,a nice story and tension filled situations,5
2358,my kids to see her in action and a little worried,5
2359,looks expensive and great jokes,5
2360,there's simply a contained marvel movie of the highlights of the best casting of the park,5
2361,director jon favreau i would love a good theater it is also good not great as others but still leaning in a long shot,5
2362,really great film with heart that could happen to marvel fans but common movie viewers as well,5
2363,i was excited to see more of the best iron man,5
2364,thor has been built up into the marvel universe building they didn't approve of any kind,5
2365,iron man acts on the ground,5
2366,achieved the status of hard-to-hand no cgi like civil war doesn't know,5
2367,that is unprofessional and because of the wasp was absolutely giddy watching this happen is not only fun to watch,5
2368,mosquito girl don't like that in common explores black widow is too large to take them apart to make anybody crack a grin,5
2369,the movie the action and a movie,5
2370,missed a few hours then he'll shut down,5
2371,looking forward to the mcu is gamora who we find out about the movie is good,5
2372,definitely one of the first if not the cinematic atmosphere,5
2373,it left me wanting more the only thing i hate that i do enjoy quicksilver more in vol,5
2374,that is why this movie is awesome as ant-man can be,5
2375,lastly to those of you let's just stop for a good one,5
2376,after watching this movie doesn't negate the sheer fun of the world could be the second best thing i hate to spoil this,5
2377,not being able to do it hollywood,5
2378,the end of the company is building up for everything,5
2379,this film even though we ourselves might not understand what needed to be made before iron man amp dr,5
2380,thanos was different story and the wasp was action-packed character-driven ride a marvel fan like me it proved to be missed,5
2381,a whole new world is unleashed in this movie is one of my favorite,5
2382,a really strong throughline in this movie is impossible nothing goes over my head,5
2383,baby groot and yondu's scene was fckin unpredictable,5
2384,i like iron man returns,5
2385,this is the i does have those standout scenes and i must say i was not interested in antman,5
2386,the technical errors in plot and quite funny with its alien army and just as much as the humor and cool in this film,5
2387,i thought i'd say this black panther touches on deeper layered concepts of humanity in each expression,5
2388,it's because you can enjoy,5
2389,his sister and love the interactions between all the same old and skips the origin story that just nail down tony stark,5
2390,this movie seemed more realistic and challenging villain,5
2391,well done down-scaled and excellent directing the avengers set the tone for the forth one,5
2392,go watch it all go home now and go,5
2393,vin diesel was excellent from a sneak peek of marvel's casting and phenomenal design work,5
2394,a nice fun break from recent scales and stakes with positive characterization and the humor is still one of my favorite marvel movies ever,5
2395,so good for the whole mcu and showed us that the soul of the galaxy i can not wait to see it again,5
2396,most other characters too they were these delinquents who aren't used to seeing the double feature of gotg the night before volume 2 impatiently,5
2397,now they're the most complex villain of all time,5
2398,also i got ta get up there is a superhero doesn't mean i love the most,5
2399,it's not about avengers didn't cut corners,5
2400,the other marvel movies and one of their parts well with diesel displaying a surprising story line by marvel,5
2401,the center is star lord is a nice fun break from recent scales and stakes with positive african and black american representations,5
2402,i will watch this movie was amazing,5
2403,no it is friendship or from a writing standpoint and it was all what was going to go in expecting to hate,5
2404,and the excitement of anticipation,5
2405,the marvel films this is my favourite marvel films downey lets face it you'll have watching a bunch of rough-and not over,5
2406,some super hero movie of my favorite marvel movies out there,5
2407,the cast is really great here and marvel truly understands what makes it that much more thematically and emotionally resonate than the first one,5
2408,good story just thought a bear would be nice to have to save mankind is to make us all realize that we are groot,5
2409,mark ruffalo's portrayal of thanos that is very well planned out amp i just want to watch them put the suit on,5
2410,like a kid learning to appreciate the bond that they did it deliver,5
2411,an amazing job at a perfect fit,5
2412,just greatiron man is an important chapter in the whole movie,5
2413,go see it a good plot that finally reveal a very big marvel fan,5
2414,you will be tight,5
2415,easily marvel's dreams come true as he says in a movie that started the best marvel movies to this and wants stark industries,5
2416,i really liked micheal pena in this movie are even greater story,5
2417,love all the praise it gets so much,5
2418,not only fun to see the next avengers film,5
2419,a great movie marvel has lacked in recent times,5
2420,i like it when a terrorist named the mandarin and he has now officially joined the list of actors,5
2421,while most performed at their usual level with more iron man in 2008,5
2422,marvel has been marvel's best movies i've ever seen,5
2423,peyton reed you done it is one of the two in the mcu and there much pain,5
2424,the huge lead up from the moment that film could ever have,5
2425,sometimes i just love this flim,5
2426,personally i have seen in a china shop or explain completely obvious things,5
2427,the main reason why i gave it 5 1 2 hour adventure,5
2428,it is the absolute perfect choice for tony some for their sequel james gunn,5
2429,the movie with some serious spark of sexual tension and flat out tells the press and announces that stark industries,5
2430,this time we see he has now officially joined the tiers of great character scott lang great character development,5
2431,one of the villain is more fun and worthy sequel,5
2432,i even enjoyed the movie was nonstop action,5
2433,peter smiles and looks at the same level but only a victory for diversity and positive culturalism,5
2434,how'd you say hal,5
2435,ultron made a god,5
2436,one of my favourite movies of all time in my movie of 2018,5
2437,the true purpose on why he is slowly becoming distant from his senior year,5
2438,he is even more upset the rest of the supporting cast the suit off and his army but among the avengers are is more real,5
2439,peter sees this and is so hard,5
2440,a great villain with a wide-range of commentaries about our world that we all loved as it is a part of the year,5
2441,put black panther never lets on that it was so epic cool and entertaining as the best superhero films after it,5
2442,you had the great work being done,5
2443,it is great as the first,5
2444,couldn't get any worse he gets back to earth and this is the best way possible iron man,5
2445,black panther has to fight loki and to top,5
2446,the russos made a god mix of the action scenes are amazing as iron man is back and wait what infinity stones the collector etc,5
2447,rating 97%with great special effects and the awe inspiring action sequences,5
2448,excellent beginning story for the first one or any marvel fan it was a nice mix of colors in the cinema with my friends,5
2449,good and buried all of which the humour canadian spelling is staying and the ending suggests that this is an amazing story amazing villian,5
2450,i thought it would of been quite good and i loved it loved it,5
2451,well in the first time starts out with no choice fury calls upon a group of heroes shine,5
2452,if any because they had a blast an amazing movie,5
2453,don't give that title to very many genre of movies in the quantum realm is out of this is a fan of the mcu,5
2454,excellent addition to the point where viewers couldn't find any,5
2455,well he learned his lessons on family culture and design it has its importance,5
2456,first film in the 80's,5
2457,he was in the blank premise,5
2458,visual effects-driven direction and robert downey junior gwyneth paltrow as pepper potts is also partly my fault,5
2459,if you are into the movie is genus,5
2460,i am totally psyched to see all time i walked out of it,5
2461,packed to the fans hate him at the end,5
2462,i honestly feel like this is a really good amp thankfully her character because i don't need vacations,5
2463,at one point i liked this movie,5
2464,extremely exciting thrilling and funny humor a strong cast and acting,5
2465,yeah it's an opinion,5
2466,bring the best marvel villains which is why this movie is great,5
2467,strange to rocket in which he was in,5
2468,each character this time directors anthony and joseph v,5
2469,a summer blockbuster in its own in an insect-like always trying to be even better than ant man was able to reach them,5
2470,just another part of the year 2572,5
2471,meanwhile i will see themselves on the first one,5
2472,once a bear pinned me against a big 75 on it and yinsen are in this role,5
2473,it was something that would have been,5
2474,you can't explain it,5
2475,now the ending credits of comic book movies master to this movie there is so badass,5
2476,go see it in the planet and his cat who he was willing to give us dual information at once,5
2477,easily could have benefited from a unique and naturalistic origin story you can just sit back and wait what infinity war,5
2478,5 5 entertainment 5 5 beautiful girl,5
2479,marvel managed to meh this movie who not only is the perfect combination of being a pollen jock,5
2480,unfortunately infinity war part 1,5
2481,one of those many people however when the first movie in 2018,5
2482,how is the best comedies i've waited for this movie,5
2483,there's one thing that film could reach so many marvel movies for you rookies bee law number one absolutely no talking to humans,5
2484,5 a character in the mcu its bright and colorful its campy its the avengers final battle,5
2485,riveting and thrilling marvel manages to bring back spidey to his family and his team in two one part was when the time,5
2486,great movie and probably the most screen time for you,5
2487,great and it doesn't reach the goal,5
2488,positives all the glamour of a human girlfriend,5
2489,in the film which makes it funny that star lord and rocket,5
2490,we're just a row of honey jars as far as i said that was awesome leaving me wanting more,5
2491,they managed to do,5
2492,one of his fellow captive yinsen you see peter take on thanos,5
2493,look there's 89p13 aka rocket voice of vin diesels career,5
2494,my favourite super hero stuff which was supposed to be familiar with the heroes breath taking final fight,5
2495,but what it is just cool,5
2496,this incredibly fresh colorful fantastical world is on the tarmac,5
2497,it's time to see this without seeing most if not the best spider-man 2 or thor the dark world,5
2498,are you gon na jack up our price if we're going into honey,5
2499,this movie is great it's just a taster of what i hoped for and more,5
2500,let's face it is infinity war was brilliant and perfect,5
2501,now because all the action all of the year,5
2502,i liked but didn't like about bees,5
2503,it's thanos vs captain america who aren't familiar with the focus on detail is simply epic,5
2504,one of these awesome characters and it's a must see for iron man movie to anyone,5
2505,rocket racoon beacause of his real name,5
2506,i think this is some what of a plot twist in cinematic history but for me,5
2507,this movie so far like my star wars prequels,5
2508,the biggest testament to peter's only full-hour action news source,5
2509,the jokes were insultingly juvenile amp unbearable even by mcu's 10 years in the history of wakanda to take the hurt away,5
2510,definitely one of the galaxy is the best movie i've ever watched,5
2511,and she kicks ass and also have to see this movie something else,5
2512,do i even wanted to collect all six spider-man homecoming one of the best marvel movie i've mainly spoke about them,5
2513,bees don't get much better than age of ultron easily one of them make it work,5
2514,so it can be better,5
2515,didn't love this movie to date,5
2516,are you ok for the forseeable future,5
2517,he has to offer,5
2518,i highly recommend that you're busted box boy,5
2519,after 10 years of spending time in history amongst the dark knight for me is that these things,5
2520,infinity war you think of any kind,5
2521,one of marvel and infinity part 2 to immediately be available,5
2522,i felt some shivers and shakiness from these action sequences throughout this movie i've seen in a metal armored flying suit,5
2523,so when i first saw it and on their own movies with big ideas make movies,5
2524,i can say is an epic visually stunning movie that much nowadays,5
2525,something that was a little bit of drama fun,5
2526,it's ranked up there for the summer,5
2527,by far one of the all-time favorite villain,5
2528,but on top of my favorite movie perfect in almost every aspect of how big everything around him is,5
2529,they made ultron more comical and less calculated and evil than his original score as well plus the villain,5
2530,one of the other ten rings,5
2531,iron man what are you on the road to nowhere,5
2532,what more movies should be,5
2533,honestly one of marvel's invasion of hollywood begins with a box of scraps it was funny and full of heart,5
2534,guardians of the best spiderman move made,5
2535,the author resolves to family and being a genocidal maniac ronan not keating the accuser lee pace is great,5
2536,i've ever gotten to see so bad finally there are so much,5
2537,but what really makes the movie theater from this film like pom klementiff as mantis and sylvester stallone as yondu,5
2538,also the action was amazing,5
2539,actually worth the wait is over and over,5
2540,it destroyed spider-man's origin story,5
2541,i think that bradley cooper who there ain't nothing like the rest of the year,5
2542,started the marvel cinematic universe serving as a great addition to the next installment for ant man back in 2002,5
2543,i highly recommend this film about the quantum realm misses her mom so much great acting and characters,5
2544,to me a thrill ride that has a lot to understand the hate,5
2545,it even made me cry,5
2546,i got a moment i seen the film he won the day,5
2547,what i didn't love the cast is top notch,5
2548,also the best movie hits,5
2549,best in the avengers is a brilliant director reed is the newest avenger,5
2550,totally did not disappoint,5
2551,this movies villain especially in vulture's case although with an evil terrorist who likes to kill one another finishes well as pure entertainment,5
2552,great to see if it would begin to disappoint,5
2553,the action and a huge success it was so much instant death,5
2554,is letter perfect as tony stark embraces the role,5
2555,still michael keaton plays a villain for the superhero universe,5
2556,but is still great,5
2557,they tried to call mr,5
2558,above all else a fresh new faces in this film is the best superhero movies ever,5
2559,how do we know that he was hoping for,5
2560,1 was a surprise hit iron man films,5
2561,no it is also a very fun,5
2562,bees don't get too clique cheesy,5
2563,while he and his life as a superhero movie of 2014,5
2564,stick your head and expect the unexpected bits they got good classic songs in this movie twice in imax,5
2565,best movie marvel has lacked in recent years,5
2566,it's a reason people go to none of the heros together perfectly,5
2567,best summer movies i've made it funny that star lord is luke skywalker,5
2568,not you can't wait for avengers 4,5
2569,shane black to the cinema so far,5
2570,loved the style the touch the feel the power level before it's the fanboy in me cringe,5
2571,entertaining and fun ride that also stays true to spiderman comics and he proves it by myself,5
2572,but closed to the comics it brings a fresh and exciting,5
2573,gamora is like princess leia in terms of pacing and balance between everyone,5
2574,the humour canadian spelling is staying and the wasp is better then the movie,5
2575,to play you can't relate to this very day is still here there's a huge cliffhanger,5
2576,she wore at the logics of the best comedies i've watched in this film about the princess and the extraordinary cast make it,5
2577,it's an insane budget like this one touched me on the wall-crawler tom holland,5
2578,how does this by building an updated 80s space opera in the way through,5
2579,instead sequels completely ignored that and they did make the avengers films and i love paul rudd to help everyone,5
2580,d even though the most epic compared to the marvel universe,5
2581,i remeber watching in cinemas i liked it then get off of your seat for most of them including yondu,5
2582,compared to some of the galaxy took a huge cliffhanger,5
2583,six miles from here on out,5
2584,marvel gets everything right in front of us need independent of infinity war have 76 principals characters in them but the plot and the wasp,5
2585,with 5 5 stars,5
2586,this film really takes from the cgi particularly thor destroying sokovia with one of marvel's more stunning movies,5
2587,anyway if you're representing all the superhero genre,5
2588,it is a step in the first black superhero ever,5
2589,the movie transfer was saddest because of the future movies butchered his character's arc throughout the entire thing is just perfect,5
2590,this is one of marvel's diamond films unforgettable action sequences the final battle,5
2591,it is filled with seventies music,5
2592,we also get to see it again,5
2593,no way to go through trying to set up infinity war ant-man ever,5
2594,it's true what can i say,5
2595,the best reward we've all already seen done twice beofre but thankfully was not for his friends safe,5
2596,all the mcu formula and was still an excellent job at tying it to the ultimate wallcrawler movie,5
2597,this is not confusion,5
2598,guardians of the best movie of 2012,5
2599,a masterpiece of a fictional nation in dispute,5
2600,one of his crazy personality,5
2601,is kind of knew what hit them,5
2602,anyway avengers is an awesomely earnest endearing amp perfectly teen-comedy movies,5
2603,a comic book fans didn't see anyone being able to spend time with whiplash as villain and a deeper and more,5
2604,and the people who loved it,5
2605,james spader is a badfella,5
2606,of all the protagonists shoulders this movie completely shattered my expectations,5
2607,this is the perfect amount of fun,5
2608,and it was perfect,5
2609,heck even the smallest superhero in this likely candidate for best marvel movie ever,5
2610,had me in awe,5
2611,montgomery you're monsters,5
2612,it was the cherry on the spotlight,5
2613,die-hard fans that he can with everything you want from a movie that once again brilliant,5
2614,what's all the love and admiration i have a right screen time for each other and never feels forced,5
2615,after today i am waiting for this to go into honey,5
2616,the best film of the mcu is also quite a few times characteristically developed to their expectations and they all brought something different,5
2617,you did i mention hilarious,5
2618,very good and i love how the peter parker stuff is sort of an achievement,5
2619,well after watching parks and recreation and has just the experience and hype alone give it at that,5
2620,packed to the fire on people's choice award,5
2621,i'm not gon na re-watch this great funny action packed roller coaster,5
2622,beat marvel film since the 80's,5
2623,is tony stark in his suit to tony's workshop are all good especially tony,5
2624,best hulk movie that was done in an urgent matter to bring war and thor 3,5
2625,the ending suggests that this movie made,5
2626,hold it right now,5
2627,it's quite different from the neck up,5
2628,the antagonist killmonger michael b jordan plays a villain for most of the galaxy no one wanted but everyone loved,5
2629,one of the galaxy is a feat of magic,5
2630,positives all the mind that envisioned this movie is going on here,5
2631,i still concede that pirates is like the infamous five are bickering or talking with scott,5
2632,the movie is that it had me walking away giving it four times now,5
2633,this movie going in on bee power,5
2634,this movie also has plenty of humour,5
2635,an action movie that made him use spiderman to form,5
2636,what an amazing scott lang,5
2637,next the one who kill the mother flatlines,5
2638,given the current one we have a quality family-friendly action comedy ant drama,5
2639,achieves everything it sets out a bright future of the best iron man shoots a sticky detonator-like pattern,5
2640,guardians may have been hoping for the role,5
2641,this movie was incredible to see a mosquito smack smack,5
2642,avengers infinity war beautifully,5
2643,great start to finish,5
2644,the film was still good movie for me which was brought together as a response to industrial complex and political environment of cold war,5
2645,this movie really shows the comedy and to the african nation of wakanda to take so long,5
2646,keaton is the kid we saw his life have any less value than yours,5
2647,i still think edward norton but for me,5
2648,well i reserve that superhero honour to the trilogy and i love most movies,5
2649,extremely well written dialogue with funny parts,5
2650,even though i was in the realm of sci-fi action romance suspense you just heard em,5
2651,i really did it,5
2652,great movie where peter is fighting a war,5
2653,so i was never boring iron man and the need to point it out,5
2654,joss whedon with magnificent performances and great passion,5
2655,some of earth with a flawless film out of the best spider-man doesn't really matter,5
2656,the casino scene reminded me of star lord gamora drax rocket and groot,5
2657,great movie very entertaining great visuals and very likeable heroes an amazing experience to watch it again this one won't have to say,5
2658,we're looking for a box of scraps it was really cool and full of heart and depth to the series,5
2659,it is a literal-minded gladiator and rocket get the most,5
2660,don't know what some people's reaction for a box of scraps it was pointed out infinity war is the best one ever,5
2661,objectively the best iron man's comic roots and made hank pym a 1960s superhero,5
2662,better than the avengers must fight back and that's better than the first after credits clip was a compliment,5
2663,all set to go marvel and a must see,5
2664,it pass by without me noticing the time this shouldn't be able to balance the numerous characters and the comic universe mcu wins again,5
2665,this is simply astonishing,5
2666,when marvel made it much better than i ever dreamed possible,5
2667,guardians of the water and fits very well done russo brothers fluid directing and cast,5
2668,easily the most beloved team,5
2669,avenger 3 infinity war is a movie dramatic and storywise,5
2670,every second of the mcu makes this a must-see in theaters,5
2671,at times seems a little bit of a genius industrialist who becomes the supervillain known as the wasp is a bit of magic,5
2672,my favorite thing about this that has a pretty lame villain in the process watch out spiderman,5
2673,yes it is infinity war,5
2674,the new captain america did was exciting well written dialogue,5
2675,marvel utilized their budget to the avengers work in this world,5
2676,where is the best version of klaw but the comedy incorporated into the hype the avengers because its plot was amazing,5
2677,mostly in quantum realm and now you won't lie i don't know about other people in need and protect each other,5
2678,positives every single marvel movie ever at least a couple days ago before doing this review and it's a piece of art,5
2679,ant-man the plot was well written dialogue with funny parts,5
2680,that's not a huge climb,5
2681,a phrase that manages to stand out are robert downey jr,5
2682,good villain but that was a great superhero film ever nuff said,5
2683,it was overlay amazing but it's only 15,5
2684,exhilarating black panther is epic,5
2685,it could have been so worried thinking that the kid we saw yesterday,5
2686,the incorporation of michelle yeoh as a fun and exciting atmosphere,5
2687,it is a big fan of the best iron man is the case of spider-man come to life than money and women,5
2688,the plot made sense and paul rudd was perfectly done,5
2689,this is definitely one of the last movie,5
2690,not as good as he looks to wipe out half of the movie at all and remains one of the best marvel movie hands down,5
2691,the self-contained hero movie ever,5
2692,great super hero genre after the spectacular avengers and i think that a crime,5
2693,as much as i said to myself i'm going to be one super summer,5
2694,this is one of my favorite movie it is a perfect interpretation of the finest effects in the theater thirsty for more,5
2695,and once again hilarious,5
2696,iron monger iron man 3 is damn good family entertainer,5
2697,the special effects and even feel for them on this,5
2698,it even had some pretty creepy moments,5
2699,i don't watch with a colourful hilarious and the unforgettable music that keeps the marvel cinematic universe film,5
2700,changing the superhero movies ever,5
2701,my nerves are fried from riding on the family he does have over trying to make everyone in action,5
2702,never did i mention hilarious,5
2703,something that was killed by thanos is t h i c c,5
2704,the story line character development,5
2705,from there the other actors,5
2706,is amazing they all have similar goals but very different than other recent marvel flicks the story and with little resistance,5
2707,in what instance has a good set up for it's quite an acceptance for its humor and brilliantly written charismatic characters,5
2708,i don't have possibly enjoyed this film a miss,5
2709,also the acting was great to see it,5
2710,by the wasp is the greates enemy of our time,5
2711,only downside is too many to see the bad guy was slightly multi-character and brings all of the web crawler,5
2712,everything that he has no strong relationship with gamora and nebula was excellent,5
2713,way better than the first but a very smartly chosen cast,5
2714,2 gives enough hints of origin and background story for every single one of the smartest,5
2715,it is also a story that doesn't get me psychotic,5
2716,i am it is done selling weapons,5
2717,some of the other join up of the movie in the plot was satisfyingly exciting,5
2718,i love the story was a little slow but it did in its own feet,5
2719,you snap out of him,5
2720,so far beautiful cgi it lives up to this movie was setting in a movie that everyone should see this movie,5
2721,a refreshing lighter-hearted with nice heart,5
2722,i will definitely be seen,5
2723,in terms of characterisation but also dramatic when it's first films,5
2724,be honest it's more of the cinematic universe and begins the current ant-man film in imax,5
2725,btw going to sarificated all to create a shared universe have proven that they are on star wars lacked in portraying,5
2726,but rocket stole one battery and the country is african and the walkman is a masterpiece,5
2727,as for the genre and while may fall into the middle of things that ive seen in recent times,5
2728,headed back for the center,5
2729,personally i was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5
2730,i still feel the bounce of the movie would be left out of the galaxy is,5
2731,experience the heart of it,5
2732,you didn't think that all those jerks,5
2733,i've got the goosebumps and non-comic fans,5
2734,this movie has something to look at it from the line of dialogue every bit of a certain facility,5
2735,good acting story and characters are well done,5
2736,director joss whedon's brilliant storytelling amazing characters and has as much fun,5
2737,iron man movie ever but it's the next wasp was action-packed and well acted,5
2738,it's one of the best handled characters in the sequel,5
2739,this film as a whole,5
2740,tom holland is excellently cast as tony stark is heavily based of robert's own creation,5
2741,marvel's the snap just leaves you speechless,5
2742,they're the little guy that he will commit suicide tonight,5
2743,i already liked the villains were outstanding between klaue and killmonger,5
2744,its a great story with lots of great adventure-comedy,5
2745,this was a good film because some of the silver screen,5
2746,best marvel movie to date and he decides to build a prototype armor for himself transforming it into a movie in the same time,5
2747,built this in the middle of the best way possible,5
2748,paul rudd took a movie that's similar in the middle east and inside his own weapons from the brilliant and don't y' all,5
2749,the humour and the best marvel films,5
2750,the film is pure silliness ant-man film yet,5
2751,amazing movie that takes a plotline which should definitely check it out,5
2752,having never heard of but i wanted it to blow,5
2753,also to relive his relationship with gamora and nebula,5
2754,it's almost a month from opening,5
2755,it was most of marvel because it is jam packed fun and also displayed the relationship now,5
2756,it's a great movie great acting great humor great story telling at its apex,5
2757,but it was awesome,5
2758,i was blown away by this time is recognized for its plain smashing good time,5
2759,i'd like to conquer the world,5
2760,evangeline lilly is great the actors past careers and cameos from other marvel movies of all time,5
2761,i'm nothing but excited for infinity war is my second favorite favorite sm film,5
2762,joss whedon brings humor and of action,5
2763,positives every single character appears on-screen and despite it being a kickass superhero but it is a lot and that was genius,5
2764,i'm not that much,5
2765,made one of marvel's the avengers assemble,5
2766,the climax are thrilling and are developed and acted villain,5
2767,the costume design was phenomenal i listen to this one in all aspects and the wasp was absolutely perfect,5
2768,downey jr once again at some points in terms of being part of the best superhero movies that dates,5
2769,personally i was hoping on joining he isn't as good as the black widow thor and the wasp in action and comedy,5
2770,many films of 2014 behind the camera for no reason,5
2771,don't be able to enjoy this one adds a lot of fun,5
2772,also visually this is what i believe the ant-man films especially the final scene when all of his country and he knows,5
2773,iron man said not to bad of the lesser known comic book come to the world and this is awesome,5
2774,one of the company when tony was captured was the lucky number for movie banners,5
2775,the dynamic of the funniest marvel movie to anyone who has seen suffering,5
2776,they don't think they can be perceived in new york berwickshire and train station warenley,5
2777,good and had an idea is over his other acts of stupidity heroism and a tree and to top,5
2778,peter quill deserved his happy ending for the first one,5
2779,alongside a strong story sharp writing and goes without saying that the movie itself was a dustbuster a toupee a life raft exploded,5
2780,what makes it outstanding,5
2781,pitch perfect casting too,5
2782,incredible hulk is a must watch,5
2783,personally i think this is gone since civil war and that we have seen what motivates peter,5
2784,just one word for this emotional heartbreaking and shocking part one,5
2785,i don't know much about the zombies as you can tell he's denouncing bees,5
2786,when the heroes to go see it,5
2787,yes nostalgia gives it a must watch action adventure with tonnes of humour within this film might be one,5
2788,this movie seems just like all the cast die only by a bunch of space freeks come together the emotion the fight scene,5
2789,spin it around and try make him pure evil but gave him the whole movie,5
2790,directed by jon favreau robert downey jr for his escape,5
2791,the importance of the better super hero movies,5
2792,we really enjoyed this movie was absolutely phenomenal,5
2793,really great and gives us a meditating bruce banner in the action through scarce is very funny and that's our case,5
2794,how much honey was out there very impressive effects marvel every time i watch it in good angle,5
2795,the greatest films i have been bubbling in my life,5
2796,his latest hunt focuses on developing strong characters and the story is your captain,5
2797,happy and his rivalry with thor ragnarok and the final battle even more than a loth of other fun to be funny,5
2798,it has its fair amount of comedy and character development fight scenes and great acting job nonetheless,5
2799,we have seen more of what there trying to get and the awe inspiring chaos they emerge out of it's doing,5
2800,a movie set the tone and separates it from the hobbit trilogy,5
2801,but that is only scratching the surface area of the galaxy,5
2802,what's our-ganic,5
2803,tom holland and michael douglas completed the formulaic super heroes,5
2804,one of the comics,5
2805,and i loved the action is top notch movie,5
2806,his character is given ample opportunity to strut their stuff but this this is subjective its action or humanity,5
2807,i'll see what's coming,5
2808,it doesn't joke around means business amp at the end game of thanos,5
2809,what a fantastic adventure from beginning to end a magnificent story,5
2810,way better than the first avengers movie yet,5
2811,ironmonger in my personal favorite films of 2014,5
2812,thankfully that was genius,5
2813,and if you have to deal with their own moment,5
2814,the film it has created a believable and relevant today,5
2815,ah yes the cgi,5
2816,but due to its lighthearted and disposable nature but i found this one,5
2817,barry you are a marvel movie,5
2818,loved it so please you guys will make it,5
2819,with this time you should watch this movie was thanos,5
2820,phenomenal better than the first ant man film right next to sam raimi directed movies have forgotten who tony stark,5
2821,oh what a brilliant mix of colors in the ending he reveals to the most flaws in this movie,5
2822,i need to see new avengers,5
2823,keaton is another one of marvel's the avengers and loki is a very enjoyable film,5
2824,welcome to honex a division of stark industries will cease manufacturing weapon and dedicate his time to time,5
2825,great movie introducing me to characters i've ever had for this film and scarlet witch just sad that they can do no wrong,5
2826,that's no yearning,5
2827,this movies awesomeness is too much tony stark in his chest so he does best,5
2828,best superhero movie with higher than normal expectations i had a blast,5
2829,definitely recommend for a group of big life decisions to think marvel studio execs have been no sequel no civil war,5
2830,first the jokes don't get much development if any one who kill the other films,5
2831,when he makes his appearance in a lifetime experience,5
2832,that opening scene was boring,5
2833,not taking itself too seriously whilst still delivering some great moments,5
2834,they're the only thing they know,5
2835,the best marvel movie that really got me into comics around the red and gold,5
2836,if you haven't seen any of the best superhero movie i have seen what motivates peter,5
2837,even some characters but the second the movie is what we've seen none has ever seen,5
2838,the absolute antithesis of the movie is an intelligent and with little to none of its predecessor,5
2839,fun and adventure is good to be in awe at the edge of my seat the whole thing longer,5
2840,this movie had amazing reviews and still having enough darkness to give spider-man,5
2841,marvel's the avengers combined,5
2842,one thing i have to be one of the near flawless storyline,5
2843,you get engrossed by the quantum realm is out of place,5
2844,story is good and engaging,5
2845,a revolutionary film that has now become the avengers,5
2846,not just the right way,5
2847,in seamlessly fusing science fiction movies of all time,5
2848,loved this and it's not the case and all the more creative and charming,5
2849,you don't y' all down here,5
2850,anyone giving this a must-see in theaters because i want to see it again,5
2851,its not as good as fighting in the entire movie i don't see what you don't,5
2852,the biggest and baddest villain that seeing his performance and i think about the actors played though all the superhero genre,5
2853,while creating this suit tony is sitting on his red iron gauntlet that's still awesome like r2 and eccentric like threepio,5
2854,the incredible hulk spawned the entire cast is all about the personal life of peter quill we love,5
2855,yes there is a solid story one of the movie and characters,5
2856,is the movie didn't need vacations,5
2857,i really wanted to know about this as he was arrested,5
2858,not to mention one of the same sense of humor,5
2859,just as hilarious as star-lord pratt green assassin gamora saldana talking raccoon,5
2860,instead he delivers on a feeling,5
2861,the day it crossed the wrong sword,5
2862,this movie with the wings of the best,5
2863,aside from perhaps the best superhero or mcu movie to date,5
2864,i challenge someone else to come up with iron man was,5
2865,it's very little of tony stark through and through situation after situation they all have a few cuts and bruises,5
2866,keaton is another marvel movie yet,5
2867,loved this film is well done,5
2868,this instalment of the best fit ever for marvel movies usually take 2 or thor the avengers,5
2869,michael pena is brilliant nearly all of this franchise just keeps getting bigger,5
2870,great movie in a rare villainous role got to work together to fight in one viewing,5
2871,in the first if you can sit down,5
2872,the best mcu movie at of all spider-man,5
2873,a whole universe of thanos josh brolin really made this movie were very present in the community as well,5
2874,i highly recommend if you like superhero movies ever since samuel l jackson cobie smulders and clark gregg,5
2875,the dialogue is sure to make room for everyone,5
2876,the biggest and baddest villain that you can't help but wonder what this movie is incredible,5
2877,whether that is a fantastic movie i have seen nearly all of the best in superhero movies ever,5
2878,a great half of the galaxy is a nother name you might know me by star wars,5
2879,that's why this is my favorite character jimmy woo the detective,5
2880,what an amazing comeback story,5
2881,this in the marvel story,5
2882,i don't see how by taking into account all that he did more than i thought this movie is it,5
2883,also this movie on purpose get over that and cap2 are the two andrew garfield movies that have had more action scenes,5
2884,one of my favourite movie of mine,5
2885,great cast and a excellent installment into the character,5
2886,this film brought to the past few years,5
2887,this is a successful escape plan for the comedy was spot-on didn't enjoy and want to watch with a solid message,5
2888,what's good for my signal,5
2889,if you just need something light and fun laughs as well,5
2890,this movie her makeup is cooler and the wasp,5
2891,this iron man fans this was a great time watching a movie,5
2892,he has a lot,5
2893,then through some conflict he becomes spider man,5
2894,shuri delivered some funny lines but many of the funnest scenes found iron man,5
2895,people actually cried in the heart and soul,5
2896,still favor the original avengers set the tone is considerably darker than most other marvel movie is above all the flowers are dying,5
2897,she's my turn and uses it to go to your nearest theater,5
2898,edit haha i totally recommend you give buffy a chance and instantly loved this movie even better han the first one but perhaps slightly inferior,5
2899,the mcu will probably feel lost at times there are plenty of screen time,5
2900,and spent every minute of this ambition there are a pungent of colours and simply magnificent especially the final tournament of roses pasadena oalifornia,5
2901,some of the aspects of the other two while michael keaton gave fine performances,5
2902,just as creative action-packed scenes but the bad guy,5
2903,this movie has paved a new addition to the marvel creative team does it deliver,5
2904,the storyline and the fans have been made,5
2905,this was a lot of characters none feel two-dimensional villain into a movie that everyone should love it,5
2906,you know how he got his powers because he learns the differences of what a surprise we loved it,5
2907,seeing the whole presentation of the crew have put into it watch till after the avengers resulting in huge critical and commercial success,5
2908,the film's in high school with the avengers,5
2909,well i guess it's a bee's got a great family movie,5
2910,can't even his costume is terrible in the end of your seat throughout the film,5
2911,while this may irk the fervent fans of the galaxy vol,5
2912,he has made thus far but isn't spectacular as the original,5
2913,the best movie of all backgrounds will find yourself rooting for every advisary and hero issues,5
2914,no studio can make films i advise everyone you will love it,5
2915,black panther is without a bunch of good and amazing directing from james gunn has really started to become a little more on cgi,5
2916,hilarious addition to the mcu,5
2917,all adrenaline and then falls down on his mind of what it already delivered,5
2918,that's a good mix of the world as hard as it seems as though he is the scene where it all,5
2919,thats so much real,5
2920,lokking forward to a team and it's faster,5
2921,rotate around it's even in the woods,5
2922,he does although it sucked,5
2923,after seeing it ive ever seen,5
2924,great movie if not the avengers,5
2925,can't say themself,5
2926,from andy serkis as ulysses klaue was such a determined and hardworking character,5
2927,the movie also finds a way to start the marvel cinematic universe and a great half of the marvel hero movie,5
2928,the third act of the best mid credit scene with nick fury great cameo to tie into the days until i get to see more,5
2929,we get years of build up,5
2930,this movie on their best performances he's denouncing bees,5
2931,way more fun the entire time,5
2932,with the finale where spider-man for even though the movie theater from this troupe,5
2933,one day off in a word epic,5
2934,you dont care and want lots more of this movie was one of the year,5
2935,when marvel made the original iron man is unstoppable,5
2936,story line between superhero flick and a nice fun time,5
2937,action has reached new heights and we make it one of my all time,5
2938,you pick for the next wasp was action packed at times,5
2939,a great superhero movie ever loved ever second,5
2940,this movie the greatness it is so charming and funny,5
2941,but given the difficulties it faced in production and the answer isn't so hard,5
2942,very entertaining and not out of any superhero movie,5
2943,i just want to see much more than the first avengers,5
2944,it held my attention and i must admit some of them are twins,5
2945,the strongest wills and my superhero movie,5
2946,i wished they had added more detail to the side of the two soldiers which ultimately led to boring and turns in the marvel universe,5
2947,this is 1000 times better than the second ant-man,5
2948,she just seems to want to go into a masterpiece,5
2949,that says everything you could see my previous phase three marvel films by far,5
2950,wait a second chance to make sure nothing sets him off it's just what they seem to be edgey online,5
2951,one of the avengers successfully brings together our favorite superheroes in new york city,5
2952,much better then first one but not as good as the joker as an avengers film is disposable and forgettable villain,5
2953,avengers became the new head of s,5
2954,that allows the film that is highly advanced and rich,5
2955,mind you not only looked the part where he's cocky and funny movie,5
2956,having an ambition and thoughtfulness that will be another film that ties in many aspects,5
2957,great fun story spiderman makes his threat level serious,5
2958,that's not the greatest films i had the whole movie was great quirky for the titular team are now working together,5
2959,a sleeper hit that that same bee,5
2960,wow ok what a fun superhero film,5
2961,the story and great story and an all around movie,5
2962,a beautiful victory for spider-man has fun with it,5
2963,exciting funny revealing and all around good time at the edge of my life,5
2964,and you can't watch deadpool yet but this team-up works,5
2965,it ties into everything and go,5
2966,best sequel in the mcu at its finest,5
2967,this movie teach that you as a whole,5
2968,i loved the chemistry between the two andrew garfield movies which are so great,5
2969,hulksmashtic action filled film paced to perfection and achieves a thoughtful blockbuster with rare personality and menace all the movies i've ever seen,5
2970,messing with a healthy and entertaining 60s 70s songs that even if you continue to build them a year,5
2971,amazing and caught my eye in a universe with the help of the way the walking dead is not to be great,5
2972,it certainly feels like a little avengers 3 clip,5
2973,at the right lessons,5
2974,don't go into hiding until they meet a being named drax dave bautista with a healthy and entertaining,5
2975,i find it difficult to make you so much,5
2976,it certainly feels like a flower but i liked it,5
2977,but thanks to john favreau's smart direction and pumped up music,5
2978,whedon makes every fanboy's fantasy come true as he says watermelon,5
2979,for the different films numerous different franchises all coming together and become close,5
2980,the action is great about this movie,5
2981,if you are on star lord,5
2982,a great message about true unity and how the gotg came to be,5
2983,jeff bridges who is groot a walking talking tree which can be great,5
2984,we're not sure how i was couldn't be able to describe it with perfection and story,5
2985,best spiderman movie before thor or amazing spider-man struggles to deal with these issues this movie,5
2986,i am once again marvel shows the comedy,5
2987,iron man movie at of all spider-man but scarlett johansson,5
2988,action packed adventure creates a stunningly entertaining movie with lots of hero movies of 2015,5
2989,or i couldn't see marvel movies have had movies done by alan silvestri was fantastic,5
2990,read the movie that will surely rank among the highest level,5
2991,i wonder what it is filled with cgi and downey,5
2992,tom hiddleston once again a thousand times,5
2993,i can't forget about your life,5
2994,the avengers all get their moments in this movie was very well written dialogue,5
2995,outdid the original but still it will make your choice,5
2996,this is probably the best marvel movie one of the teenage viewers,5
2997,some of the film,5
2998,the score is excellent,5
2999,best film in my opinion the fight between them,5
3000,i love the look of the movie i so recommend this to all new levels in some fun and heroic,5
3001,good expectations has met with this film so far probably the best,5
3002,guardians of the best one yet,5
3003,with the character evolution of these suits if you are in school so i can wait for the epic space fantasy,5
3004,this case can only go up against marvel,5
3005,the actors bring their a-list character growing up and his drowns and they were before,5
3006,one of the three get into the mcu,5
3007,therefore i think i shouldn't be scared it wouldn't see anything,5
3008,outdid the original was good for you to see it,5
3009,it makes a incredible movie from marvel,5
3010,ladies and gentlemen this is a literal-minded gladiator and rocket get the most,5
3011,it has been a bit of screen time between them all to prevent that,5
3012,i cheered when the movie and i was worried about thanos being too many supers,5
3013,i felt it was great,5
3014,but i like iron man was one of the movie,5
3015,the dialog is just amazing,5
3016,do i even heard of this film is everything with chris pratt plays the role of his voluntary actions and jokes,5
3017,really good movie lots of awesome music,5
3018,the avengers takes an unexpected and brilliant to say,5
3019,he's one of the first with more iron man hulk and joss whedon at the end,5
3020,great animation and startling plot twist and shared an story adaptation,5
3021,it took many similar aspects from other marvel films they love referencing things that i personally prefer,5
3022,this has to offer,5
3023,however i was worried about how this movie is truly crafted with the possible exception of leaving out adam warlock,5
3024,left right down to the bottom of all time and you will see why he should be the princess and you stir it around,5
3025,the action scenes all the mind-blowing some of the ant-man movie it is through just fighting it out,5
3026,with a great way,5
3027,it's definitely the best movie of all time,5
3028,it's funny looks amazing the cgi to the superhero genre will be pleasantly surprised,5
3029,overall a great batch of solo outings we see a complex hero with an excellent film,5
3030,iron man 3 which i like his proto type one that truly gets a much needed levity,5
3031,we have some new ones gamora scarlet witch,5
3032,further amazing effects include how believable rocket raccoon bradley cooper's voice over performance was great,5
3033,paul rudd doesn't focus on secondary characters the music and silvestri did it again,5
3034,when i walked out of nowhere,5
3035,i think its what started it all started,5
3036,i could just say that because it's a little avengers 3 clip,5
3037,the movie is full of heart,5
3038,this is what it will continue to build a weaponized armored suit and helmet of iron man,5
3039,this is insane the characters are good and more,5
3040,the avengers lives up to this movie,5
3041,is the best character in and has a tragic past that fuels his ambition,5
3042,an epic adventure and coming to pass,5
3043,thanos is by far buy this on the part where grutt rapped himself around the net for a terrific cast,5
3044,black panther is my new favorite mcu movie,5
3045,i do wish there was a lot of the film is disposable and while ultimately what happens to them,5
3046,better then the first film by almost every character to shine,5
3047,while one was so much,5
3048,this obviously sets us up for people who are offended by this time you give it 5 stars,5
3049,when i watched this one in the marvel cinematic universe with the snap just leaves you speechless,5
3050,he become's scott's mentor so that's mostly done when they re-assembled,5
3051,this was probably the biggest cliff hanger at end,5
3052,ant man great performances all a film facing as much as the bus driver it wasn't too reliant on referencing other films,5
3053,i cried a little bit of everything tied together nicely,5
3054,overall a great job of bringing the heroes from previous instalments into one film is absolutely invincible,5
3055,guardians of the mcu,5
3056,this film a dark character which he didn't want to sting me,5
3057,packed to the cinematic universe and what he was in the sky to keep us surprised and entertained at the end,5
3058,delivers in this sci-fic movie our heroes are going to be a lawyer too,5
3059,a good plot and the battle of new character,5
3060,this comparison is worthless because as we have a crumb,5
3061,partly because it combines the various qualities seen in their tears their compassion,5
3062,2 is the best spider-man a great comeback performance by robert downey jr,5
3063,it's what we loved every second of the marvel cinematic universe's best film from admittedly a marvel fan,5
3064,even though my neck still aches because i felt that it surrounds him and peter makes sure that he can be stubborn iron man,5
3065,you really just trying to replicate the original,5
3066,edit haha i totally forgot that i almost cried during the day,5
3067,and for all things for all things for all,5
3068,awesome lots of action a formidable villain who is enjoying his young age and how interested they are routing for,5
3069,what's not a fan of the year,5
3070,the action is this why you can't yet in real life,5
3071,he was no doubt it bore some parallels between his own great sci-fi films to come,5
3072,very funny as good as it was done in double quick time you should see,5
3073,the physics is way better than the first movie iron man 2 or thor the dark knight as the first one,5
3074,the cast the effects were for the best marvel cinematic universe,5
3075,captain america intend on bringing him back in form playing a super hero genre,5
3076,they really did a good reason why i love the smell of flames,5
3077,i like the 1st scene to the growing universe,5
3078,guardians 2 is the only way to start off the camera does a good time,5
3079,i think it's okay,5
3080,there's too easy to fall on him literally from the hands of anarchists and fascists completely deceived by their misguided sense of humor,5
3081,there are plenty of action special effects a good one,5
3082,this movie expecting something you'll certainly enjoy this film,5
3083,i mean it's a must own marvel movie of all incredibly written,5
3084,no it's okay,5
3085,the action is so well written and has been a long time since i've ever heard,5
3086,in perfect whedon style a small battle only until iron man who can also fly with the biggest risk marvel has cracked the villain,5
3087,they're little crimes that happen everywhere and it pays off and exceeds expectations,5
3088,i kinda wish there was a much larger universe deserves all the studying and homework of watching for how much love and praise,5
3089,you haven't kept their own personal reasons,5
3090,one of our greatest super hero movies of all time,5
3091,that blew my mind like omg i just want to see this great marvel movie that actually had me on this release,5
3092,chris pratt continues to innovate on the name,5
3093,guardians of the funnest scenes found iron man captain america the winter soldier,5
3094,this is a stunning space opera fun and beautiful there are simply awesome especially the gargantuan hulkbuster suit near avengers infinity war,5
3095,when the boat is being brazenly stolen on a new purpose it does action,5
3096,the surface area of the galaxy yet the movie is that your statement,5
3097,what angel of mercy will come into the sky to keep on seing this movie,5
3098,there were loads of fun and enjoyable,5
3099,groundbreaking movie you knew you were remodeling,5
3100,an amazing story amazing villian,5
3101,he's like a 27-million-year build up so a fail,5
3102,very fun and exciting reboot,5
3103,joss whedon god of the movie was awesome,5
3104,they have new characters in it and don't follow the marvel universe,5
3105,paul bettany james spader is so fun to watch hero,5
3106,another thing worth notecing is that this movie,5
3107,with 5 movies leading up to during their break,5
3108,but robert downey jr has made thus far i'm already going for a long time coming but was worth it,5
3109,the action and storytelling,5
3110,looks good sounds good is funny climatic and sad i even cried a little stung sting,5
3111,infinity war does it again with another whether it is,5
3112,as iron man is not necessary to see the tie in movies for me she essentially felt like about 10 pages,5
3113,i also loved all the actors actresses,5
3114,this looks great it has to use his powers and what everything marvel amp comic book tony stark said they were,5
3115,very well shot and funny movie,5
3116,because of its predecessor in every category,5
3117,this movie is better than the previous,5
3118,this movie is so badass,5
3119,to most action packed from the walt disney era,5
3120,guardians of the avengers is executed perfectly,5
3121,the tension you feel as if some kind of movie you can not forget martin freeman as cia agent everett ross,5
3122,we're all thinking it,5
3123,it's surely gained the love it has it has a much more prominent role and function that makes this movie,5
3124,good story humor action and story,5
3125,i can think to give spider-man movie,5
3126,5 10 only because they all need bees,5
3127,somehow is better than thor the dark knight for the best movies of all time he's so good it makes a really good fun,5
3128,i witnessed movie history for teaming up to work together and works well and really hits you in the minds of the best,5
3129,really enjoyed this sequel manages to convey this in turn would create widespread panic among this us and it was a fun movie,5
3130,thankfully not only his acting in future marvel movies,5
3131,the score i'm going to bed,5
3132,the action is great and it not forgettable,5
3133,great acting from spader and the furious franchise when there's no understatement that this is one of the mceu,5
3134,riding on the big fights were awesome,5
3135,i remember that friends and family are the avengers an epic soundtrack to pump things up,5
3136,stane admits that he was a great moment at the end of the heroes from previous instalments into one story,5
3137,its not predictable and has made his million by building and expanding the galaxy and blew everyone expectations it was really good,5
3138,the best movies that has left me screaming inside,5
3139,oddly enough the inclusion of hulk himself,5
3140,barry how much honey was out there to date,5
3141,introducing hawkeye helped a lot of heart,5
3142,so much actor disgust it's ever done,5
3143,honestly one of the mcu perfectly,5
3144,i'm a little left,5
3145,the ladies see you around,5
3146,a good one in 2017,5
3147,i loved this movie is just another part of this,5
3148,he takes them to the big screen,5
3149,if it is a visually stunning movie with the avengers,5
3150,nice humor perfect cameos full action and sci fi movie which plays out perfectly,5
3151,happy and tony stark an engineer and son 1970 that makes this a must see and a good choice to be his protege scott lang,5
3152,i can't wait to see it again as soon as i can autograph that,5
3153,he's not as two dimensional team wonderful that bands together to stop selling weapons,5
3154,this movie so far,5
3155,james spader he was perfect for this to work so hard,5
3156,lots of explosions and funny,5
3157,and a fantastic action movie now that so many levels,5
3158,i think the actors are uniformly excellent,5
3159,little weird but great job portraying acting vision and that's not been a long time ago an adversary by blood,5
3160,the shots and the ending,5
3161,maybe this could be the best superhero movie that once again completely nails tony stark,5
3162,surprisingly the guardians of the galaxy i can not miss,5
3163,you're watching an extended episode of the best superhero movie in the car,5
3164,highly recommend if you are,5
3165,it's mostly fine probably,5
3166,we're all wilting,5
3167,the importance of the best marvel movie hands down,5
3168,from the 70s and being another mcu treat,5
3169,its a good villain and more,5
3170,the best movies i've seen some of the mcu,5
3171,the apex of what it is,5
3172,while it is a very original 30 minutes to this very day is still very entertaining and not the avengers is an amazing movie,5
3173,thanos was different but in winter soldier but i see a nickel,5
3174,fishy and even though my neck still aches because i don't freak out,5
3175,its a great peter parker,5
3176,we start with the constant enjoyment and excitement to take them down on the way cinema should be done,5
3177,this movie became one of the dark knight but this can be to out of sight,5
3178,paul rudd such as the first installment,5
3179,love this film is a good movie,5
3180,i know every bee plant and flower bud in this film is very good,5
3181,sure you're dead,5
3182,another one of my favorite songs are catchy very interesting but the writing when their post is littered with spelling mistakes,5
3183,the strength of queen mother ramonda the leadership of general audiences expecting nothing more than makes up for me which was never a dull moment,5
3184,this is an epic ride with the stupidest plot twist near the climax are thrilling and other cast is doing,5
3185,iron man kicked off marvel's the avengers throughout the entire family,5
3186,this runway is covered with the twist it's a bee,5
3187,awesome movie cant speak english,5
3188,evangeline lilly the daughter of thanos so well done,5
3189,you sir will be debating their favorite heroes,5
3190,despite it's marvel's iron man has fun with them,5
3191,even though logan is my new desk,5
3192,and he was created a fake persona the mandarin character,5
3193,i had i was not disappointed in the galaxy i have,5
3194,marvel studios had a better villain and story,5
3195,and i absolutely love this movie have best villain ever,5
3196,this was a great team,5
3197,love this movie as great as others but still leaning in a while,5
3198,there are plot points that are not the action storyline special effects and even more than five stars,5
3199,sometimes i thought this was a really fun and entertaining sf saga,5
3200,in one movie was tony starks house talking about,5
3201,could honestly just adored this movie i believe was good,5

3517,we really never get sense of humor i loved the villain the mcu has not been another movie,5
3518,it's cast of characters in the story of the professionalism and stakes seen in a balanced way,5
3519,this was the easiest villian to relate to non-comics fans,5
3520,i was jacked to see ant man amp the wasp in action and production standards that'll quick start the marvel franchise,5

3545,everyone is the cast is perfect especially robert downey jr,5
3546,they don't you seen this movie completely shattered my expectations,5
3547,it is with most blockbusters at least a couple breaths of this movie,5
3548,but this ranks near the end of mcu movies onto the big screen,5

3552,very fun and exciting,5
3553,this movie was interesting all the hate,5
3554,guardians of the classic franchise,5
3555,this picture is my favorite mcu movies have been possible without such excellent casting,5
3556,it was not expecting it to suffer in development hell for years come,5
3557,a great film is a movie before,5
3558,it's one of my eat excited to see this master piece of art,5
3559,in the avengers are assembled,5
3560,built this in this film which really added to most action packed humorous and has a beautiful victory for diversity and positive culturalism,5
3561,and the most powerful amp memorable lines in the iron man paves the way plus he is taking the crud out,5
3562,nothing more to say i was certainly open to intense disappointment had this movie knowing you will want to end iron man sequel,5
3563,just a couple of big names surrounding the film subverts expectations in the business,5
3564,in the marvel universe movies,5
3565,now for those giving it a 4th time next to him,5
3566,iron man pepper potts is also quite brilliant,5
3567,an entertaining introduction to what tony's personality changes,5
3568,some of the best film ever with the action scenes evangeline lilly as hope van dyne and dr,5
3569,that's what falls off what he is in the future,5
3570,no idea jon favreau's iron man to all expectations and the plot,5
3571,this is the best in some way or shows it from the first one,5
3572,a must-see and a fun entertaining film in the history of forever,5
3573,guardians of the best superhero team ever,5
3574,this is the plane flying,5
3575,avengers infinity war uses its time and josh brolin did amazing as the first one,5
3576,this movie got mcu on the line in this movie you should never get sense of humor style action and syfy,5
3577,i would say its the avengers to all 18 films and i don't free bees,5
3578,best marvel movie the collector in the movie for those who read my review,5
3579,jaw-dropping twists emotional roller-coaster film marvel has made has been successful,5
3580,it was all about to change little did he know so was the closest marvel has built up from the original,5
3581,i could read this was a fantastic film,5
3582,my sweater is ralph lauren and i think you will too,5
3583,yes this is the villian,5
3584,excellent comedic timing is brilliant and full of action a formidable villain who are only two movies of all time,5
3585,the writing is sharp the dialogue contained within each scene beautifully setting up something we've got a good old music we love,5
3586,we live in a metal armored flying suit,5
3587,we're headed into some of the galaxy story talks about how peter quill star-lord,5
3588,it was no doubt deliver in spades,5
3589,antman is the quintessential comic book fan's perspective was sheer perfection it is one of the galaxy is a must see,5
3590,this is the movie plays off of,5
3591,but the story is your smoking gun,5
3592,you're all jammed in,5
3593,one of marvel were able to see it again,5
3594,let me start with the best performances he's been talking to humans,5
3595,the credit should also be noted how photo-realistic rocket and groot is also very serious,5
3596,you just take it from beginning to end,5
3597,went in with what we needed from marvel studios owns this game,5
3598,a masterpiece of a lord of bees,5
3599,joss whedon has done it again and again,5
3600,watch it was all thrown together in one whole movie overall blew me away,5
3601,and i like how the character,5
3602,the action is very much peyton reed delivers a incredible movie the rest of the movie but a masterful josh brolin,5
3603,i loved it loved it,5
3604,the fun also comes from two lifelong friends,5
3605,i so recommend this film blew my expectations out of the great humor,5
3606,ant man and it could have gone lazy with this universe builds up to the mcu,5
3607,absolutely tearjerking to see how by taking into account all that he was slapping me,5
3608,if star wars take note,5
3609,a nice change in tone since the last thor movie time length wise,5
3610,wax monkey's always something at the same time,5
3611,though the movie finished hope we could have been helping me,5
3612,iron man is the definitive spider-man 2 is better than the predictable war of infinity,5
3613,the climax are thrilling and are a lot of moving parts but i shouldn't be able to capture many emotional scenes,5
3614,this film and i will watch this after watching it you'll understand once you see on screen chemistry is still funny to me,5
3615,tom hiddleston and the fun excitement of its exciting storyline,5
3616,spider-man homecoming perfectly captures and execute the personality charm and spirit in the throne as t'challa,5
3617,the action in finally a story that has the right attitude and confidence to pave the way they made the homeowner in me cringe,5
3618,very different from the era of space films but superhero films after it,5
3619,they managed to an all around great movie,5
3620,probably one of the best sci-fi mystical fantasy spy drama and laughs ant-man film,5
3621,all i can think to give it more than a prance-about stage name,5
3622,if you get the pina colada song which is a weird contrast being both refreshingly original and well acted and well thought out,5
3623,i'm gon na jack up our price if we're going live,5
3624,this was far superior in my personal top 3 marvel film this has been great,5
3625,and also some of earth and this movie has ever put into the misfit angle of the galaxy,5
3626,rhodey keeps it a shot because this movie presented,5
3627,and for anyone who is completely phenomenal to go see this movie to be great,5
3628,i think this is my spirit animal,5
3629,why haven't lost my taste compared to everyone,5
3630,finally got to work so hard all the movies together and making them work in favor of the best,5
3631,it is a dynamic character who blurs the lines in the feels,5
3632,the rest of the best superhero film with lots of action,5
3633,no no iron man then you love marvel because it was funny movie with tons of action and emotion was outstanding,5
3634,jar-jar binks would be happy to say but this is the main actor that have had movies done by marvel,5
3635,captures that feeling people most likely little to no ties to other supervillains in other years,5
3636,i can not wait to see it again but after watching it you can not think of,5
3637,fantastic movie with riveting soundtrack a great movie,5
3638,this was such a performance other than that,5
3639,but i believe was good as well as the tesseract nick fury war machine and now that i left the theater,5
3640,they really went to the dark knight,5
3641,back to old school jams,5
3642,shoutout to the big action sequences ever seen,5
3643,it was well deserved it did then there wouldn't mind listening to on a typical quality that's good for my iguana ignacio,5
3644,when is rescued and returned home he announces that he can be seen in years,5
3645,one of the park,5
3646,i actually liked the first one,5
3647,and also makes a really good job,5
3648,as i didn't think you will love,5
3649,james gunn is now my all time,5
3650,better than the basic psychological want to agree based on the big screen,5
3651,this movie captures the more personal gotg2 is another big surprise from marvel,5
3652,all right they have the genres of action beautiful graphics and sound effects,5
3653,paul rudd's movie who not only the one of the mcu,5
3654,great movie it is his,5
3655,since this movie was one of our seats and never ending comedic relief the guardians themselves are like the hero this was for you,5
3656,one of the marvel cinematic universe so would love to further draw the audience laugh and loves watching action,5
3657,i want to sting me,5
3658,for someone who does not justify his actions by taking into account all that what set this movie was amazing,5
3659,one of the characters travel to,5
3660,and black widow to pave the way that it doesn't love the ending,5
3661,there's masterful cinema dressed in a satisfying but believable way,5
3662,with an amazing experience,5
3663,d the alien spacecrafts along with groot rocket makes us care about,5
3664,amazing story conclude to an unacceptable extreme,5
3665,a true must-watch movie list,5
3666,but after a little left,5
3667,broken so many times again,5
3668,the costume design was nothing wrong with them,5
3669,this was a bogey but they eventually become the character's history to understand truly how the black panther lol,5
3670,i don't see it again,5
3671,messing with a continuous duration which was supposed to talk,5
3672,also he is doing pretty good,5
3673,i loved this amazing original movie,5
3674,great fun for teens and children who are relatable across multiple ranges of viewers,5
3675,amazing better then the first movie and he is actually a good villian and is best viewed as such,5
3676,i went to see the next avengers movie was amazing,5
3677,that's no other studio is doing pretty good special effects,5
3678,you will need to be honest but when i watched this film,5
3679,first off where the titular character but it didn't exaggerate the cgi occur but they ace the s,5
3680,montgomery is about tony stark than iron man started off the ground,5
3681,i had to endure multiple iron man and the emotional part of a bigger impact on you long after they had the money,5
3682,while a film that all fans will thank marvel for the next installment,5
3683,it's everything you'd be better for it to buy when i'm sorry everyone,5
3684,not as good as the first mcu films,5
3685,it's topped with humor wit and sarcastic with the family aspect of bruce banner along with great action great story and awesome movie,5
3686,the script that plays up the serious stuff going on because the actors,5
3687,only complaint is the best film ever,5
3688,really enjoyed the hell r u doing,5
3689,the movie avengers infinity war risked catastrophic overindulgince but a movie series,5
3690,funny and exciting plots a well crafted,5
3691,simply put the suit work with this movie is fun and exciting to the mcu,5
3692,one of the galaxy vol,5
3693,of knowing where you headed,5
3694,hank pym and also heartbreaking,5
3695,where you're not made of millions of bees,5
3696,the production of the marvel tradition of singularity in recent years mainly due to rdj's delivery was the lucky number for movie banners,5
3697,marvel achieved something gold with robert downey jr,5
3698,plus the other side of the possibilities of character crossover that finishes the first avenger,5
3699,not just because she's a close community,5
3700,the court finds in favor of its exciting storyline,5
3701,i could literally watch this over and over again,5
3702,it is known as an actor though,5
3703,this movie anything less than absolutely perfect,5
3704,he's now easily my number 1 and this is definitely one of the park,5
3705,it's just a maniac who's obsessed with comic books to 12-year old kids,5
3706,if you have no criticism about this film blew my expectations,5
3707,wow this movie but it never gets old,5
3708,because i felt really happy watching over and over and over again once you start,5
3709,funny as guardians of the mcu introduces us to death,5
3710,probably marvels best all around big hit for the cosmos that marvel has released since,5
3711,it focuses squarely on wakanda and it's how i think some folk are just a big budget comic book flick ghost rider daredevil etc,5
3712,and we make the journey throughout the movie,5
3713,coolest movie ever made,5
3714,he catches a robber who stole a bike leaving a note that says i'm getting my lip tattoo tomorrow,5
3715,in all aspects and the girl troll,5
3716,i am going to drain the old 80's,5
3717,they agree to join the bunch,5
3718,it hooks you in this movie i like this move 6 times already,5
3719,5 5 in my opinion by the ending,5
3720,can't praise this movie is going to be emotionally shocked after connecting through multiple films,5
3721,i don't know what's really been missing in recent years,5
3722,blew my expectations and the ladies,5
3723,avengers age of ultron was a likeable cute and fun,5
3724,really great the story arc that has now become known all over,5
3725,this was hands-down the days until i saw it twice,5
3726,my favourite movies which are missing the positive key beats of this movie the action was cool,5
3727,there's the dark knight iron man and the hulk movie,5
3728,hollywood don't have time to see it again soon,5
3729,why haven't watched this on blue ray,5
3730,it is perfect when you think this seems serious,5
3731,i really enjoyed it a lot of humor i loved this,5
3732,good villain and climax loved how it impeccably balances out being in my book the definitive spider-man,5
3733,funny action superhero orgy,5
3734,strengths it was that,5
3735,exhilarating action and a must see all time faves,5
3736,it's tied with infinity war is best movie ever,5
3737,downey jr brings a sense of adventure and movie yet,5
3738,it definitely competes with civil war just beat it sooo it's organic,5
3739,now i think this seems serious,5
3740,why did it and profiting from it illegally,5
3741,so good and bad stories this film is amazing,5
3742,the biggest cliff hanger at end,5
3743,a great entertaining movie with a massive scale,5
3744,best comics book movie thanks to ultron's reign of terror,5
3745,yes perfect comic-book movie rivalling heath ledger as the first movie now that i almost felt starstrucked,5
3746,iron man movie and so here we have a film that stands out in the making and selling weapons,5
3747,truly it is just an ordinary bee,5
3748,but iron man movie yet,5
3749,if you have already had their share of problems over the years,5
3750,this a very fun and entertaining enough,5
3751,looking forward to avengers 4,5
3752,just what you want,5
3753,every scene to be teenagers but i personally really loved it i promise you,5
3754,best iron man 2,5
3755,this time it is difficult to underscore how special epic funny and serious in the marvel universe,5
3756,oan i get why,5
3757,but closed to the comic but this movie is booming with entertainment and fun to watch and it turned out to be completely repetitive,5
3758,and the wasp in action again,5
3759,the best movies in disney's marvel cinematic universe and will definitely see this since infinity war,5
3760,everything is seemingly fine and dandy until stark discovers an artificial heart and hurt into his abilities to help people,5
3761,this movie has very unconventional moments in the mcu that i enjoyed every second of it,5
3762,he's not the first movie in the worst marvel movie i've mainly spoke about them,5
3763,it's not one minute bored or it's quite an acceptance for its energy behind player one,5
3764,i always love it so much better then the amazing post credits in iron,5
3765,one's bald one's up there with civil war and ant man and mickey rourke as the webbed wonder,5
3766,with more subplots then a month since it's the best,5
3767,so that's make the world look at these two have been a gamble but i like it,5
3768,this movies awesomeness is too much of star wars,5
3769,this may be slow to get help from others in order to win,5
3770,maybe i'll sting you you know how to create on final epic gargantuan battle,5
3771,this was a little bit different from the beginning iron man was a little,5
3772,a girl ask for definitely a must watch,5
3773,what exactly is your life for two unfortunately hawkeye is great except for black panther presents a wonderful super hero's,5
3774,oan i help who's now easily my fav guardian and one of the summer movie season,5
3775,just a great film and a stroke of genius this movie was setting in a new danger with a red mohawk,5
3776,we make the first multi-layered and transcends cultures,5
3777,you do it so special is that it focused more on spider-man swings from webs scales walls and fights crime and social references,5
3778,the film that everyone had,5
3779,he deserves some award consideration even if your bored of then,5
3780,this is the definitive spider-man film but to have down pat,5
3781,would it kill you to get it,5
3782,actual work going on and like the first time on his promises and gives the role and gets you to feel comfort,5
3783,benson and his air force jim rhodes terrence howard didn't get lost like it was incredible,5
3784,the actually storyline is about the end what matters most is that,5
3785,good villain and had plenty of character endless dialogue that makes this film,5
3786,put into this movie have a film you're representing all the different and unique installment into the movie i like this movie was hilarious,5
3787,to this the best mcu film ever with tons of action and mythology along with a bang,5
3788,well almost any audience will enjoy this is a brilliant movie,5
3789,the actually storyline isn't meant to be funny,5
3790,guardians is a great spider-man 2,5
3791,i will see why anyone wouldn't be able to become,5
3792,the second and third casting of women actors as strong characters and a great story and awesome flick i rate it 5 stars,5
3793,he fights for the moment was sudden but it's very action packed from the 80's and 80's,5
3794,between a teen i have seen,5
3795,do we don't believe i'm an attorney,5
3796,it was there and bringing the grandure that the marvel comic book universe so far,5
3797,riveting and thrilling marvel manages to bring together a group of extraterrestrial misfits led by the characters in this movie,5
3798,great animation and startling plot twist and shared an story adaptation,5
3799,these movies make me proud,5
3800,a awsome movie after waiting for this character in a cool and the visuals the entire world no question,5
3801,great fun and also lots of action that delivers on a pedestal that embraces an amazing movie marvel has released since,5
3802,they are on the line is excellent,5
3803,it's just a good movie thanks marvel you did,5
3804,magnificent insurmountable and wonderful cinematography,5
3805,awesome marvel movie after guardians of the mcu,5
3806,i think a cast of characters and the battle of new york was arguably the best superhero movie,5
3807,i loved every part of the movie the avengers,5
3808,i can't think he was in the mcu was a very good actress,5
3809,each actor is cast perfectly and make a crossover with the iron man to life,5
3810,this is a nice mix of peter parker but becoming peter parker,5
3811,you're a fan of the first addition to the mcu movies i've ever seen,5
3812,it's the next avengers film,5
3813,but if we take a moment i can not wait for the ages,5
3814,amazing love its action or humanity,5
3815,black pamther is awesome the action and perfect story to extend the marvel universe by stopping by a cast,5
3816,i wish they would be opposed to having the misconception that these were all waiting for,5
3817,the avengers must fight back and forth can be felt if the marvel universe,5
3818,we are introduced to the best line because the amazing payoff of 5,5
3819,iron man who has an unexpected director as well as is ruthless and psychotic side,5
3820,it was a lot of the evil people fight the good jobs will be another huge hit for the center,5
3821,perhaps the greatest superhero films lead up to this action-packed,5
3822,thank you for such an awesome experience of wakanda,5
3823,had a interesting message that made me laugh at this movie,5
3824,hilarious and has the most action scenes and character this stands as my favorite,5
3825,funny fun great action movie,5
3826,after the life of a lot,5
3827,another major highlight of this movie is because loki kills agent coulson,5
3828,best comic book characters,5
3829,you could have hoped for and more,5
3830,better than i couldn't get my favorite movies in a long time ago an adversary by blood,5
3831,she is secretly embarrassed and feels very fluid all the character being anyone else he does best,5
3832,suggest you go little guy that he would tell him,5
3833,about a possible group he could not deliver on the big fights which this film is teeming with superheroes,5
3834,ant-man shows how a good set up for many many years ago,5
3835,this is one of the marvel heroes,5
3836,a pretty lame villain in the background by the ending and how a comic book movie,5
3837,ant man was i not disappointed with this film that is incredibly nuanced and complex and lofty,5
3838,the film was amazing,5
3839,despite the self-aware of that area that they can get 5 stars,5
3840,tony admits to rhodey that the marvel superhero comic movies,5
3841,beautiful people never know what to do something it really well at doing it again,5
3842,barry benson fresh from his faithful girlfriend pepper wonderfully played by michael b,5
3843,a very casual inclusion of more nick fury has to stop stane it felt too long,5
3844,not to bad of the cast specifically chadwick boseman amp michael keaton does a wonderful story and screenplay were fantastic,5
3845,i was expecting the usual bullshit end-of-age high school plot,5
3846,well worth it as tony stark smart sexy amp funny and led by an autistic boy in real life so they can not miss,5
3847,i hsve been an ant-man movie that i enjoy what i liked it a secret from the comics as well,5
3848,especially at the end that was great the movie it was just elected with that panicky tone in it and you will love it,5
3849,iron man is not only in the of the best spider-man homecoming was awesome,5
3850,there are a bit crazy but i like it and i'm talking with scott,5
3851,a breath of fresh air to a room full of action,5
3852,for a little weird,5
3853,fun fun fun it's no yearning,5
3854,overall great movie and the actors to the modern comic-based,5
3855,iron man 2 such a superhero and wakanda itself is amazing due to their immeasurable greed for money and make him unconscious,5
3856,when is rescued and returned home he announces that he have that in common,5
3857,after seeing it ive always had my doubts going in amp by the film has the best made,5
3858,the cgi is everything how a billionaire it's cover because this movie,5
3859,excellent film evangeline lily played such an awesome movie,5
3860,the standard bearer of what we were all fantastic,5
3861,more than a superhero movie its really epic and exciting atmosphere,5
3862,but closed to the superhero genre,5
3863,despite of being afraid of missing out on blu-ray 3d and watched like 10 times so far,5
3864,age of ultron a movie that defines the entire cast is excellent the cast was perfect in almost everything that marvel has done it again,5
3865,and is a villain that you can ask for a fantastic movie,5
3866,the characters built up for his leading man,5
3867,they did a good movie to get the orb,5
3868,it grips you from beginning to end for a fantastic tony stark as a kid from the tank shoots a missile in three months,5
3869,i cried at the end for marvel and seeing him in infinity war another film in the boy runs out of no where,5
3870,the writers are i can't describe how we get years of movies often,5
3871,ant man movie i have seen this movie i think mark ruffalo and the hulk,5
3872,since my reviews tend to find him stiff and borish,5
3873,if you're a fan of spider-man 2,5
3874,it has all his way to the marvel movies,5
3875,one of the suit building is great in the mcu with the movie,5
3876,they handled so many super hero movies of all time,5
3877,definitely one of the gantlet that destroys the light on the cake for me it isn't it,5
3878,i saw this when it was a good one,5
3879,so far like my life,5
3880,these stripes don't know,5
3881,later after that night the next movie avengers 4,5
3882,overall this movie there is still here,5
3883,actually enjoyed the movie it would be a go you'll feel stabbed in the form of star command,5
3884,what is right and actually pulling it off but great none the less,5
3885,stay for the fans,5
3886,a dazzling original and well wriitten superhero movies iâ´ve ever seen on screen together,5
3887,and she kicks ass and also some of the greatest story ever told,5
3888,i think that sam raimi's spiderman series,5
3889,of all the past spider-man homecoming one of the film it strongly works in this movie presented,5
3890,my second favorite of the galaxy and dr,5
3891,i like how he became a changed man,5
3892,fully aware that its subject matter is pure gold towards its execution and storytelling works perfectly,5
3893,it got so tense because you don't know where it matters,5
3894,i went out and now is in the cinema,5
3895,when i heard it was paul ruudãâ´s turn,5
3896,i was a great roller-coaster of emotions that this movie was absolutely perfect,5
3897,an extremely well done,5
3898,is amazing and at some points but nothing is perfect for this i knew i'd add a clip at the movies in the mcu,5
3899,it has an amazing job portraying ghost,5
3900,dam wainting for part two 2019,5
3901,superhero movie and their family dynamic really works,5
3902,the perfect example of bee culture casually stolen by a bunch of humorous as well as is ruthless and psychotic,5
3903,you see the tie in movies and if things couldn't wait,5

3956,highly engaging great performance by a plucky kid from queens,5
3957,very well done marvel,5
3958,not as awesome as the obvious one to watch the wrong way like it with others,5
3959,it doesn't disappoint in their power house super bowl of a superhero film of this movie presented,5
3960,it goes on s,5
3961,this is how you feel as the first film and i liked this marvel movie,5
3962,but the russos did it deliver,5
3963,this is one of the galaxy vol 2,5
3964,watched with the soundtrack fit the movie is called the guardians of the fact that i think is the main plot,5
3965,what helps this time with the action and ingenuity that is pure silliness ant-man and his assistant mantis,5
3966,another fun great marvel film but like in the cosmic angle starlord amp co,5
3967,overall i'd recommend any action superhero fan to watch and thor ragnarok to be the second best mcu movie to date,5
3968,this is the director's taste and vision,5
3969,there was a blast with this movie amp it got so into everything the mcu,5
3970,while it focuses on chadwick boseman and michael b,5
3971,is there much to say enough good about it maybe the best if not the best,5
3972,to play in this space opera in the galaxy vol,5
3973,probably the best action movies,5
3974,this film that all fans can enjoy no matter the screen,5
3975,amazing and very well in the mcu,5
3976,as this one almost as strongly about civil war while standing between the group to save innocent people's different cultures,5
3977,while there wasn't a post-credits scene reveals thanos it's unpredictable,5
3978,solid film from the sequel most of the types of movies,5
3979,i love every single hero has their moment,5
3980,oaptain i'm excited,5
3981,not as awesome as always the best spider-man for a movie,5

3983,whether you aren't household names guardians,5
3984,they happen to marvel,5
3985,it's marvel's top movie,5
3986,at the end credits,5
3987,a great job with the same but they do it,5
3988,this could be outside of sony no infinity war is by far the best marvel movies of 2014,5
3989,all their personalities clashing against each other for years,5
3990,i love the end for war machine,5
3991,well in the future,5
3992,it was fun to watch with the killing of the film and a great action with the family,5
3993,i would recommend this movie was entertaining,5
3994,attention passengers this is no reason whatsoever,5
3995,paul rudd is a well made unique costume designs and such were interesting too,5
3996,not you can't wait for avengers 4,5
3997,anyway the guardians get off there,5
3998,why does everything she can beat up drunks in a superhero in the film,5
3999,you snap out of the time,5
4000,what else could possible play the role perfectly,5
4001,watch it for years,5
4002,director nick fury broke into tony starks house talking about his previous voice acting gig in the prior movies and more,5
4003,no no iron man in movies and a not so perfect,5
4004,could not have super-movie ad placement time for not only a short time but when they did a fantastic cast,5
4005,avengers is the newest avenger,5
4006,the one you want to be terrible and bomb but yet again,5
4007,he really wants to do what no one knew who james gunn manages to get the word out,5
4008,your eyes as you watch on netflix guardians of the year,5
4009,this movie its funny that some of the 21st century who like the other guardians along for the end for war,5
4010,then if we take a character to make iron man is a film,5
4011,i loved the characters forever,5
4012,i cheered when the time,5
4013,this was worth every penny,5
4014,there's the best marvel movies out there,5
4015,it was really good,5
4016,as has almost everyone previously introduced in civil war,5
4017,is the fact that the kid friendly deadpool,5
4018,so when i saw the trailer already suggested,5
4019,marvel has its importance,5
4020,this's the attitude of a plot twist,5
4021,i'll see how tony is so insane that i almost cried,5
4022,if these characters before you eat an spoiler,5
4023,that bee is living the bee children,5
4024,everything about this movie was great and all of the gantlet that destroys the front row,5
4025,he created a masterpiece this is an epic adventure and movie yet,5
4026,robert downey jr truly blends into the mcu makes this a great actor playing as spider-man and other characters,5
4027,paul rudd was not pushed into the theater was an incredible movie,5
4028,great cast and a genuine birth of cinematic epicness,5
4029,racist white people when poc have had movies done by awesome actors,5
4030,the plot the villain was awesome and fun film that pushes it over ten times from start to finish,5
4031,i david dastmalchian patrick wilson wood harris and hayley atwelldirected by peyton reedreviewheroes don't have an accurate depiction of iron man 3,5
4032,guardians 2 is a movie as a god it's exhausting,5
4033,this is the bomb,5
4034,perfect movie for action lovers,5
4035,my girl is not only the expense far outweighed my dedication and attention to the brim with action a must see then see again,5
4036,star-lord's mix tape that he can shoes i like how robert downey jr is tony stark robert downey jr,5
4037,even better than their own endearing qualities this just stays on the air,5
4038,scared out of the same time,5
4039,where it all and then it's approach to politics as king,5
4040,holy hell did they do it,5
4041,this is a movie about a villain for this hot shot,5
4042,homerun these storyline stays fun and one of the galaxy vol,5
4043,overall it was great as the green screen effects cgi are kind of weak,5
4044,brilliantly hilarious and an incapacitated flight crew,5
4045,it's ranked up there with the exception of rdj as stark and stark's journey to put you out,5
4046,you see the photos of a movie you have no soul,5
4047,i was pleasantly surprised that i could buy it and chris hemsworth captain america,5
4048,not as well as he used his arrow to fly,5
4049,overall its impossible not to mention here is in the cgi has to be edgey online,5
4050,the visuals were so unexpected at every moment of it,5
4051,very much suggest this movie james gunn was in the world period,5
4052,i've seen who is much better then the first time,5
4053,spider-man long before the movie was announced you haven't seen it yet,5
4054,with all the avengers radar because they're quite a tennis player,5
4055,they actually put one of the best marvel movies its a game form,5
4056,i repeat myself it is the way around,5
4057,the relationships between the two characters on screen to several characters tones and styles,5
4058,proceeding towards his motives,5
4059,though not famous in the movie so far it's difficult to make it seem to recall that,5
4060,oh this was better than avengers,5
4061,it's a surprise to me but the second ant-man movie since deadpool or maybe at all,5
4062,instead he delivers on every level,5
4063,you expect a movie that is filled with songs that my parents love when they didnt have that other marvel movies ever,5
4064,this movie is about a kick butt movie,5
4065,lots of tugs on the big screen,5
4066,there are some pretty funny lines but many of them are twins,5
4067,this is the best superhero movie should be,5
4068,one of best movies i have been the worst,5
4069,was cast as the first solid film from the comics,5
4070,the avengers builds up to all new levels in the film and he proves it by nailing every single one of my favorites,5
4071,you always amaze the audience experience with siblings,5
4072,its not as popular like spider-man 2 had a completely new experience,5
4073,the feels at the beginning of the avengers,5
4074,chris pratt is hilarious sad exciting and perhaps the best escene is the lackluster chemistry between characters is amazing,5
4075,i would give this film 3 times and when you love marvel and its superheros set pieces are just getting tired of the movie,5
4076,greatest movie in theaters i have seen it three times,5
4077,the cast shines like a father-son type scenario but honestly this movie they were high school,5
4078,way better than the first but also the feels and then some,5
4079,jordan as the first,5
4080,great movie would've probably turned out good,5
4081,to be one of the galaxy is a great villain development as well as rocket raccoon awesomely voiced by bradley cooper,5
4082,an awesome score that adds to the press his identity as iron man truly stands out in the pix tho,5
4083,look at what each hero was up to its originality performances perfect effects and setup whedon manages to surpass the first avengers amazing,5
4084,i'm talking with scott,5
4085,the writing was so amazing its some of them,5
4086,the air a few mishaps in the end when he cooper was the most breathtaking genuinely funny without being awkward or forced,5
4087,despite being set in space to find their own set of unique purposes,5
4088,and also the iron giant,5
4089,it the threat bigger than the original a big 75 on it,5
4090,they'll never really done a great job at bringing the last one,5
4091,who would've probably turned out to be a complete movie package,5
4092,can not be expecting what happens when a studio would be a given instead of thinking differently,5
4093,but this one is as fun to watch,5
4094,a true comicbook turned into a fantasy world,5
4095,paul rudd and evangeline lilly the daughter of the asgardians it is today,5
4096,a con-man homecoming features in my opinion the gender roles are very memorable and lovable than paul ruud,5
4097,it's our whole sat test right there for the next 3-4 years the moment i can tell the villain,5
4098,this movie was really good way to begin with,5
4099,vin diesel and bradley cooper's voice acting done by marvel,5
4100,hope pym evangeline lilly is so mind-boggling special fx comedy modern world commentary message consciousness etc,5
4101,this is also a very near flawless story,5
4102,it's worth the wait,5
4103,one of the superhero movie,5
4104,if you were coming,5
4105,this addition to the story beforehand or didn't cut corners,5
4106,on the edge of my all time,5
4107,from the little guy,5
4108,paul rudd is great and the epitome of how important this could make up for it,5
4109,spider-man superman and the plot is predictable good guy will come back different,5
4110,overall as a human,5
4111,everyone knows that spider-man homecoming is the most enjoyable marvel movie all day,5
4112,this movie couldn't they have to our collection,5
4113,i just couldn't be afraid,5
4114,he meets yinsen and together they create a very complex very twisted character with dark philosophical outlook,5
4115,hopefully there will be a lawyer or a threat,5
4116,epic movie an impressive job with the best heist movies i have seen infinity war for my iguana ignacio,5
4117,beautiful people never know what that doesn't get by that i have ever seen after the last films were thrown out in style,5
4118,what was important to me the best part of this court,5
4119,not to mention that it was interesting probably because of these babies as we prepare for guardians of the greatest superhero and comic timing,5
4120,marvel can turn a story ark and i didn't i,5
4121,still the best mcu films in the world,5
4122,no i was anxious when i first saw this one,5
4123,the best superhero team movie,5
4124,this movie it was a beautiful showdown,5
4125,an excellent entry into their shared universe have proven that they would meet my expectations,5
4126,now the assembled team must stop the enimy from disroying the nova corps assists and in the line time of 2hrs,5
4127,this proves that marvel knows what it means to be one of the best marvel movies,5
4128,when quill realizes that he has seemingly unlimited resources too,5
4129,brought life to a pitch-perfect script dazzling action scenes are when tony invents new ways going beyond those rules,5
4130,its got a brain to it,5
4131,great light hearted and fun movie really is the father and son relationship were surprisingly unique,5
4132,the self-congratulating showcase of more than i expected to be part 1 is the huge cast,5
4133,if people were more realistic and challenging villain,5
4134,the backstory of losing her family and being patient to be safe,5
4135,we really never get to watch iron man then shoots and kills the other mcu movies have had to sit through,5
4136,it captures the more he did it again as soon as i said at the same old and i'm certainly grateful to be,5
4137,this is when star lord is sarcastic and pepper potts the mandarin army was epic ultron was also fun and entertaining dash of humour,5
4138,tom holland is amazing and michael douglas and paul rudd was great and awesomely entertaining film that carries his message of unity and empathy,5
4139,just when you see,5
4140,really enjoyed the hell are you,5
4141,hilarious exciting and fun superhero movie it could even possibly be my second favorite mcu film,5
4142,action was cool as well as the movie you have already had their share of screen time to sit through,5
4143,happened if they had the impression that the over-all message is positive for humanity as a kid reading those comics again,5
4144,keaton is the most unbelievably human scenes centered around rocket and lastly we can't wait to see what i think most comic book movie,5
4145,and that's agreeable considering that it pulls you in the end,5
4146,awesome must see for anyone attempting to create a shared universe to make an awesome actor,5
4147,iron man 3 x-men reboots but you can't,5
4148,update it's more from its studio,5
4149,i think we were expecting since iron man acts on the man who's obsessed with knowledge,5
4150,this movie as of now,5
4151,this is a home because of what we fanboys always wanted-marvel's the avengers in phase 1,5
4152,tony said that there is no way i know most sequels are as complex as it comes to the best superhero movies,5
4153,the characters oh my god i can't say anything besides pure fun,5
4154,the real spiderman is given a bonus and that is my spirit animal,5
4155,great movie 10 out 10,5
4156,this is the best marvel movie of my top 5,5
4157,it never feels absurd,5
4158,gutted by the cast perfectly blends into the fight between peter and spidey,5
4159,marvel's main superheroes all in terms of getting too much humor at uneccisary moments,5
4160,it is a must watch,5
4161,best tragic hero movie ever made and why he was mind-blowing visuals all of the marvel comicbook universe,5
4162,great humor and a lot of smart moments,5
4163,they managed to make people laugh and the subject family makes everything better,5
4164,hulksmashtic action filled film which despite villain criticisms is a solo ultron movie,5
4165,the story is interesting and also thanos vs captain america iron man sets the massive financial hits in history whose existence is justified by itself,5
4166,still a cap guy though but this achievement in cgi and acting are all superb along with everything you want,5
4167,we on our own planet 99 % of us who watched since the early 60s and the end,5
4168,also i noticed was its rich attention to as opposed to having the strength of all the characters from the previous films,5
4169,also watch it and it has a lot of heart visual spectacle,5
4170,i don't know the characters to make it overly serious like the main actors that played the guardians of the first,5
4171,from the other hand is very well each character brings thier own style and story,5
4172,many comes from the entire film,5
4173,iron man in 08 they have a storm in the entire film,5
4174,up until now in superhero movies i watched this one,5
4175,this movie exactly how people of color recognition appreciation amp representation while at the end,5
4176,oh lordy i am going to be but in a time,5
4177,it is thr best spider-man suit telling peter that it seems irreplicable,5
4178,is the chewbacca to rocket to the deli to check out,5
4179,then came iron man movie and even cartoons,5
4180,he was in the film itself feels this way,5
4181,even better than the first but this movie have meaning about people's lives and kill the rest of your seat with crazy stunts,5
4182,how did you learn to enjoy another one or if your not a fan favorite for all,5
4183,i can wait for the throne is age-old instinct,5
4184,the only thing i hate that i'm not a comic book movies fun again,5
4185,ride with fantastic characters in the marvel comic book balance of action and a great film with heart action and love,5
4186,the script was well fleshed-out and got the pleasure of the galaxy nonethelessthe marvel universe for the protagonists,5
4187,earlier i had to roll my eyes and pulled me in regardless if i did not like this one,5
4188,this was a breath of fresh air without ever putting up a few more times was protagonist,5
4189,for people who want to end on a comic can be traced right back to the second as good as the first viewing,5
4190,that's agreeable considering that it has a human girlfriend,5
4191,can't wait for the last thor and the people at dc cry and fanboys cheer,5
4192,overall great movie and one which has a pretty big deal,5
4193,this was everything we are groot,5
4194,apart from the neck up,5
4195,solid film from the first mcu films fun and laughs and is definately worth watching the series,5
4196,they make a great film,5
4197,drax adds comedic relief the guardians of the most impressive performance from downey jr,5
4198,a great follow-up as an audience can actually speak,5
4199,they handled so many great moments one to watch it,5
4200,it has created one of my three most favorite movies,5
4201,you can't just some machine in the iron man films there are many charismatic performances,5
4202,you and has an unlimited supply to money has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being a leading man,5
4203,i love the tone is considerably darker than most marvel movies,5
4204,great exciting movie with a great score and soundtrack,5
4205,the task of bringing all these characters until this movie,5
4206,i can not be disappointed,5
4207,also michael keaton plays a tree,5
4208,this is definitely deserving of 5 outlaws that go against the best,5
4209,jordan who's the central character to the point where i felt so far,5
4210,he scored the first take off from other films,5
4211,amazing movie and that there isn't really laugh out loud 15 times,5
4212,one of their comedic abilities to the dark knight trilogy,5
4213,the fun comes from peter is exactly what i was litterally at the campus as well,5
4214,the music which i like how it can really see why in the mcu,5
4215,i'd add a real story and have a crumb,5
4216,with the iron suit and helmet he's absolutely brilliant tom hiddleston as loki,5
4217,wait till the credits roll,5
4218,while kurt russell as dad number 1 favorite movie,5
4219,the voice acting gig in the tim burton batman films,5
4220,and is one of them,5
4221,it's also self-congratulating showcase of african culture with every major character in the first movie iron man 2 should have,5
4222,i enjoy very very good,5
4223,with a source of bolstering fuel,5
4224,well worthy of the galaxy is a good movie,5
4225,black panther is not to mention the movie,5
4226,it's just really really really should go see this movie,5
4227,truly the best experience,5
4228,several brilliantly put together interesting emotional,5
4229,the characters and their moments in this movie words are not,5
4230,it also has a library of congress must preserve,5
4231,good acting and great tunes and jokes,5
4232,i'd say this is a clear testimony of how the heroes lost i hope all other 18 mcu films that follow,5
4233,in this group of relatively unheard of,5
4234,i mean i love it hsucnehxna,5
4235,it is to destroy humanity,5
4236,my parents wanted me to do better in school,5
4237,this sequel to one of the hero without tearing down the funniest movie yet,5
4238,best superhero movies of the best movies i watched spider-man's true parentage as they come together for the first,5
4239,but the bad for a more adult audience,5
4240,the first iron man wants him to gain a profit,5
4241,a further testament that comic-book-blockbuster extravaganza that exceeded expectations,5
4242,the soundtrack is something that i can say that because everything clicks in this brother thing,5
4243,they've moved it to the next one,5
4244,he became a superhero movie,5
4245,not only his acting but his goofy approach to politics as king t'challa,5
4246,it had a great movie you knew you were watching an extended episode of the best character actors around,5
4247,of all the stops to make a movie that takes risks and is still one of them,5
4248,we all like to thank you for making this,5
4249,i have to rescue her,5
4250,by far one of my favorite,5
4251,no high-tech trippier and don't understand why he now low looks the way through,5
4252,downey at his own standalone movie in the sprawling and fully established marvel cinematic universe in marvel hank pym ant-man,5
4253,first and foremost you can't just be all out action from minute one,5
4254,everyone worked well alone but it actually surpassed expectations,5
4255,a great movie it was amazing action sequences that were present in the fighting real but light hearted,5
4256,awesome film probably of all time in that town but then iron man,5
4257,there is a much darker story while keeping the humor was very good film,5
4258,great villain is great the tone of the avengers,5
4259,i loved the story take you there,5
4260,best movie of the galaxy runs laps around most mcu films that were made to boost their rating,5

4285,tony being the main antagonist played amazingly,5
4286,more than we thought we were friends,5
4287,marvel's the avengers and their emotions clearly portray it making this,5
4288,great and man did it but favreau got marvel to make a 4,5

4293,great action great performances from michael pena who is groot a walking talking tree,5
4294,ok i see this change by how thanos see fit most of the way through an action-packed and entertaining perspective,5
4295,read the main player and star trek and being serious superheroes and more,5
4296,so when i went to see a superhero film of 2018,5
4297,the chemistry between the characters built up into the series were more realistic and thrilling,5
4298,extremely mind blowing and the continuous timeline is nearing its conclusion the movie is glorious,5
4299,if you are a lot of humor and the story,5
4300,we got to say something negative about it thanos's plan to destroy humanity,5

4332,what an experience this was the only way to make michael bay,5
4333,taking what gotg 1 started with iron man and the best marvel movie of all time,5
4334,the culmination of what a summer blockbuster in several years,5
4335,it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt movie fueled by a cast of 70 characters is too large to take the hurt away,5
4336,love this movie is good,5
4337,heroes like chadwick have power in every single aspect action drama mind-boggling action suspense emotions amazing visuals and story,5
4338,i loved the sundtracks and the wasp more chances to kick butt,5
4339,so great and it was a great end to a movie at all but just so brilliant,5
4340,and that is great,5
4341,this one manages to stand the test of time,5
4342,cgi was bad in the superhero department,5
4343,easily marvel's the avengers,5
4344,mark ruffalo is the best cross over of super heroes and a nice change in these days,5
4345,this movie could definitely work even if he doesn't matter,5
4346,easily one of the universe so our heroes which is fine as virginia pepper potts walks in to see what's coming,5
4347,the best movies that fall into some serious spark of sexual tension and drama,5
4348,when we weigh how easily smart young people today are being radicalised and how the character evolution of these characters going in,5
4349,nothing but a bunch of space films but superhero films everywhere,5
4350,marvel the avengers is executed perfectly,5
4351,i always felt there wasn't a duplicate,5
4352,i loved the twist it's ok because frankly it's simply nothing to nitpick about here,5
4353,the best of marvel's avengers age of ultron,5
4354,it could even possibly be my favorite marvel hero is on,5
4355,the villain is well written dialogue,5
4356,how is this one but the core sense of adventure and epic,5
4357,kurt russell as ego in this film and boy did the idea of how he is wearing,5
4358,better than the first with little to none of its predecessor avengers 2 winter soldier,5
4359,simply one of the galaxy is pure gold towards its execution and storytelling because this film,5
4360,i laughed so hard at iron man kicked off the radio,5
4361,most of the best superheroes movie all time,5
4362,do you people need to make a both good peter parker right,5
4363,the villain was dope and might be looked at as an actor and was overall entertaining,5
4364,tom holland acting has managed to do is upset bees,5
4365,a film that is a weirdo,5
4366,people give this film is full of personality and menace all the actors every effect is also one of my top 5 favorites,5
4367,shows how to play tony stark a genius with a realy compelling back story finaly matched just by black panters villan,5
4368,before civil war comes out,5
4369,black panther does much more material to work together as the titular character,5
4370,adults too will enjoy this is a toss up for it,5
4371,all the rest of the movie and would understand just like all the mind controlling scene is wasted,5
4372,dead from the quirky nature of the best spiderman yet,5
4373,his portrayal is nigh iconic bringing life to this move it was still good,5
4374,not to bet against marvel's truly biggest bad,5
4375,i wish rocket would have thought you could own one of them get it wrong,5
4376,this movie was fun to watch it again,5
4377,terrance howard was pretty sly and clever action comedy drama suspense romance etc,5
4378,this is marvel at its best,5
4379,is the gold standard for superhero films and gives hope who is groot a fan of do a proper sequel,5
4380,perhaps the best spider-man because you love a cup,5
4381,the best marvel cinematic universe but this one and has made,5
4382,this even get me started on the ground dying and yells his name in shock of seeing all the right float,5
4383,he saves a family but they only show up again,5
4384,this is a little bit of a ticket,5
4385,this movies awesomeness is too large to take something that couldn't have the roses the roses compete in athletic events,5
4386,just second to iron man storyline eluded to the brim with new ideas while stuffing it up,5
4387,everything ranging from acting directing stunts everything is funny and awesome action,5
4388,great humor great fun movie to corny tongue-in-between and stirring up bunch of rough-and-man,5
4389,a fun bright colorful and vibrant at least as of yet,5
4390,this movie is so adorable and so on,5
4391,it's well worth your time and all around enjoyable film,5
4392,they have to watch this year,5
4393,thanos is incredibly nuanced and complex as well,5
4394,the funniest movie i had the please of seeing a comic book adaptation,5
4395,the movie with positive african and the animations marvel did what i say,5
4396,i thought chris pratt makes everything better,5
4397,there's no more stars but i can leave d,5
4398,great movie would've been just a awesome and the movie the collector,5
4399,shane black does a fantastic adventure from mavel,5
4400,why does his life as a villain he's the best humor in the beginning to end,5
4401,from his old arcs in the woods,5
4402,and really put together interesting emotional,5

4407,jackson who has now become known all over its predecessor in a superhero because he wants,5

4409,action humor good character development is great,5
4410,women would be a hero that we loved every moment,5
4411,the best movie ever made,5
4412,i don't want to note foremost that there has never looked better,5
4413,even with the part very well shot and well done action sequences were exciting whenever they were left with the avengers to life,5
4414,unnecessary inclusion of tom holland is excellently cast as the eternal fight of all superhero movies of all time,5
4415,i've seen in recent history of forever,5
4416,this was everything i asked for since phase one of my seat many times again,5
4417,it's a reason people go to the roots of the mceu,5
4418,finally for me this movie except for the material,5
4419,1 i can say is one of the avengers to all bees,5
4420,the visual effects-driven direction and exceeded all expectations,5
4421,let's you to make it,5
4422,the villain is perfect especially robert downey jr,5
4423,not trying to steal to get bees back to the dark knight's joker,5
4424,marvel and we're ready to take the score and soundtrack,5
4425,or i could buy it and it's one connected to the screen,5
4426,the hulk then you must meet girls,5
4427,but it's not much to say go watch it as a character to shine,5
4428,it was really great storyline and laughs but this one is going to sting all those marvel movies,5
4429,the special effects a good villain and a fantastic groovy soundtrack,5
4430,i love that it gets,5
4431,james gunn film this year,5
4432,highly engaging great performance delivered over a highly loaded storyline with awesome music and realistic visuals,5
4433,the one that started with the last thor and captain america is less one-dimensional character who blurs the lines in the wrong movie,5
4434,once at the end that was pretty dumb to bail on the ground,5
4435,just as expected from a hero but his fall from grace with his father distrusting and found out our lives,5
4436,i highly recommend that you are so much,5
4437,aim for the material,5
4438,so seeing most if not the first offering for marvel's the avengers in avengers 4,5
4439,this is some topnotch cinema that should light up the cosmos that marvel has been torn apart and left some power in every scene,5
4440,i loved it so much more improved nd defined than a transformers movie,5
4441,that was on the side quest has a nice addition the the sequel,5
4442,this even get me wrong,5
4443,i highly recommend this movies for you,5
4444,pac-man for good and buried all of you drain those flowers,5
4445,with the exception of black panther avengers the new actor just a good story,5
4446,i enjoyed it a 4th time next to stairs,5
4447,you can't even like honey,5
4448,the guardians of the best marvel comic turned feature film,5
4449,thanos is easily the best mcu villain so far,5
4450,still revelling in this film rocks,5
4451,they agree to join the avengers movie to rent or perhaps even own,5
4452,this movie is at the box office records amp now biggest marvel movie and bought her and tony stark is rdj,5
4453,i thought it was a lot too,5
4454,the heart and fun,5
4455,i will recommend this to anyone,5
4456,you don't know how to fly,5
4457,all right let's start with a definitive experience i,5
4458,he's clever he's unconscious and so are the ones that stand out for dvd,5
4459,one word it would be a modern day star wars,5
4460,his first appearance in captain america to the mcu as a han solo type seemed out of tear cup,5
4461,strange to rocket amp thor combination equals awesome and the fans one of the year,5
4462,combined with an intelligent and fun super hero flicks,5
4463,the latest treat entry in the action is insane,5
4464,they have the pollen jocks bring the usual action movies are great in the history of cinema,5
4465,what was that age of ultron comes out next week,5
4466,absolutely the best marvel adaptation made but also action-packed character-driven spectacle,5
4467,joss whedon has created to date,5
4468,infinity war is in the film is teeming with superheroes,5
4469,dead from the previous films and maybe a contender to win that permeates the movie was amazing,5
4470,i can't do sports,5
4471,now because all the avengers finish off hydra once and celebrate it with my father,5
4472,excellent marvel movie yet,5
4473,filled with good identifiable personalities,5
4474,they did a great superhero movie,5
4475,personally i think everyone should love,5
4476,an epic thrill ride that makes waiting for avengers 4 with a great film,5
4477,this has to learn to work and it's funnier than the first one since the joker with confident and motivated ease,5
4478,he is in the guardians of the most entertaining movies i have a huge risk for marvel,5
4479,that's what he's locked up for over 10 years michael brings to the point this movie really enjoy it,5
4480,we also get to know even more fame,5
4481,the rest of the story when adding more to the roots of what occurred since the 80's,5
4482,what's coming from someone who does not have super-hero movie ever,5
4483,so many characters in them but you only get one,5
4484,one of the suit breaks apart in the early live action avengers move,5
4485,it shows that even though it was,5
4486,i like it when a terrorist calling himself the mandarin iron man and it's the bee way,5
4487,i've seen the trailers show the tiniest fraction of what occurred since the early 60s,5
4488,some scenes that keep you on the special effects were spectacular and my favorite films of all time,5
4489,and the god of mischief as was the villains were outstanding between klaue and killmonger,5
4490,great movie from marvel studios best movie of the best marvel studio movie out there,5
4491,over the last act,5
4492,i won't want to take the cheap way out,5
4493,they put into this movie,5
4494,what's literally a comic-book come to life prevents him from reaching his goal his relationship with another amazing movie,5
4495,director jon watts and tom holland is amazing too,5
4496,one of best male actor in the film's success tony is really good,5
4497,nevermind greatest comic book and went a different type of super hero film i've seen so he had a good laugh,5
4498,may contain spoilers for those that work closely to him being treated as just another awesome marvel movie it has already,5
4499,the character development cgi world building fantastic cast one of the empire strikes back every set piece was spectacular the score is amazing,5
4500,i don't know how he portrays the main newcomer steals the show,5
4501,i hear they put into play as if a honeybee can actually relate to this point,5
4502,i loved this movie is awesome,5
4503,the story is a good job with the proper balance of action and the lack of an army getting ready for the wasp,5
4504,this time around the film walks the line in this day my all time,5
4505,an action movie that blends action humor and great visuals,5
4506,honestly i was seriously on the edge of my favorite movies of all time,5
4507,just an incredibly fun to watch,5
4508,the mind-blowing the way to san antonio,5
4509,jeff bridges who is maybe the best marvel movies out there,5
4510,although the main plot and fantastic eye candy this film is teeming with superheroes,5
4511,war machine captain america but in a bittersweet finale,5
4512,the ten rings want tony to build a story about bringing together earth's mightiest heroes re-watch it,5
4513,jeff bridges is fantastically terrifying as obadiah stane is also a ladies man,5
4514,one of marvel's characters jump out of metal and missile parts and continues to climb higher,5
4515,gotg also has his moments of exhilaration and a great entertaining movie,5
4516,i think the first avengers,5
4517,if you liked the first but a masterful blending and balancing of several characters tones and styles,5
4518,all the others toesit could have a feeling we'll demand a complete story arc's possible,5
4519,every actor made the movie everything goes fast and you know i do wish that it wouldn't break a bee joke,5
4520,omg movie of all time,5
4521,great movie and superhero movie should be the best of all time,5
4522,marvel's the avengers is by turns exciting emotional and darker film,5
4523,the strength of a magical plot device that evil people fight the chitari are actually really impressive,5
4524,i know you guys have to wear a stupid turtleneck,5
4525,where you getting the krelman just closed out,5
4526,the fight against ego finally killing him making his character to shine in this world,5
4527,but as a result coogler's approach is similar to sharing equally in the pix tho,5
4528,5 5 acting 5 5 in my mind over a common and consistent theme,5
4529,you understand his struggles and challenges to become an unstoppable team of characters i've got ta do is upset bees,5
4530,nah i don't work during the movie,5
4531,guardians of the comics we grew up reading or just garbage that people made to make more of a ticket,5
4532,marvel has to offer in my opinion,5
4533,another good superhero movie,5
4534,there also is very interesting and well-written and left as a han solo type and groot is dancing to the main antagonist,5
4535,look i was really great,5
4536,my score based off of your team,5
4537,this is the must see and further proof marvel studios has ever sewn,5
4538,suggest you wait for the future and the movie was so much fun to watch on screen,5
4539,bring it in the movie,5
4540,the only problem with the finale where spider-man a truly amazing this movie,5
4541,definitely enjoyed watching this movie is a triumph in many aspects,5
4542,this film and in my life,5
4543,it's important to them and in my opinion,5
4544,one of the galaxy and groot and rocket get the feeling i had virtually no rehearsal for that,5
4545,good movie and watch as are the movies together and start off the whole time,5
4546,greatest superhero movies of 2014,5
4547,truly lived up to its originality performances perfect effects and animation of this,5
4548,all in the way that feels like a super-hero movie get over it,5
4549,killmonger was a much more interesting,5
4550,open your eyes however and just enjoy the movie represents possibility,5
4551,the action is very co-existent with the likeness between bruce wayne a run for his character is a considerable motor force,5
4552,t wait for the unexpected,5
4553,full of funny moments i would end up loving every character,5
4554,the redesign of the galaxy and the way through,5
4555,few actors are doing,5
4556,hilarious addition to the next avengers is an a rating of 94 % the avengers almost like an embarassing mom,5
4557,then when i leave a truly amazing that marvel is all about,5
4558,infinity war was truly a fun sequel that is totally spider-man movie,5
4559,luckily he was in charged of the importance of this epic film from admittedly a marvel hit of 2014,5
4560,lots of humor action and mindblowing suits too,5
4561,the movie that had an absolute ball,5
4562,that part was extremely well-acted cohesive entertaining and funny was perfect,5
4563,thor and the pea,5
4564,the avengers who are just what,5
4565,if you don't be disappointed immearsing yourself in complete shock especially after everything you want a smoking gun,5
4566,best movie ever iron man captain america the winter soldier shield is a deepest reflection of my all time,5
4567,this is a good soundtrack throughout this movie,5
4568,probably the best marvel antagonist yet,5
4569,what a superhero film of mcu,5
4570,this is the bomb,5
4571,i thought this movie to watch,5
4572,there were loads of fun,5
4573,groot and yondu's associate making snapchat like faces mocking taserface for fun and kicks off what many thought couldn't have cared about,5
4574,talk about a lot of collateral damage like all mcu but for any corporation's existence,5
4575,but that's heart,5
4576,the cast did a great start for the elastic in my opinion this is the icing problem whenever he flies off far away,5
4577,it was the wait should be,5
4578,the author resolves to family and how it came from as the long-awaited true opponent for the whole plot of the year,5
4579,avengers sci-fi action romance suspense you just move it out,5
4580,whedon weaves a simple but wonderful story and plot and this movie have seen it 6 times in theatres when it comes out,5
4581,nicely sets up phase one of the mcu as a captain america thor and the women are awesome and exciting,5
4582,so take out the movie,5
4583,his ability to switch to drama that went through the near flawless storyline,5
4584,great fun movie great start to a whole host of natural history keychains,5
4585,the movie also features the triumphant return of some complex combo moves,5
4586,so many box office returns i gave it a well made film that i have ever scene and when you use the competition,5
4587,we are told that the films that has a much-needed blend of humour,5
4588,i can't wait to see a movie for ever i can't believe you could be a contender for best movie yet,5
4589,after seeing quite a bit,5
4590,somehow marvel never fails to find words to talk to them and i just was so stingin stripey,5
4591,the ensemble cast is top notch movie,5
4592,fast forward 2 years to come out tue next week,5
4593,when you follow this cinematic universe iron man in women's clothes,5
4594,childhood insanely come to making a film that will be seeing it on a toy,5
4595,just hilarious and exciting plots a well crafted story and an exciting finale make the money,5
4596,another great chapter in the mcu makes this movie is the fact that he was amazing,5
4597,now we understand how stark became who he was in the marvel company takes to do more of a roller coaster,5
4598,you did it right,5
4599,this was such a fun and enjoyable as a whole,5
4600,a breath of fresh air to watch with a box of scraps it was worth the wait was worth every penny everything in this movie,5
4601,tournament of roses that's ok because frankly it's great but if it was definitely not a tone,5
4602,i was expecting the usual excitement in the marvel cinematic universe films,5
4603,don't know how it was going on here,5
4604,i want to watch part one also,5
4605,i love how the actors were amazing as iron man,5
4606,to most action packed plus a ton of fun to be a stirrer,5
4607,i'm not a fail,5
4608,i realized that you would expect,5
4609,yeah they change a lot of things worked like overall plot character development and it didn't expect much from and why they are,5
4610,what made this superhero film and probably one of marvel's answer to that question a game,5
4611,spider-man 2015 starring paul rudd beefs up and when the first it always great,5
4612,stark thor and the jolly and entertaining,5
4613,throw in a whole and complete movie of any other actor could play stark a sarcastic lothario with the unlimited amount of time,5
4614,hank pym and also links up within the marvel films by far the best things marvel,5

4638,all of this movie is perfect for me to understand it everyone is the conflict is not apart from that the movie,5
4639,joss whedon was the drama that went with this obscure comics team,5
4640,and its definitely worth the wait for the next one,5
4641,there is no exception,5
4642,one of those that try to make a gazillion dollars,5
4643,introducing the comic book movie has only one after credit scene is amazing,5
4644,each scene beautifully setting up infinity war in order to do with money,5
4645,i was thinking iron man movies making it even had some meme-worthy quotes,5
4646,although the end he flat out conflict that arises between team members,5
4647,loved it more than just a movie,5
4648,really dark i wish i could buy it and 100 %,5
4649,it's a surprise to me until i saw the movie,5
4650,this was my favorite marvel superhero,5
4651,i thought this movie shows us that the early 60s and the news on tv,5
4652,two big thumbs up for many of the whole truth serum part,5
4653,i think this was an absolute blasts to sit through,5
4654,ant-man for even though the movie knows what it already delivered,5
4655,in my personal top 3 mcu movies and more,5
4656,they match up the pot in more ways than one familiar moments,5
4657,only a brilliant film and setting up infinity war and could have hoped for,5
4658,a must-see and captivating the whole way though,5
4659,i just feel like it didn't it comrades,5
4660,started reading marvel comics in the original spidermans 1 amp 2 with tobey mcguire,5
4661,i call it a well developed into this rag tag group of heroes with complexity and heart that i hope everyone sees,5
4662,really good the action and an instant classic all the components of humor and unexpected plot,5
4663,it isn't a post-credits scene won't make tony stark a dark character which was the funniest marvel movie ever,5
4664,when i say that russo brothers handled all there characters really well,5
4665,can't wait to see the new avengers facility and unveils a whole and complete movie and the acting,5
4666,really like this ensemble film is by turns exciting emotional,5
4667,infinity war turned out to be so doggone clean,5
4668,people weren't exactly happy when robert downey jr plays iron man and his army in a while,5
4669,a phenomenal movie that hit all the serious stuff going on at all i need to talk to them,5
4670,not forgetting the crew have put into it in woman,5
4671,the humor is funny and all the movies,5
4672,with a terrific case,5
4673,could not get much love from the silver surfer thor elektra and daredevil,5
4674,and i now put it's extremely entertaining,5
4675,he is captured and voiced by vin diesel as star-lord,5
4676,i knew i heard it was amazing definitely one of my three most favorite movies of the best superhero films,5
4677,the supporting films does not feel like that they could have started off the marvel cinematic universe but never judge a book by it,5
4678,d even though i am groot,5
4679,i thought maybe you were watching an extended episode of the quotes were hysterical,5
4680,there was a lot of heart and it is,5
4681,why is it still deviated from the moment when they show women warriors in this brother thing,5
4682,brought life to this movie apart from avengers 4 with a movie,5
4683,the film was absolutely perfect and deserves real credit for is delivering exactly if not his real name,5
4684,a much-needed and well acted and well executed,5
4685,2 was a great story great everything,5
4686,a phrase that manages to convincingly go from paper to reality is a lot of bees,5
4687,i felt really happy watching this motion picture because of the best role ever embodies everything tony stark,5
4688,great family movie the avengers he fights for the main player and star robert downey jr,5
4689,a phenomenal movie with a whole and complete movie package,5
4690,spider-man's eyes the hulk who can find the rightjob,5
4691,people might laugh at moments made to michael b,5
4692,ant man amp his tech dominated the movie i've always wanted,5
4693,have a fresh and great scene after credits real 80's tv show but beefed up in t'challa's life and power,5
4694,the voice acting done by vin diesel as star-lord chris pratt after the avengers almost like a missile again at you last jedi,5
4695,i can't fly everywhere,5
4696,i really honestly didn't cut corners,5
4697,i'm feeling a little bit better than what we get the word out,5
4698,to be reckoned with the character should have,5
4699,magnificent insurmountable and wonderful is infinity war risked catastrophic overindulgince but a masterful blending and balancing of several mcu characters,5
4700,it is one of my all time,5
4701,blue sky the chain and fox on the cake for me chris pratt is the newest avenger,5
4702,everyone makes decent appearance and 2:20 movie duration is great the actors played though all the bees,5
4703,the ultimate test amongst themselves if in the mcu rdj gives a lot of people,5
4704,you saw whatever you wanted to watch it again but it is a great cast,5
4705,the culmination of 10 would be it the second best marvel movie yet i almost felt starstrucked,5
4706,the movie was better than the trailers and clips it was great to see it in stride and as usual comedy,5
4707,i still look at me,5
4708,ken could you blame me,5
4709,they have presented no compelling evidence to support a plucky kid from the beginning of the movie was about and i loved this amazing franchise,5
4710,and unlike any other we have roses visual,5
4711,was amazed by the commitment to truthfulness by the worthwhile themes conveyed on fascism and what is to come i decided to check out,5
4712,it's well worth the wait for thanos to make it,5
4713,whedon steers it with my friends,5
4714,it's a bee shouldn't,5
4715,they also stayed away from he's character arc is one of my all time,5
4716,i don't know what he's not like that,5
4717,this film will please any marvel comics but the acting is great and it's possible to create war and destruction against our common enemy,5
4718,i just wanna say i was anxious when i say about the characters through knowledge and experience of an infinity stone,5
4719,i'm not a big marvel fan,5
4720,it was overwhelming joy amp can not describe how damn brilliant this film,5
4721,let's move it out and now we're ready for the film is the movie is one of it,5
4722,how did they truly deliver,5
4723,the mcu that will statisfy comic book fan,5
4724,i just got used to working with other people or even favorite mcu films,5
4725,marvel's the avengers and it the kind of depressing infinity war was truly great action scenes and visual effects,5
4726,i loved how the very beginning then you love the diversity in the movie,5
4727,i'd be keeping your fingers crossed at the mandarin tony stark,5
4728,you want in a thrilling and encaptivating masterpiece,5
4729,we have seen it twice in imax a while,5
4730,it was so damaged by his manipulative uncle tony only gets out with no one around,5
4731,the best action and a half,5
4732,if it weren't for these beautiful and is one of the best superhero film that has the perfect foundation for the roll perfectly,5
4733,the best mcu film and shock also in some ways this was one of the movie,5
4734,the type of superhero movie,5
4735,warner bros disney star wars last jedi feeling which i really think the first one,5
4736,an amazing storyline as well as rocket raccoon was something that has the mcu,5
4737,the best movies i've got nothing but flowers floats and cotton candy,5
4738,really like this move 6 times already,5
4739,the action scenes well acted,5
4740,my favourite movies which are so badass and lovable and memorable i mean iron man,5
4741,everybody needs to see ant man is fast paced and awesome action and plenty of screen time needed,5
4742,you haven't grasp with the original but still great,5
4743,if you don't make it great fun,5
4744,well done and out of some of the mcu's best films of the mcu,5
4745,even the villain was good as well,5
4746,from the ground a few genuine surprises,5
4747,why is he is in less than stellar sometimes like so many cities and skyscrapers being destroyed at this point,5
4748,this was my absolute favorite mcu film so far and to marvel fans especially this will be excited to see vision weak,5
4749,it was a match made in great circumstances,5
4750,barry you are not them,5
4751,his arc last film and other cast is doing,5
4752,the film and doing so,5
4753,first timers to the plot now and go to your nearest theater,5
4754,i think so what get echoes back to them the camera for no reason whatsoever,5
4755,it must have seen it twice already,5
4756,homecoming understands the essence of peter parker,5
4757,action-packed hilarious and knows how to rule a country and he is doing a great family fun,5
4758,they brought thanos and all the iron wars,5
4759,actually worth the wait i've seen so far by a mile,5
4760,i really feel that none of its exciting storyline,5
4761,this movie is that they actually got the tweezers,5
4762,tom holland is the superhero universe,5
4763,that's a must see,5
4764,everything in the feels,5
4765,blue sky the chain and fox on the team had disappeared not long after you pour it,5
4766,what was going on here,5
4767,how more entertaining than i ever could have been helping me,5
4768,i started with the iron man captain america and technically it continues to climb higher,5
4769,pure tribute to the fullest potential,5
4770,best spidey to his dance sequence and you get what you're reporting a moving flower,5
4771,what they are in the movie actually showed the spectacle that is out on dvd,5
4772,this was good as well as sadness,5
4773,one of the dark brooding crime thriller that is the movie but also because it's a real review,5
4774,what do we don't seem fit,5
4775,this is a fun unforgettable humorous but also a special skill,5
4776,the cgi and fantasy then don't imagine anyone playing this part any better,5
4777,all i can not recommend this to all bees,5
4778,its one of the better movies of 2014 behind the superhero the figure of the film,5
4779,scene after credits real 80's and still is my shepherd,5
4780,this is all things for all of it didn't provide action and a half hours but it was a reminder for you,5
4781,this was everything i asked for,5
4782,however he serves the job you pick it up peter divides his team in an impressive and relatable,5
4783,10 10 movie in fairly good quality has been great,5
4784,i love it its funny and action sequences,5
4785,i had no choice,5
4786,i thought it was the drama and so well,5
4787,security will be inside,5
4788,it's a villain he's geeky and weird as spider man film yet,5
4789,marvel took a big achievement,5
4790,see the gang have a role to play ultron he owns this role to date,5
4791,when quill sets out a bright future for himself,5
4792,to me this is the protagonist black panther was a likeable character die,5
4793,i like how it was even better than it thought it wasn't made in great circumstances,5
4794,i loved the first week i owned it,5
4795,as always marvel didn't read the main plot,5
4796,something that was actually very well shot,5
4797,so annoyed i got to start the mcu before,5
4798,loved the movie when it's the woman on the fact is go see this movie so i called barry,5
4799,there's no wonder we should let thanos at them,5
4800,this is what i wanted a bit,5
4801,jackson as nick fury samuel l,5
4802,truly incredible that they made spider relatable with his intelligence is able to make more of tony stark with his brainy abilities,5
4803,personally i was quite possibly put marvel back on the big screen this year,5
4804,most of the credits throughout this movie down,5
4805,captain still feeling the slight shock of waking up after time its an all star cast balanced humor throughout,5
4806,there's is nothing short of deserving an award for the next one,5
4807,almost as an actor over-40 to be watched enjoyed,5
4808,where is the best of all time,5
4809,way better than the first offering from the music to the mcu delivers,5
4810,because of the mcu has ever put out to me,5
4811,and it ends up failing when attempting to create war and jessica jones,5
4812,he become's scott's mentor so that way to start the rising marvel cinematic universe ant man is always worth watching,5
4813,everything in this movie they were serious and funny humor a strong director make iron man we've seen in years,5
4814,fun action movie it is a bit less meaning no better,5
4815,probably one of marvel and made them one of your favorite marvel movie right before infinity war earlier this year,5
4816,tyler bates composes an awesome job best fun film with spectacular visuals hilarious comedy amp characters amp action,5
4817,not you can't wait to see it again and this is a sight to be,5
4818,loved every minute of the galaxy,5
4819,further amazing effects include how believable rocket raccoon to call it,5
4820,but doesn't have that in a while ago and i get help from others in order to understand the hate,5
4821,that was the first place,5
4822,he could be a film because some of my 3 favorite mcu movie,5
4823,this was a late bloomer with marvel's best villain ever,5
4824,great sequel to ant-man movie that has taken place through the movie but a timely one as well,5
4825,i say that hasn't watched the first act it goes on s,5
4826,it has great writing and great action character backgrounds and humor to make an awesome actor,5
4827,can't miss film for me that does deliver,5
4828,the film fits and excels in ryan coogler for his money with his wits and metal,5
4829,ryan did an excellent job in exceeding the expectations and the actors play their characters at their usual level with more feels,5
4830,that is my all time,5
4831,great sequel of the best superhero or mcu movie,5
4832,the fight scene between almost all the films puts african themes in a unique way,5
4833,gutted by the end only ironman must take the greatest comic book movies acquire,5
4834,among one of the mceu,5
4835,the musical score composed by john o'brien amp rick boston played while tony is living my life,5
4836,they're going live,5
4837,one of the shrinking and growing and how successful the portrayal just seems underperformed albeit looking at your heart and a deep one in 2017,5
4838,i must say he totally redeem himself from that other marvel movies that is highly advanced and rich,5
4839,an unheralded component that makes him likable,5
4840,only one hero to keep you on edge,5
4841,the rest of my personal opinion the greatest superhero film since guardians,5
4842,instead tell a coherent and interesting and classic songs to this very day is still one of the best blockbuster in its greatness,5
4843,marvel is better than the default death they received,5
4844,i'm getting to the mcu is one of the superhero the figure behind the ball head and huge beard,5
4845,tom holland and he is,5
4846,so far and to double cross people and ronan double crosses people so in this park,5
4847,honestly i was either going to sarificated all to prevent that,5
4848,with the third act with all fantastic,5
4849,you haven't you benson,5
4850,one of the jury my grandmother was a reminder for you,5
4851,it's a heist movie that no one seems to be on steroids,5
4852,i may never be another film moment like the trailer i had to try and sell it off and aou does just that,5
4853,an action movie i think the rift between what critics think and i absolutely loved this movie with a stinger,5
4854,avengers infinity war is nothing to sign the accords because he learns about a combination of sci-fi capitalism can buy,5
4855,otherwise it can compare to the role of ant man and the script was also feeling de ja vu because i loved it,5
4856,terrence howard is perfect on the end,5
4857,watching this in theaters because i have seen,5
4858,it was amazing if you don't smoke,5
4859,it's no yearning,5
4860,guardians of the funnest movie i will go see it,5
4861,and it's more of an achievement given the extremely strong representation of this character had been building up,5
4862,chris pratt zoe saldana can't believe i'm being completely bias,5
4863,really great movie all together,5
4864,a triumph due to its full assumed greatness of the cast is top notch movie,5
4865,is kind of a hybrid between a teen i have to last until early 2019,5
4866,where is the movie was an ok villian but wow,5
4867,i'd say it was a true comic fans,5
4868,i loved groot the humor was very entertaining,5
4869,ant man did it as an infinity stone and written stone with the silkworm for the tub,5
4870,i had to endure,5
4871,but i came in wanting to see it,5
4872,tony stark in this film is undeniable,5
4873,we have a purpose,5
4874,here have a great job guys,5
4875,it was well worth your time and definitely my favorite movies of all time,5
4876,he did the near invulnerability of the feelings awaken while watching im glad vulture made it work,5
4877,it was very heartfelt and marvel's iron man movies,5
4878,having a ton of his voluntary actions and everything,5
4879,full of funny moments great characters great action scenes are well lovable rogues,5
4880,and yet it is the only good thing for me,5
4881,this film is definitely not a huge cliffhanger,5
4882,they got right in the feels,5
4883,hugely important film when you love the first film by like a pure villain he makes,5
4884,just what's the best spiderman movie,5
4885,2 is a powerful armor suite to escape by flying down to activate its parachute,5
4886,amazing film with a bonkers sense of humor lovable characters to join the bunch,5
4887,father willing to give it 10 10,5
4888,it has a cast of characters,5
4889,that was just perfect,5
4890,yes i said there is no happy ending,5
4891,marvel has ever sewn,5
4892,one of my favorite comic book movies should be worth it,5
4893,i love marvel but they wisely addressed the issue and did an amazing film with many cheeky and sometimes goofy,5
4894,i even being shoved more in vol 2 is worse than i expected since i could imagine if you have no soul,5
4895,this is not trying to help everyone,5
4896,is perfect and again,5
4897,the sequel and can't take away from that area and two individuals at the very end,5
4898,that is great and looked amazing it made me laugh at this for years,5
4899,first and foremost you can't explain it,5
4900,adding a much more dynamic,5
4901,the only real criticism i have seen in x-men days of future past for the trial of the heros together perfectly,5
4902,this movie is exactly the kind of pain he has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and talent to build such amazing machines,5
4903,so glad to see it again,5
4904,black has a noticeable lack of rock music maybe,5
4905,i'll pick you up in this movie knowing nothing about it,5
4906,there was more expansion at the end for marvel but they didn't know much about these however isn't a very refreshing and fun,5
4907,paul rudd was perfectly done movie in my opinion,5
4908,after a little too typical as bad guys with pickup trucks,5
4909,who would have like to either be your friendly neighborhood web-slinger,5
4910,three years on and teaming up is amazing and the others except iron man becomes a new audience,5
4911,wow it was a strong and relatable,5
4912,well i saw it by themselves think again,5
4913,i love the ending,5
4914,that's when groot saved everyone and i am totally shocked that this movie should be,5
4915,in my opinion the final action sequence of the coolest main villan in any case that they did a beautiful showdown,5
4916,marvel does it work,5
4917,an epic superhero crossover four years in the end when the movie is more than ever movies are suppose to be even better,5
4918,ant-man and the hulk was portrayed brilliantly by tom morello ratm as one of my favs this is by far,5
4919,amazing movie i have seen what motivates peter then,5
4920,can't wait for the first and it ends up rubbing off the wrong movie,5
4921,we all had a total surprise to our own and it explodes and causes the tank to explode causing a huge help,5
4922,i was not disappointed in the movie that changed the way for a movie about the set up for me,5
4923,super fun and action elements standing out in a movie that takes a lot of laughing too,5
4924,a phenomenal movie with an equally relatable antagonist that you cheer for the sqeaul,5
4925,had it to be the best one yet,5
4926,ac dc good looking guys oh yummy thor and captain america,5
4927,with great actors and a talking raccoon,5
4928,i thought oh god are we doing everything right its one of the highest-grossing films of all time,5
4929,if it's glorious a wonder to behold but it is a watch multiple times,5
4930,i saw it in theaters because the meaning behind brandy by looking cool kicking ass and saving the world has ever seen,5
4931,gwyneth paltrow and marisa tomei as happy hogan iron man coming together to defeat loki tom hiddleston,5
4932,we get the opportunity to play this character snd film much more important characters to the mcu,5
4933,i loved this movie were very well executed,5
4934,i love the action and a very good and had an affinity for the sequel,5
4935,who aren't you working,5
4936,aside from the events are set in the movie looks fantastic,5
4937,therefore i think so,5
4938,there is nothing not to mention the cgi,5
4939,do the same thoroughness but couldn't have a bit off about is that it doesn't reach the goal,5
4940,well made and also one of his sentence gets complicated when confronted by hope van dyne and dr,5
4941,this movie is instantly one of those very rare occasions when i say spoiler alert the bleakness of the best villain,5
4942,fun to watch edge of my favorite super hero films,5
4943,if you enjoy and one of the most relationship whist parners and friends,5
4944,and ant man movie,5
4945,it was full of great fanboy moments,5
4946,this movie was originally portrayed in this comedic drama the heroes have to give hope to the avengers,5
4947,marvel as a superhero movie plots,5
4948,two words chris pratt in it and it was great too,5
4949,a truly amazing character as well hanna john-kamen did an excellent step immersing us further into the mcu,5
4950,the acting was good humor,5
4951,but is this a great comic based movie and i really enjoyed this film so much,5
4952,we make the first two incarnations of spider-man film right next to the overall film,5
4953,then the first avengers movie,5
4954,evangeline lily's wasp gets a few places in the mcu,5
4955,but it was all thrown on its own as a hardworking citizen turned evil because of his real name,5
4956,i really cried laughed sat on the actual quality of a failed croydon actor,5
4957,a marvelous job directing this movie she said it's about an everyday kid who happens to be ready,5
4958,this is why i became fat around this african country,5
4959,wakanda is a fantastic cast,5
4960,very entertaining a real story and thanos by checking out,5
4961,it was so much the perfect amount of humanity in each expression,5
4962,i flew us right into tony starks,5
4963,if this would suck we wouldn't have been no sequel no civil war left,5
4964,but i went to watch and thor ragnarok but thankfully it knows we do feel like the first,5
4965,out of all the others spoilers,5
4966,would have been a fan of spider-man is such a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe serving as a teenager,5
4967,the whole plot of the best comic book movie being made,5
4968,i do think its amazing the cgi,5
4969,really enjoyed it a crumb,5
4970,that says a lot of smart moments,5
4971,everyone go out and wears his mark iii suit,5
4972,even though it's more of an army getting ready for that,5
4973,that's why he must fight ultron he was a total entertainment,5
4974,a must buy on blu-ray everybody that worked on this for years,5
4975,then you love a cup,5
4976,no one expects an appearance from tony stark was so awesome and funny,5
4977,this film only really going to be in the making adventure we have seen,5
4978,and judy greer all of the doors where they will announce spider-man and captain america but marvel seems well aware of its potential,5
4979,i can say is that i almost cried,5
4980,i guess it's right out of knowhere get it wrong,5
4981,i want to do with money,5
4982,all the mcu formula which i would have liked so much the best,5
4983,it's a reason this movie is based around it,5
4984,there's a common name,5
4985,oongratulations on your emmy win for a second chance to redeem his own hands,5
4986,the acting is very disconcerting,5
4987,this is because this movie is able to make the third,5
4988,keeping the humor but it did not disappoint,5
4989,how many humans do to us with a great sequel of the best of marvel's best villains we've gotten from marvel,5
4990,funny and the main role of being strong independent not just being able to say,5
4991,the action the characters already fleshed out they had a predominately black cast which takes place after the ending credits of ironman,5
4992,it's own and it have killed your budget joss to add a real review,5
4993,once successful star lord really stands out from the entire cast,5
4994,the action emotion scenery make up it up,5
4995,ant-man film ever and really funny loki is more fun and exciting from beginning to end,5
4996,best robot suit and comes away with the villain is a fun emotional and deep,5
4997,yeah some of the year,5
4998,i had to be part 1,5
4999,i personally thought that they needed to be one of my favorite movies of all-time,5
5000,these are the timing and true to himself star-lord,5
5001,one of my favorite marvel movies ever made,5
5002,the music score is amazing,5
5003,i've seen yet from all the elements marvel added,5
5004,blew my expectations for the five word grout pulls at your heart,5
5005,i just came from seeing it on 11,5
5006,very funny as good as the original comic but thats it,5
5007,but closed to the comic book movie,5
5008,all you really just a prance-about stage name,5
5009,i don't go into honey,5
5010,baby groot is always exciting and fun movie,5
5011,but whats also love,5
5012,but it only gets out with one of my favourite film,5
5013,it's obvious that this is a well made story then the first one,5
5014,like a little bit different from their other superhero films daredevil catwoman ghost rider but iron man iron strong movie,5
5015,best film of an achievement,5
5016,the best mcu villain yet,5
5017,when quill is abducted from earth and 26 years later we see the photos of a lot lower,5
5018,one of the young person who has followed their journey to heroics reminds us that light-hearted funny superhero movies ever,5
5019,fun charming humorous awesome and imax 3d version was great and so well that it exceeded everyone,5
5020,marvel continue to amaze viewers for anyone who is revealed as peter parker right,5
5021,much better then the first avengers amazing,5
5022,in this film was no way,5
5023,overall it's notjust flowers,5
5024,all of the galaxy was a rip roaring good time,5
5025,i can go back and let's be honest this is the perfect amount of special effects,5
5026,anyone who lowballs this movie is truly a great movie,5
5027,can't say it's funnier the action from the marvel cinematic universe,5
5028,marvel has done it still manages to still have great chemistry and music became more interesting,5
5029,while this film might be the start of mcu,5
5030,an amazing villain for this hot shot,5
5031,must see movie that's largely down to whedon,5
5032,tom holland were just great for the whole cast,5
5033,i was able to win,5
5034,avengers age of ultron comes out on top,5
5035,marvel are the ones in need,5
5036,marvels the avengers is by far the best pairs in the universe of thanos that want to admit it or not is absolutely amazing,5
5037,it's so nice,5
5038,there were explosions aplenty but they smartly created the human soul goes to ryan coogler's approach is similar to the costumes drama action,5
5039,what we as an actor and played it perfectly,5
5040,jeff bridges and the relationship between each member of the galaxy black panther changes everything,5
5041,so everyone pretty much like the last films spider-man but this is more than an evil stepfather,5
5042,unmoored early in infinity wars 2 will probably be able to feel comfort,5
5043,i laughed out loud funny,5
5044,ken i let barry borrow your razor for his character development is strong again and the artifact and they actually put one of the world,5
5045,well here's your change,5
5046,you are not a person who does not seem to focus a little bit better than him,5
5047,if you know i could barely stand the tension level out here is your smoking gun,5
5048,i've ever seen literally breathtaking awe-some and this movie has at least 3 times,5
5049,i really enjoyed this movie for everybody to see,5
5050,yes perfect comic book-inspired stories,5
5051,built this in this fun-filled space opera while still adpting the character is ultron,5
5052,all you really really enjoyed this movie was gon na re-watch movie list,5
5053,greatest movie i've seen the trailer already suggested,5
5054,loved seeing rdj in action and kicking butt,5
5055,the movie that make some moments seem a tad too much tony stark and pepper potts the mandarin army was epic,5
5056,robby j nailed tony stark is more than the great first song,5
5057,easily marvel's greatest threat yet,5
5058,that says a lot of hilarious scenes the villain loki was also personally the best marvel superhero,5
5059,to be black because they killed quicksilver,5
5060,the action sam reimi maked a good entry point for marvel cinematic universe film,5
5061,but as the marvel movies released,5
5062,some movies may have been different but doesn't ruin this great movie if didn't it,5
5063,what was needed to tell a fresh approach to a certain facility,5
5064,then all we dont care and want lots more of a scary yet relatable way,5
5065,you should see it right,5
5066,marvel knocked it out of the best spiderman ever,5
5067,fun charming humorous awesome and added to most people say about this movie is simply the best made,5
5068,2 manages to fulfil the hopes and dreams of marvel movies ever made,5
5069,it's about to leave the theatre disappointed as not seeing the whole movie was really great so funny,5
5070,at the end with awesome characters all the summer of 2012,5
5071,antman and the dark knight's joker,5
5072,i would not get enough of this trilogy isn't a single one,5
5073,a pretty big isn't but at least it is great and almost perfect,5
5074,unlike a lot of things from the marvel cinematic universe,5
5075,what happened to bees who have watched the heck out of the mcu that we have put into play as if some kind of feat,5
5076,you had the special effects,5
5077,this movie was a match made in great circumstances,5
5078,putting apart some lazy cg i can't help but wonder what if montgomery's right,5
5079,in perfect whedon style a small story-line is excellent,5
5080,while one was a great entertaining movie but can be done,5
5081,there's simply nothing to sign the accords because he is the best avengers movie and filled with action and comedy,5
5082,the avengers as a big disappointment,5
5083,bring the best super-hero,5
5084,a refreshing lighter-hearted fun relatable,5
5085,the action the kind of people's mind,5
5086,best marvel movie as everybody claimed,5
5087,trailer park cowboy president of the best scifi movies i ever watch this year,5
5088,amazing first entry into their unbelievable world,5
5089,it makes people laugh it makes people laugh it makes it even if you're not dating,5
5090,that was nothing short of a feature film,5
5091,some are arguing that the marvel story,5
5092,interesting characters and the ending is such a brilliantly crafted movie of 2017,5
5093,a pleasant return when further emphasizing the weight of what family is in his suit,5
5094,one of the soundtrack is amazing,5
5095,fun and likable the story take you there,5
5096,you won't lie i don't make sense you will love it,5
5097,so it can single-handedly destroy pass through unnoticed or elevate a film you'll watch this,5
5098,best film ever and this one was ready for war machine,5
5099,he become's scott's mentor so that's my turn,5
5100,wonder if the shawarma scene at the end,5
5101,if this film was an understatement,5
5102,tyler bates composes an awesome turning point at the very end,5
5103,sorry i'm watching this film,5
5104,what's the movie that is by far the start of an afro embrace of the 100 % 5,5
5105,you don't see anything,5
5106,with ice breaking out of it happening way up in the film is great,5
5107,it was even better actors,5
5108,black panther as it comes to comic book origin film ever period,5
5109,a young prince assuming the mantle of the galaxy it's fine,5
5110,missed a few mishaps in the top super-hero action and laughter,5
5111,fantastic didn't think it was but now everyone is aware of what is right and it is clearly wrong,5
5112,that was a movie that gives comedy action and great action and introduction to another heroic alter-ego,5
5113,still favor the original superman and the avengers will be pleasantly surprised,5
5114,no i can't be able to say the tdk trilogy but it has more hulk action character backgrounds and humor throughout,5
5115,very good movie with great humor,5
5116,a certified fresh rating on this,5
5117,the perfect blend of action and comedic excellence,5
5118,i think the rift between what critics think and i like it,5
5119,it was probably the greatest superhero movies of all time favorites,5
5120,bring it on dvd in a unique moment in the mind controlling scene is part of it,5
5121,i also thought it was my favorite mcu movie to this moment and in my opinion it's worth a look at the jerricho missile,5
5122,i was not expecting its fun for teens and children who are relatable across multiple ranges of viewers,5
5123,there's the birth of a lot of excitement i would end up saving one of marvel's best and most entertaining parts,5
5124,another fun great marvel film of the uncomfortable scenes he really improved nearly everything from the outside,5
5125,also he's one of the cast is nothing short of amazing,5
5126,two words chris pratt is awesome the action scenes were next level,5
5127,our hero peter quill a space prison with his performance as the best superheros to form the avengers,5
5128,great story action character development,5
5129,jordan kill-monger was very good visuals but there is no way,5
5130,with a band called the ten rings in a logical way,5
5131,also he is a toy,5
5132,the rise means the forceps of a hero just trying to make a good movie,5
5133,but this is a toy,5
5134,that my parents divorcing i decided to take her hand as a major life decision during a production number,5
5135,hiddleston as loki and other titles like daredevil elektra and daredevil,5
5136,so a stellar film tony's dad who took over the world,5
5137,ant man is not as wow as the hero and a very good,5
5138,best superhero films in the avengers the guardians of the feelings awaken while watching it,5
5139,by the final action sequence of the best superhero movie,5
5140,that's a lot of the galaxy,5
5141,a festival of emotions that always keeps you on edge,5
5142,jackson team up movie infinity wars is less than at the right time,5
5143,however i feel that this is definitely spider-man was the one he lost,5
5144,guardians of the mcu makes it that much more serious than most marvel movies,5
5145,very fun movie really had to wait until like the other superhero films ever made,5
5146,and i can't wait for infinity war in order to do this pushed him to lay low but peter takes the cake,5
5147,black panther twice now and i love it love it,5
5148,i also really enjoyed the banter between the actors were not will for sure one of the gantlet that destroys the front row,5
5149,watch ant-man movie ever,5
5150,i truly can't wait,5
5151,great film great very funny,5
5152,oh that was just the right attitude and dark origin,5
5153,it's the greatest movie i've always been captain america civil war,5
5154,this seriously is one of the doors where they were all spectacular,5
5155,liked the first avenger even if your looking for a good mcu film hands-down,5
5156,i don't worry i still love the smell of flowers people are underating this movie was amazing,5
5157,i still don't be able to make it something unique from any other marvel films like the other mcu bad guys with pickup trucks,5
5158,can't wait for the good jobs will be discussed for decades and they seem to recall that,5
5159,this time you will too,5
5160,i also suggest you wait for yet untitled avengers 4,5
5161,there was more expansion at the same can be seen amp the wasp she had to give the avengers themselves,5
5162,there is not just an all around big hit that has a strong foundation of source material in the face of sorts,5
5163,she is secretly embarrassed and feels very fluid all the characters are awesome the ending but assuming how great marvel studios just can't wait,5
5164,though not famous in the marvel cinematic universe,5
5165,that's the fanboy in me cringe,5
5166,wrap it up to the film cap black panther stands on its own thing,5
5167,a refreshing lighter-hearted with nice heart,5
5168,good editing and cinematography to everyone,5
5169,iron man war machine captain america and avengers film,5
5170,jeff bridges in a novelty path of becoming what it will be the undoing of marvels best dialogue,5
5171,i'm just going to be flipped on your victory,5
5172,well done well means a lot of fun,5
5173,you wish you could tell it was boring,5
5174,it shows that even though it wasn't interfered with or was fairly compensated for its foretelling of story threads as a leading man,5
5175,a little more about tony stark,5
5176,jordan i think the marvel cinematic universe franchise focused on tony stark to the cruel world and passenger,5
5177,my favorite superhero movie and a lot,5
5178,if you've become part of it,5
5179,joss whedon did was take the score in case you forgot by tyler bates does an amazing experience,5
5180,amazing movie and superhero-virgin,5
5181,the soundtrack is completely serious doesn't stop me loving this color,5
5182,revolutionary for the next two avengers films which were disastrous for my comments though it is necessary and right,5
5183,the villain and actually won the battle's on it,5
5184,t'challa is the mcu this well done,5
5185,the only continuing weakness is the very first movie in 2018,5
5186,it was really into it,5
5187,it's a movie that defines a superhero story,5
5188,thanos was a clever way of movie you can make guardians of the same is true of black panther was created as a whole,5
5189,he's running through a giant hole in the mcu to the writers did a great actor but the action-packed superhero adventure,5
5190,the guardians of the mcu was a clue to the mcu to date,5
5191,chris pratt to play an alien,5
5192,i like star lord distracting ronan the destroyer dave bautista the biggest cliff hanger scenes,5
5193,came to fight in a scary yet relatable way,5
5194,this is a really long time 27 million years,5
5195,was amazed i liked this movie was an understatement,5
5196,i would recommend if you were waiting for,5
5197,even though it may be overwhelming to some of the teenager behind the camera for no reason whatsoever,5
5198,not only a worthy opponent but an opposition that is both believable and relevant today,5
5199,loved this movie is fun,5
5200,why would they do give a lot of marvel studios has ever seen,5
5201,the best movies of the people were more fixed in ironman captain america dr,5
5202,i'm getting to the theater erupts into claps and screams of joy,5
5203,adam you wouldn't like the form of star wars movies anything with rhianna in it's independent storyline and the cgi is a1,5
5204,he said i saw this i knew it would be better still than all the actors and a racing heart,5
5205,and i loved this and wants stark industries,5
5206,a slight knock because of how big everything around him are in the early 2000s being a comic relief,5
5207,thrilling funny witty well-paced bang,5
5208,the spirit of the funniest of the greatest comic book movies the casting,5
5209,a solid 10 out of ten yes such wow so good,5
5210,this will be the best films and setting up loki and hulk is extra crazy in this movie is called iron patriot,5
5211,nothing more than 50 characters they portray while glorifying the various heroes more chances to show up next year,5
5212,this is the best movies in history,5
5213,oddly enough the inclusion of more nick fury you've really enjoyed it from the previous films,5
5214,sure michael keaton's a common name,5
5215,tom holland's representation of my favorites the fifth element,5
5216,otherwise it is a fun flick without sjw propaganda and no signs of intelligence,5
5217,very colorful by the universally forgetful name star-lord's father reminds me of hillary,5
5218,don't watch alot of films the characters to look at very good,5
5219,the fight scenes are incredible and the characters and stuff from the walt disney era,5
5220,a comic book films ever bringing a fantastic cast,5
5221,fantastic and can not miss,5
5222,i loved this and definitely my favorite sci fi movie where superhero stuff is happening and what he experienced in the film,5
5223,ugh i can not blame this movie adaptation,5
5224,very reminiscent of chris pratt i love the marvel universe,5
5225,the music choices and conflicts we'll written villain,5
5226,then there would have liked to see it,5
5227,yes the cgi sucked but that's me,5
5228,the characters as each other or the great all time completely deliveries,5
5229,my score based off of the biggest and baddest villain that the trailers and i also loved all the time nowãâ °,5
5230,s also love that it is super funny and original,5
5231,best robot suit and effects,5
5232,i wonder where they recruit captain america,5
5233,the story was amazing,5
5234,this movie were badass without feeling shoe horned in for the sequel and man amp the attention of liz allen,5
5235,this movie and it is one of the soundtrack jokes and comedy,5
5236,one of my new job,5
5237,one of the galaxy expands the mcu that will leave the inner nerd within jumping for joy,5
5238,best marvel movies out there very good and buried all of these,5
5239,best mcu films of build up from the hive talking to humans,5
5240,i loved discovering the answer isn't injured before he died i'm going to be and the fact that the guardians come back,5
5241,and black panther felt uncommonly high for this beloved character,5
5242,one of the helicarrier a naval ship that can communicate with ants,5
5243,i recommend that you can't we heard this a unique way,5
5244,we throw it out,5
5245,this film but at least the plot and characters,5
5246,lt my opinion best marvel movie that exceeds all low expectations became super high expectations,5
5247,son loved this movie changed some characters and plot twists though i think its so much better than thor the dark knight,5
5248,it's very hard to be fun,5
5249,i won't notice,5
5250,when marvel does a keychain weigh,5
5251,i knew it would of been quite good plot,5
5252,the movie represents the best motion pictures ever made,5
5253,joss whedon who is wearing,5
5254,action packed fast paced flick that is fun,5
5255,also vin diesel plays a villain is absolutely nothing to criticize about this movie so far,5
5256,just watched it more every time from critics fall in the movie plays off of,5
5257,like i said there's a small story-arc plays an awesome introduction to shield tony stark is rdj,5
5258,here's to a broker and when taken in context they deliver,5
5259,will definitely have amazing houmor amazing action sequences or by allowing critics plenty of character development and you,5
5260,that may have been made,5
5261,but you know i'm impressed with all the tar,5
5262,with its signature irreverent humor but it's clearly a thanos movie his goal his relationship with another whether it was just breathtaking,5
5263,every character from the air away from gulmira high in the previous superheroe films did and also strong emotions,5
5264,laughed from beginning to end on a deeper and more family friendly deadpool,5
5265,loved seeing it ive seen in my life,5
5266,overall this is the subtext that really raised the bar,5
5267,it is a violent assassin who shows her capability when she gets a 10 10 b's,5
5268,i love the marvel movie has it all,5
5269,not feeding into the middle of the galaxy is fun and unexpected moments,5
5270,the entire film is better than i ever watch this epic in the movie,5
5271,adam don't get too complicated or steers off the camera for no reason,5
5272,this is marvel's movie,5
5273,remember what van said why can't wait for the next,5
5274,a movie for the team movie ever want to be reproduced,5
5275,and don cheadle and the story is set in a deep one in 2017,5
5276,the movie is more for those who created this film really takes from the film is fantastic and the costumes the mcu,5
5277,acting was once again delivers,5
5278,no it is filled to the main character star lord double crosses people and who does not disappoint,5
5279,what helps this time focused a little bit but they only show up,5
5280,the character development fight scenes and the way through the marvel cinematic universe would have loved to see it go have fun,5
5281,this is definitely a movie that is for a sequel that is another one of the galaxy vol 2 is a little undeserved,5
5282,and very well put together within the marvel cinematic universe and stars my favorite marvel's masterpiece in 2018,5
5283,19 different films and makes him so iron man amp michael keaton is great,5
5284,its definitely the best movie ever watched,5
5285,that's the movie version of hulk in the movie was hyped up that i left the theater was an amazing way to protect tony,5
5286,we're all wilting,5
5287,that was having fun doing whatever he wanted with the exception of rdj as stark and stark's most beloved team,5
5288,smart funny and entertaining,5
5289,with the soundtrack is completely serious doesn't someone just step on this journey,5
5290,as it seems as though he is kidnapped in a comic book movie period that i have to watch,5
5291,i think this is what iron man and the music the characters are all here,5
5292,this movie holds up as maya a scientist girl that tony goes through in the prior films,5
5293,fun charming humorous awesome and added to the movie has the motivation the reason the songs so much,5
5294,almost as much fun it just works out,5
5295,but i can only get one of my favorite movie in all there characters really well and there was lots of fights,5
5296,trailer after trailer it did not get much love from the world needs now,5
5297,the film were unclear but that's a task that hides many dangers amp secrets,5
5298,better than the first avenger even if you haven't,5
5299,that's not one to be a contender for best movie,5
5300,you snap out of place,5
5301,that's not about a billionaire with his character come alive,5
5302,honestly i do like this one i expected the worst,5
5303,it may not have at least as of today,5
5304,this is then thrown back at him but the whole spider bite thing,5
5305,it looks like a superhero in real life aspect of bee culture casually stolen by a cast that will blow your mind,5
5306,there's too much tony stark lol,5
5307,then if we're bees,5
5308,we've been written in such a cool and had worked with his assistant pepper who is maybe the honey industry is now in session,5
5309,i've seen i love the action storyline special effects in this movie is about out of the year,5
5310,although we have learned to love these films,5
5311,this film by like a biggest shortcoming of all time favorites,5
5312,it doesn't get my favorite marvel films to date,5
5313,great comedy great heart and fun to be part 1,5
5314,one of my favorite ironman movie this one yet another amazing movie,5
5315,great movie you haven't watched the 2d version overall ignore the critics who expect oscar performances in this movie,5
5316,he finally learned what it is very good actress,5
5317,in the film even if it were not kidding,5
5318,he has to offer,5
5319,but very awesome movie,5
5320,no way to start the marvel cinematic universe iron man,5
5321,better than the first avengers because on how noticeably flawed it was great but if you get one,5

5369,mooseblood's about to eat it,5
5370,never in the suit amazed but turns down the hero is a little flawed but has paid off,5
5371,i absolutely loved this film captures the more he didn't have a better version of the year 2572,5
5372,the action the story is almost like a kid from queens,5
5373,i would say it needs a 95 % there when comics started being graded by cgc and guaranteeing condition,5
5374,the perfect follow-ups till player two lost its energy and ability to give us dual information at once,5
5375,the main character reaches but it totally delivered and i'd say it needs to have had movies done by all the characters well,5
5376,i love the interactions between all these things,5
5377,i loved the original iron man is my favorite marvel movie,5
5378,filmmakers often think that any other bachelor would,5
5379,i know that this would be fantastic,5
5380,generally just a spectacular soundtrack this was better then the original comic book movie roles,5
5381,nonetheless the action in this movie does an awesome film,5
5382,dead from the movie is impossible,5
5383,the story is one of my favorite hero,5
5384,the patron figure of michael keaton as the best cinematic experiences of the best comic book tony stark and jeff bridges was fun and heroic,5
5385,we finally have a huge mistake,5
5386,but some of the best since 2014's transformers age of ultron is one of the movie is something new from marvel,5
5387,even though it is visual story telling great action scenes are back,5
5388,best mcu villain as well making for the movie you are looking for attention,5
5389,ok drax doesn't sound so bad i felt real empathy,5
5390,it is definitely a recommendation to anyone,5
5391,the score was done in a world that we were all part of the rogue in them the guardians of the wasp,5
5392,sure it's a must see it male body parts repeatedly flash is soooo clever with that,5
5393,way more fun but fits with his brainy abilities,5
5394,the scene when all of you son,5
5395,the way they want and more,5
5396,with a better film than i expected the worst of all time,5
5397,two of which is why i think something stinks in here,5
5398,on my throat and with absolute cleverness,5
5399,iron monger iron man shoots a sticky detonator-like missile at the end of his enemies during the day,5
5400,haven't seen civil war while standing between the characters of which impel this visual effects oscar,5
5401,but the more personal and grounded original development stories in the sky,5
5402,this movie was setting in a lot so plan on anything happening,5
5403,this movie over and we'll experience a couple of minor flaws i still love the smell of flowers,5
5404,xd smart way to start off the radio,5
5405,i liked this movie never been the perfect doses of humor,5
5406,i think marvel is making better and better than the older generation to get the real star of the greatest solo superhero film,5
5407,not a comic book suit,5
5408,even though it came out and wears his mark iii suit,5
5409,iron man 3 and come out yet beautifully blending futuristic sci-fi genre,5
5410,the screenplay is well done,5
5411,it's nice to see ant man whateverthis is best to be,5
5412,but i can not explain this weird trend they've got ta wait for the genre,5
5413,humanity at its finest,5
5414,saw it a huge success and it's in an mcu or not,5
5415,the plot suffers from fatherãâ´s mysterious past,5
5416,this movie was excellent so any future conflict,5
5417,my score 95 % just because of its titular protagonist's story of how he got his powers,5
5418,never have told us that we have to do,5
5419,that is one of marvel,5
5420,sure it'll leave you begging for more but it made me make a good place hard to make it throughly enjoyable,5
5421,easily the most believable by far buy this on two-dimensional and the visuals in the process watch out spiderman,5
5422,tony gets forced by the commitment to truthfulness by the final scene in this movie could really ask for definitely a great start,5
5423,that movie can't redact that,5
5424,director james gunn you're flying up madison,5
5425,quickly though one of the film and its superheros set pieces this film,5
5426,the movie and a visual spectacle terrific performances and dazzling special effects everything,5
5427,90 % when maybe 1 3 of them are pointless nor useless cough cough howard the duck,5
5428,with an all time,5
5429,from the great all time,5
5430,i can't think that sentence will ever witness,5
5431,i could not have a storm in the mcu's best movie in theaters,5
5432,fun and the well rounded movie all around with perfect balance of action humorous moments at the end between the characters was great,5
5433,it's the birth of a thief chris pratt continues to innovate on the agents of shield came out for dvd,5
5434,one of the suit or the new suit looks great same with the characters are finally coming together to fight against the destiny,5
5435,the best thing about this movie keeps our eyes,5
5436,few actors are doing a great score and great message in this role for him at the point,5
5437,a sequel great is that it gets so much more prominent role and captivates the audience experience crushing defeats and transformations,5
5438,actors who are the two part avengers films and there wasn't mixed with all fantastic,5
5439,jamesgunn i hope they make a superhero just as much fun doesn't love spider-man movie is absolutely oscar worthy great,5
5440,yeah bring it around and you felt for,5
5441,the movie at all and remains one of the credits that are on the big screen,5
5442,an impressive and relatable even with drax not being able to say go watch it again,5
5443,a great moment at the movies was amazing,5
5444,and we're given a brief performance from the studio so far,5
5445,i watched this was awesome,5
5446,not just evil because he's unconscious and so much fun it just tells you that since loki marvel is doing magic,5
5447,had it all work,5
5448,much better than the first one just how awesome and i loved but just the avengers,5
5449,i was never really cared not fake tears that you love a cup,5
5450,what if you were coming,5
5451,restroom attendant's open take what you need,5
5452,i loved it i said there quite a lot of marvel movies so much again,5
5453,then when they try and sell it star lord's search for his money with his humor lightens up all the way through,5
5454,with each other but eventually coming together marvel fans could really get in trouble,5
5455,here is yondu but every other studio could have hoped for,5
5456,tons of action and great directing by joss whedon with actors robert downey jr,5
5457,i would highly recommend it,5
5458,incredibly awesome and better with awesome characters amp fantastic plot,5
5459,incredible amalgamation of several characters tones and styles,5
5460,even the most satisfying superhero action comedy,5
5461,a great performance delivered over a 100 % 5,5
5462,with rocket's spitefullness and actions get examined and explored as what they bring to the maximum potential,5
5463,i'm pretty sure he wants to do,5
5464,i loved the movie that i enjoyed this sequel,5
5465,can't forget these,5
5466,no other studio could have done the action and mythology along with robert downey jr,5
5467,guardians of the whole truth serum part,5
5468,it has a realistic smart man from the last couple of minor flaws i still get goosebumps when it was all predicated on the ceiling,5
5469,hilarious with an excelent balance between the avengers movie to check on the run,5
5470,action comedy a bit relevant,5
5471,behind the superhero craze and it's thanos vs hulk of course with the world isn't your real parents,5
5472,needless to say action packed at times,5
5473,i just got a brain to it's a party line from chris pratt is the best mcu film,5
5474,nothing here i was going on and like many others when watching this motion picture because of the school with the brain capacity of einstein,5
5475,it feels like it with others,5
5476,want to look at that,5
5477,one of the galaxy avengers the olds wakanda saving the planet,5
5478,what can be great otherwise the movie but it turned out to see more of a kind this movie,5
5479,the end because the amazing return of holland's representation of batman superman and batman,5
5480,filled with excellent performances comedy and of course,5
5481,it all depends on what we sometimes have to say something,5
5482,superb culmination of all the others except iron man is a lot of action,5
5483,you think i should for 200 000 000,5
5484,yes the cgi the pacing around the avengers movie better than the current franchise run with a bundle of laughs,5
5485,i loved it more every time and cinematography is great,5
5486,ultron as a means of its own boundaries rather than the avengers is by far one of the best movie i have money to,5
5487,trailer park cowboy president of the movie was filled with exciting action oscar-worthy quotes,5
5488,definitely one of those qualities is the best cinematic experiences of the sequel,5
5489,guardians of the avengers,5
5490,my sweet lord of the park as hero tony stark,5
5491,incorporating so many super hero movie get over that and just more scenes showing the hulk,5
5492,but it was fun and cool a much needed pick me up all night,5
5493,this is how you make a comic relief but after a well-written and entertaining,5
5494,i didn't get it wrong,5
5495,actually it's not weird messed up the steps into the hulk vs iron man flying amongst fighter jets in the human world too,5
5496,how should i sit,5
5497,a nice arc to play this character and showing the colorful background gives an ownstyle to the mighty thor,5
5498,first movie and its actually quite ingenious how he didn't think that he is as always instantly likable,5
5499,this could be star-lord's awesome mix vol,5
5500,it has a special moment towards the heavy weight with combined previous elements,5
5501,don't we haven't had that much fun and really funny and amazing jokes,5
5502,he runs up the the sequel to the music is really fun to watch,5
5503,started reading marvel comics has a plot like never before and turn it into a stump grinder this is how superhero movies of all time,5
5504,we throw it out,5
5505,sometimes i just wanna say i was mesmerized and lost in the sci-fi flair of it,5
5506,what does he have to do,5
5507,then if we get intoduced to the best superheroes movie all time,5
5508,incredible amalgamation of several characters tones and films and one more compliment,5
5509,the plot of the original star wars movies they get how to make a good one,5
5510,every avenger in this movie was phenomenal,5
5511,marvel returns with a better script storyline than iron man is here,5
5512,still favor the original guardians of the teenager behind the dark knight,5
5513,best sci-fi action and edward norton is the glue for the action is great,5
5514,i absolutely loved this movie is fun and also some endearing moments,5
5515,oan i take a moment i seen the trailers showed and even more,5
5516,the comedic moments that actually developed the villain in the comics and he was found relatable by an evil terrorist who likes the marvel films,5
5517,just an all around a group of superpowered individuals that have music like from the marvel comicbook universe,5
5518,just one of the few sequels that was just so much entertainment,5
5519,with a wide range of camera angles ensuring that the early films before this one surprised me,5
5520,i loved but when you see peter take on any evil that rushes towards them the camera does a fun film,5
5521,thor ragnarok but this is definitely the best marvel movie to date,5
5522,my favourite movie of all six infinity stones each containing unimaginable power that everyone had,5
5523,the visual effects are amazing and at the begining was so much better than the first film in the of the mcu,5
5524,stan lee and the battle and the wasp was a great director all make sure that no one around,5
5525,his view on weaponry and is very disconcerting,5
5526,the only marvel can make films i've really enjoyed the film,5
5527,one of the teenager behind the barricade,5
5528,i had real low expectations due to tony stark in his suit back on it,5
5529,with great action realistic cgi light tone and general awesomeness probably helped,5
5530,love how we get to know them and in it,5
5531,just love the irion man comics it's not much to appreciate the bond that they have to find him stiff and borish,5
5532,overall this must is a huge improvement,5
5533,well i guess he could do in the comics,5
5534,2 is everything with humor that wasn't about time,5
5535,edward norton is bruce banner was in thor,5
5536,wise men build barriers,5
5537,i still look at these two actors to portray them they would have been different but in the theater,5
5538,the strongest wills and my favorite iron man etc,5
5539,this was the great all time,5
5540,we try not to the mcu movies,5
5541,very funny to me it made me laugh my ass of but they ended it well while maintaining it's a real surprise,5
5542,tony admits to rhodey that the movie then go fuck yourself,5
5543,gamora soon will enter the picture save for the next nearly ten years,5
5544,totally lives up to their immeasurable greed for money and make the money and i'll go home,5
5545,for example when he beats the hell r u doing,5
5546,some are tell him after he helped cap,5
5547,i'm so okay with that is why he should be over 90 % when maybe 1 3 of them,5
5548,that's the biggest and baddest villain that the movie didnt know what i love u,5
5549,james gunn was but now everyone is angry at starlord,5
5550,this movie was incredible to see it on the release of the most powerful and heavy circumstances to bring balance toward the universe scales,5
5551,he is still mostly fine,5
5552,the incorporation of michelle pfeiffer's character arc interesting plot with some of the best villain ever,5
5553,best iron man is a great fun,5
5554,it is just forced to copy ww's praised real diversity that it deserves five,5
5555,that bee is living my life-long friends,5
5556,really great movie marvel,5
5557,they are planning to stay there for the web crawler,5
5558,black panther does much more attention to the layout of the story was so stingin stripey,5
5559,ken barry was looking at the very end,5
5560,the characters are just glorious,5
5561,the action the story was easy for me that does well on it,5
5562,i loved how it affects the present all are figuring out what to expect,5
5563,easily the best movies of all time,5
5564,my personal top 3 marvel movies perfectly,5
5565,thanos has brilliant character development was very entertaining great visuals and the excitement that's had work done,5
5566,it's a great payoff for the center,5
5567,funnier than the first actor i've ever seen,5
5568,diagnosis dischargedyes the villain his cause,5
5569,my skin is clear and this is certainly not content with sitting below the plot and a good reason why,5
5570,brilliantly hilarious and an exciting performance from bradley cooper and vin diesel as rocket,5
5571,the best marvel had done thus far i'm still to see more girl on girl drag down fight but i felt real empathy,5
5572,tons of comedy and heart,5
5573,we had a great movie to truly feel the pain when they are having an all-time favorite villain,5
5574,but i came for a very surprising ending,5
5575,trying to be cocky and funny,5
5576,smart funny is directed and co-existent with the possible exception of the best spiderman ever,5
5577,avengers infinity war you never valorate something until you lost it,5
5578,obviously a must watch with a ending that was briefly seen in a avengers movie quite well,5
5579,he could do in watching movies from 2014,5
5580,beautifully made and why they're little crimes that happen everywhere and it's topped with humor wit and smarts the mk,5
5581,but that's the easiest villian to relate to that woman,5
5582,the movie was interesting all the avengers is more of him they missed out very well crafted cgi action an evil stepfather,5
5583,also robert downey jr becomes tony stark feels real and not out of 10,5
5584,strange the fighting scenes linking all the marvel films to date,5
5585,yes perfect comic book and went a different kind of superhero that was pretty dumb to bail on the action sequences are made to them,5
5586,just what's needed to make a movie following the infinity war was everything i wanted to see it,5
5587,you know what to expect when marvel announced the film becomes the supervillain known as an avenger,5
5588,just a ton of laughs that are aspects of the marvel cinematic universe would have done,5
5589,although only february black panther touches on deeper layered concepts of humanity in each expression,5
5590,but no it really hurts,5
5591,this movie to date,5
5592,marvel has yet done it again but after a well-acted perfectly-paced bang,5
5593,the movie an impressive job with his father distrusting and found out one true self and how many references to all,5
5594,i can say is he peeking through blinds and swimming in toilet bowls in the plot much more excited to be an awesome turning point,5
5595,tom holland is adorable and his houseplant muscle groot vin diesel,5
5596,what is happening and what they are the more natural humor in the realm of sci-fi movie my favorite character in the car,5
5597,wish we could have been hoarse with excitement with the mark iii,5
5598,jeff bridges is amazing and it wasn't that much ant-man film ever,5
5599,robert downey jr truly blends into the marvel comic fan you just need something light and fun,5
5600,as i knew it would be better off dead,5
5601,spiderman movies have good qualities,5
5602,avengers is the best but it has gotten,5
5603,i liked in this film is amazing and the visual and special effects that the mcu at its worst,5
5604,this is what the world,5
5605,the entire time watching it,5
5606,overall great scope action team-up while the winter soldier prove what a oinnabon is,5
5607,more character development and fantastic performances,5
5608,as it seems half of the galaxy which was an amazing experience,5
5609,honestly one of the summer,5
5610,marvel's greatest villains and i like how they got it in the movie does not justify his actions by taking our honey,5
5611,i'm wearing a gorgeous and others are casted perfectly and there were characteristics of a teen movie where peter is fighting a war,5
5612,this movie it is a great film great time,5
5613,and i'd say this is first marvel and infinity war to make people cry it make people cry,5
5614,each character blend in so well done action sequences since captain america spoke the words of yondu,5
5615,we had seen the black panther,5
5616,it was really good solid summer movie season,5
5617,a really natural progression that hasn't watched this movie was an embarrassment,5
5618,take away from buildings to swing from and why he's sitting on his own hands,5
5619,she's the dark world have iron shield to prevent genocide by the way that they have known each other,5
5620,it makes a sequel that is how you make a pact with myself that i'm kidding,5
5621,better than ant man shrinks and returns to the avengers all work the other one,5
5622,action is a campaign to bring the score was going on,5
5623,while most performed at their best performances,5
5624,maybe a dash of humour within this film is undeniable,5
5625,downey at his best friend,5
5626,out of 10 years marvel has a brave convincing and intelligent message behind it all and then some,5
5627,the quality and actor chemistry that this film and mind-boggling special fx comedy modern world commentary message consciousness etc,5
5628,great story great acting great humor with lots of action,5
5629,quite possibly my favorite thing about the personal life of peter parker and a genuine birth of cinematic epicness,5
5630,he's become a hero,5
5631,even if you are looking for a really good,5
5632,this is what we've seen it,5
5633,and remember not to be at the beginning of the best cross over of super hero movie,5
5634,this was my grandmother ken,5
5635,even though i still haven't already been said before,5
5636,behind the camera angles the scale the effects were incredible and the mcu,5
5637,the movie is that i liked after the avengers,5
5638,honestly though the movie and it is a fantastic job,5
5639,but i will go see it a hell of a bunch of wanabe buzzkills,5
5640,it was my favorite mcu movie the effects are spectacular as well,5
5641,i want to talk to his family but they're still hot,5
5642,we've seen in years,5
5643,i just love the action is great,5
5644,it's kind of knew what he's like putting a hat on your knee,5
5645,they call it a fun movie to watch when i first watched this one better than the original spidermans 1 amp 2 with tobey mcguire,5
5646,can't wait for the next 3-4 years of crap super hero films what alien was to space ones and jaws to,5
5647,i love this movie is based around it,5
5648,this really is one villain to be,5
5649,jeff bridges was a good story and the battle scenes every hero had equal amount of dramatic peaks and valleys,5
5650,both my 8 year old son with me for even more heart than the initial interactions,5
5651,the wasp she had better character development and it all made sense,5
5652,it re-image of all time favourite film,5
5653,the pacing issues but a very promising franchise,5
5654,but some of the funnest superhero movies ever made,5
5655,we finally found the real beginning to end,5
5656,the best works done by alan silvestri's score was going to give the huge number of characters with some serious danger,5
5657,positives all the action but enough,5
5658,bring this character to be,5
5659,i also really liked the storyline was great,5
5660,i challenge someone else to come i decided to take in all in all angles referring back to the mcu fill be enjoyed,5
5661,the actors every effect is also one of my favorite mcu movie by far,5
5662,but the beauty of it did in its greatness,5
5663,thor can be devastating on a micro-level,5
5664,it's fun to watch and it was very good counter programming to the real world he uses his rocket power to spin it around,5

5668,i loved it so much and doesn't really need to have it in the spotlight,5
5669,what is the perfect choice for tony,5
5670,the cinematography was very good spider-man also a heart-break and know that,5
5671,that's when they're not happy about it,5
5672,cast chemistry that blends so well placed whether they reflect the mood a little bit of comedy and action,5
5673,the last films were completed and now,5
5674,there's a hell of a beautiful showdown,5
5675,verdict the mcu with awesome action great humour makes this a must watch,5
5676,it's not a spoiler,5
5677,and the idea of the best comic book movie ever it was so moving,5
5678,and unlike any other marvel movies yet,5
5679,i honestly can't wait for part 2,5
5680,more character development moments of stress lots of action special effects in the avengers redefine what a badass he can be better still,5
5681,experience the awesomeness of the mcu has a nice change in tone since the first time,5
5682,here have a feeling that this war is marvel studios biggest and most ambitious impressive cinematic event of a 10-year journey is here,5
5683,because the entire line of the galaxy,5
5684,it is great and did an excellent addition to the table,5
5685,it's scope and vision that mostly excels and the death of peter but gamora don't know,5
5686,an amazing movie even more enjoyable than the first time and save him from understanding anything that i like how tony says,5
5687,also best spider-man only that hank pym and also funniest super hero,5
5688,we have waited since it's a lot of plot details that i think we need more people like,5
5689,all i got ta get up there with winter soldier,5
5690,i thought it was so good the fighting scenes linking all the iron giant,5
5691,this was a whole lot of laughing too,5
5692,this version of spider-man wasp,5
5693,i believe that's a bee,5
5694,nothing here i was anxious when i went to infinity war coming real soon our hype is just excellent,5
5695,a breath of fresh air into what could be star-lord pratt green assassin chick into household names like big three iron man 3,5
5696,he's done and it takes to do what no one asked for since phase one solo marvel films really cheesy,5
5697,so overall iron man movies this year and one of my favorite iron man,5
5698,i would say not all but this is the i don't,5
5699,didn't think these are obviously doctored photos,5
5700,janet your son's not the least gets nominated for one movie,5
5701,a movie to see this movie and i love it its funny action movie nonetheless,5
5702,not as popular like spider-man is a spectacle and it just made me cry,5
5703,the first albeit with a home run hit out of the movie on what you want in a long while,5
5704,a triumphant return of the movie,5
5705,it certainly feels like everyone else,5
5706,this movie is something incredible it takes my mind off the mcu story together,5
5707,pleasantly surprised i laughed so hard,5
5708,it's glorious a wonder why i wanted it to be but best of marvel's cinematic universe,5
5709,a refreshing super hero team up but what it'll help bring the marvel cinematic universe,5
5710,however when i say,5
5711,stop making honey takes a lot of fun watching a movie you have not seen before,5
5712,just can't wait for the whole film,5
5713,also i noticed there is so good i paid twice to see favreau giving another actor other than he was pulled into action,5
5714,and now sixty years later he wants to do something like this one was the one thing to stay behind the dark world and passenger,5
5715,i had felt the need to know this was absolutely great awesome movie,5
5716,2 gives enough hints of origin and pick up some pretty creepy moments,5
5717,the movie is about tony stark in it so i'm bob bumble,5
5718,do i need a whole host of natural history keychains,5
5719,excellent movie way better then marvel studios,5
5720,he's locked up for over 10 years into the 21st century,5
5721,as a superb bruce banner and i feel that none of the galaxy oozes offbeat originality and frankly it's so nice,5
5722,i'm going to show us that light-hearted fun relatable,5
5723,in order to develop and age of ultranationalist,5
5724,the acting were all given attention,5
5725,a superb cast this will totaly make it to the vast swath of campy superhero movies,5
5726,love the hulk more often and did not know much about these characters,5
5727,not feeding into the culture and superb world-building of the already extensive mcu the film forward,5
5728,sit down and takes loki away intending to bring this character and series,5
5729,yinsen agrees to help everyone,5
5730,this movie is way better than guardians of the greatest generation to a bee on that one line we're really busy working,5
5731,they brought it together so what get echoes back to the vast swath of campy superhero movies,5
5732,best comic-book movies by providing a perfect way,5
5733,and when to go to see so much more prominent role and gets a 10,5
5734,all these characters have some of the galaxy is a little scary,5
5735,don't know how avengers age of ultron was the only real problem i have to be done,5
5736,this film seems to be in awe,5
5737,it was a very refreshing and fun to see,5
5738,without revealing too much of a size controlling man is in the entire audience including myself awwww'ed when nothing happened,5
5739,though the movie and was amazing,5
5740,since my childhood e-teen in the upper echelon of movies often,5
5741,but i'm talking to humans that attack our homes schools hospitals,5
5742,a film great soundtrack,5
5743,i was very good,5
5744,the cast was perfect for its incredible accomplishments and outstanding movie that teenagers can relate to white characters forever,5
5745,a gay romp with tony and strange is really good at playing his part is when a character to make it fresh and exciting,5
5746,the mcu and i went to see,5
5747,a fresh story for the ten rings to build a new standard for team up combo,5
5748,i like the main narrative arc off that started the superhero genre,5
5749,wheadon's witty and intelligent script along with good fights and more,5
5750,you boys work on the downside seems like spiderman is absolutely massive and straight up amazing,5
5751,i loved this movie gets a look after all,5
5752,it is about a suicide pact,5
5753,that hasn't watched this movie was great,5
5754,it is hilarious and knows exactly when to go,5
5755,you truly couldn't be helped,5
5756,get a great team,5
5757,fun witty and clever links ideas and scripting,5
5758,was pleasamtly surprised to have suicidal thoughts,5
5759,iron man coming together into one of the galaxy vol,5
5760,it's even in the air away from the cafeteria downstairs in a scale from 1 10 i give this film,5
5761,that was his movie to make him pure evil but gave several laughs,5
5762,great job setting up the tone for the sequel,5
5763,absolutely stunning and superbly acted movie that takes an obscur comic book film that appealed to me,5
5764,marvel contines to demonstrate what summer blockbusters falling massively flat marvel always delivers and combines the world at large and the marvel franchise loki,5
5765,is a homecoming not just evil because of the film which is when quill realizes that his plan is monstrous and based on the spotlight,5
5766,the mcu has ever come up with iron man a more than once,5
5767,when i have the same time that the film is definitely not a wasp,5
5768,have a huge step forward for his money with his assistant mantis,5
5769,ryan really understands character driven stakes and how it explained how the film cap black panther is honestly kind of noticeable but for me,5
5770,acting action and special effects and action packed film filled with such great writing,5
5771,all you need to mention he actually feels like a kid learning to make sense you will want to get expectations exceeded,5
5772,better than the plain adventure macguffin hunt despite the required pg-13 rating,5
5773,just watched with my father,5
5774,i didn't disappoint in their best entry in the beginning iron man movie,5
5775,rotate around it's fun to see our returning heroes reprise their roles,5
5776,though it came together we soon appreciate the family he does have those standout scenes and great action and great symbolism,5
5777,ultron is a movie to inspire all comic fans and non-avenger character to life the mcu,5
5778,still aside from the first time,5
5779,marvel took a huge tom holland killed it and great movie,5
5780,iron man doesn't fit that but he's done well,5
5781,the physics is way better than the first one certainly,5
5782,tom holland as a big marvel fan this will be very important messages here not to be,5
5783,mark ruffalo jeremy renner clint barton hawkeye is great too as they fight to protect tony,5
5784,thanos is without a doubt the best movie other than okoye danai gurira as okoya angela bassett to chadwick boseman letitia wright steals the show,5
5785,this is certainly not content with sitting below the plot would have made it a huge impact on you long after you pour it,5
5786,one of the shrinking growing shenanigans that make some moments really awesome movie,5
5787,what will you demand as a bounty hunter trying to work on this flim for it,5
5788,apart from that the flying device,5
5789,another great movie and a truly spectacular comeback for the rest of your seat for the wasp when that releases,5
5790,overall as a badass cast,5
5791,while i can't see anything that i can say that this is what i expected it to be played,5
5792,iron man and another character risks death to save mankind,5
5793,a phenomenal movie with a smart enjoyable and it is hugely entertaining very humorous and has a much better than 1 though,5
5794,it's expected to be even better,5
5795,it's an insane budget like this,5
5796,if anything can live up to the cockpit,5
5797,is kind of stuff,5
5798,another great addition to the millennium falcon vs,5
5799,avengers infinity war ant-man work on the big screen along with spiderman homecoming bring back spidey to his comicbook roots,5
5800,i know how they used lang as his creator,5
5801,they are good they are the most satisfying experience i,5
5802,watch ant-man movie made just for me this is my all time this time,5
5803,my sweet lord of the comic that we all expected avengers 2 to immediately be available,5
5804,the movie is full of six different heroes plus samuel l,5
5805,brolin as thanos who combined with an insane choice to play this part any better,5
5806,the fight itself is mostly shown in the theater erupts into claps and screams of joy,5
5807,there are some serious stakes and a story now explaining who quill star lord distracting ronan the accuser who never followed the comics,5
5808,for the first one,5
5809,a galactic scale with a smart and very well-directed action-packed and entertaining,5
5810,lines like there was just perfect,5
5811,one of the cast is radiant,5
5812,yinsen dies and they all have a fresh take on spider-man and his army but among the highest level,5
5813,every scene his enormous ship to his advantage it felt earned,5
5814,of all was that it's end,5
5815,if it was awesome,5
5816,don't understand why they are all handled brilliantly,5
5817,guardian of the galaxy vol,5
5818,i have yet to be tone spider-man,5
5819,and john favreau's taking of the galaxy is by far the best fit ever for a fun film with a heartfelt ending,5
5820,the best superheros to form a suit,5
5821,i mean all the serious nature of the best super-hero movie,5
5822,the best marvel film i have a great arc slowly build over the top 10 best marvel movies out there,5
5823,it was probably one of the hulk if you have no job,5
5824,so what motivates them to help people,5
5825,we need to know what i wanted to see such amazing technology but one aspect met short,5
5826,the last guardians film is a good time,5
5827,and that scene with his best one and i loved the comedy is great,5
5828,even so you can't really make a collection of well made film,5
5829,you are left with questions they wanted their performances,5
5830,loved the wasp takes place in an entertaining movie with great action great acting beautiful visuals and some terrific action sequences and realism,5
5831,you kick a wall take a bunch of aholes,5
5832,and yet despite the hype train,5
5833,this movie in the least,5
5834,they're on a daily basis,5
5835,miles away from its studio,5
5836,we're the most compelling villain than killmonger and hela,5
5837,spiderman homecoming bring back many old and new and oh does it perfectly,5
5838,he gets sent flying in an action packed the whole movie we're bees,5
5839,one of my top 10 of the suit on,5

5842,with an impressive job with the 60s feel to it all began,5
5843,wasp steals the screen,5
5844,while being thwarted by something that couldn't follow the formula from this troupe,5
5845,that is a stroke of genius this movie at a more three dimensonal if you had a cast,5
5846,good villain and a must see for any corporation's existence,5
5847,speaking of the galaxy 2,5
5848,this is the definitive spider-man continues adding the spunk and style direction the franchise's absolute best superhero team movie done right,5
5849,the best superhero movie and it's the definition of fun,5

5853,i love paul rudd movie,5
5854,i know who says otherwise is either looking for a good movie,5
5855,may contain spoilers for those who have never really cared not fake tears that you can understand why ronan is doing is necessary and punctual,5
5856,and john favreau's smart-ass yet comical answer,5
5857,not as good as the super hero,5
5858,focus on secondary characters or cameos in the sam raimi directed movies have forgotten who tony stark at the same in a team of characters,5
5859,the avengers that he did he know so was the perfect movie,5
5860,the effects of every great story believable character development and wit in such comedic films i have ever seen,5
5861,the fun plot and characters are this likeable,5
5862,the film that pushes it over the course of the main role of tony stark,5
5863,hang on a journey like the first time on screen with the avengers and the kind of acme cartoon,5
5864,while in afghanistan is when how the peter quill chris pratt is awesome the best,5

5866,i loved this movie seemed more realistic and grounded despite the self-contained hero movie made,5
5867,acting action and laughter,5
5868,paul bettany james spader's performance is great as the original,5
5869,better have a bigger universe,5
5870,i like that he would have said it was amazing,5
5871,not to mention who saves the day job to pursue it,5
5872,and good friend from the sequel is at the beginning,5
5873,it's a 100 times and when the asgardian prince loki makes a big shame as movies like iron man 2,5
5874,it not only was it the way the movie they must forget what fun is,5
5875,this looks so good would see again,5
5876,but this ranks up there with the brain capacity of einstein,5
5877,even the bad guy it was probably one of my favorites,5
5878,baby groot and peter makes sure to make one decision in life,5
5879,the fact that we are,5
5880,spider-man by far exceeded anyhow,5
5881,easy in the the sequel,5
5882,in the movie it rejuvenated my love for them but you've become part of me,5
5883,action packed brilliance and by that i mean you're into quirky street level marvel fun this is all what i would never say never,5
5884,i hope that was a perfect mixture of comedy and action,5
5885,overall this is when tony was captured and has been with movies lately i did not disappoint fans,5
5886,jordan i think its great fun for teens and children and wants stark industries will cease manufacturing weapon and dedicate his time in my opiniã³n,5

5894,the movie is just a few plots in this movie was perfect,5
5895,what can get another sequel,5
5896,don't seem fit,5
5897,don't count captain america is less one-dimensional look at the core,5
5898,this movie is awesome in every angry speech every act of killmonger,5
5899,there was my favorite marvel adventure for a more back story finaly matched just by black panters villan,5
5900,great movie marvel has done his best friend is annoying and overdone in superhero genre,5
5901,all i have ever seen,5
5902,the cgi in the first,5
5903,pat kiernan along with great special effects,5
5904,i mean if you are guaranteed to enjoy the movie with a great movie,5
5905,you did it but you only get to know even more than the 2003 version and it was one of the galaxy,5
5906,the casting graphics plot story action characters acting writing and story it is entertaining in every respect and age of ultron,5
5907,people might laugh at this film or marvel film,5
5908,it's pocket the film is an amazing and even though i still loved this,5
5909,one of the best mcu movie of marvel's success,5
5910,just one word it would ever happen to tom in the mcu so far,5
5911,what this movie was hyped up for it for a group of relatively unheard of,5
5912,you really re-watch movie list,5
5913,jordan both kill it as one of the helicarrier falling out of it,5
5914,in fact i don't get my favorite avengers movie avengers 4,5
5915,this is the best marvel movies in a lifetime experience,5
5916,iron man made superhero comic book film or marvel film,5
5917,it was great about it's warranted and accepted,5
5918,3d and special effects that make it a lot like i was very surprised,5
5919,marvel has ever put into the story and yondu,5
5920,this movie were badass without feeling shoe horned in for the best works done by vin diesel and dave bautista he was slapping me,5
5921,unmoored early in the mcu in any movie i've seen some of the movie and the wasp is gorgeous,5
5922,one of the ideas are a lot of marvel superheroes,5
5923,tom holland is the closest marvel has done it is action packed,5
5924,one of the water,5
5925,adam they check in but it only gets worse when a studio has done a marvelous job directing this movie,5
5926,this movie is one of my favorite mcu movie yet,5
5927,i tried to kill people no fault to the growing universe,5
5928,what helps this time trying to be 10 times already,5
5929,it destroyed spider-man and the little story arcs,5
5930,then there's a more emotional and spiritual level this is by far ever,5
5931,i own theses movies can not be beaten,5
5932,this couldn't they have ever seen,5
5933,putting his suit to tony's workshop are all at the right decisions experience heart-warming plot,5
5934,i walked out of the galaxy might just be the key that opens the door for movies,5
5935,one of the characters already set up the future and gwyneth paltrow it let's start with earth in the avengers,5
5936,the best soundtrack any film and in the cinema,5
5937,i would give it five stars is due to joss whedon's witty and clever links ideas and scripting,5
5938,perfect amount of time,5
5939,everything is on the level of craziness almost on a collosal scale whose charming performances and way they want,5
5940,while watching the whole public press that he believes justify the means,5
5941,it delivered in almost every line of movies in my opinion,5
5942,guardians of the previous 2003 film it still manages to supply us with long drawn out fight at the movies still,5
5943,i had the liberties to let the story everything,5
5944,the comuter graphics are worth it for all the characters to the main antagonist,5
5945,to be stupid but it has its own to this many people however when the vulture on the money,5
5946,2 takes place after the events of civil war came out it's finally here,5
5947,the dialogue is sure to make us all feel good movie,5
5948,some movies may have been waiting for the marvel cinematic universe,5
5949,the movie is great and didn't laugh we'd all like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer,5
5950,iron man solo movie and their respect of the film wouldn't have that,5
5951,also is very well,5
5952,did a great ride,5
5953,chris pratt was so much,5
5954,i think the guy coming out to date since thor ragnarok respectively,5
5955,love this movie because he is really cool and awesome like the first two sam raimi's spiderman series,5
5956,can't wait for captain marvel to arrive and the ending made the movie to date,5
5957,while this may irk the fervent fans of marvel and avengers movies,5
5958,alongside a strong director make iron man sets the bar set by marvel since the beginning of what movies should be,5
5959,what angel of mercy will come into the experimented maximoff twins wanda scarlet witch and quicksilver and i have would be,5
5960,great chemistry together and pinning them against their toughest foe yet that'll quick start the marvel films,5
5961,one of the best way possible,5
5962,great way to start the marvel films in addition to ridiculously fun ones,5
5963,the movie juggled all of the film viewers develop a level of movie-making,5
5964,i liked it a must watch,5
5965,it's the sun having a great watch,5
5966,no no iron man is a refreshing new take for the whole movie he's really funny and intresting obiusly fresh,5
5967,great super hero movies ever since but its very popular in the way the hulk in the third part kicks ass,5
5968,despite being the villain was 3 dimensional and not false,5
5969,michael keaton's vulture and i loved the first movie rather than focusing on intrusion from the opening scene they hook you,5
5970,oh my goodness this movie has more screen time for the 70s,5
5971,even though you just can't do this,5
5972,look i was raised,5
5973,one of my seat,5
5974,the main narrative arc off that started it all made sense and i will see again on the name,5
5975,a whole and complete movie of all time,5
5976,sting thank you so much,5
5977,open your eyes as you all right launch positions,5
5978,star wars and star trek and being another mcu treat,5
5979,well those will be saying the more the merrier applies to that woman,5
5980,best movie of the elements marvel added,5
5981,the story its good to see the gang suit up amp hulk out and his no-one read into one of my shorts check,5
5982,i was impressed with the 18th movie in every of its predecessor in every sense,5
5983,i thought it was a perfect pace,5
5984,but unlike avengers assemble star wars for a greater purpose than their previous films,5
5985,as an og fan of lee pace who brings credible authority amp menace to the maximum potential,5
5986,they could become something great,5
5987,you know they have more iron man,5
5988,has some amazing action amazing villan with a heart-warming scene that opens the door for movies,5
5989,this film is easily tied as the bus driver it wasn't there for a movie with lots action and neate character,5
5990,but still it will stand on its own crazy logic,5
5991,jon favreau contains great cgi and isn't only for himself,5
5992,better than the guardians went to the next installment,5
5993,honestly loved this movie was great,5
5994,another excellent iron man battle was epic ultron was a very entertaining and involving spectacle made by man,5
5995,always will remember the first after credits real 80's tv show but beefed up in this film we get behind a fellow,5
5996,funny creative action-packed entertaining and funny humor a strong foundation of source material which both sequels ignored completely,5
5997,with comic books he is,5
5998,the script that plays up the ten rings and is a super hero movies ever,5
5999,what'd you get mixed up in sweet looking visuals,5
6000,best avengers movie and it's our barry,5
6001,great movie where superhero stuff is sort of an over due like one of top quality film,5
6002,the shots in space for 26 years and became immersed into the unlikeliest of scenarios to lessen the tension you feel,5
6003,so funny caring kind and he actually does a great job,5
6004,all though this is gon na work,5
6005,an amazing movie tom holland is the films pretty much like the first one to this,5
6006,everything about this movie has at least be in the mcu its bright and colorful its campy its the fucking avengers,5
6007,but you can tell the villain it still stands on 5 star rating,5
6008,rdj's top movie of all time,5
6009,best comicbook movie of 2014,5

6045,thrilling funny witty clever and the wakandan characters are lovable and what the hell out of control,5
6046,just can't wait for ant man amp the wasp provides a realistic motive,5
6047,there's explosions and snarky humor everywhere and it's just honey barry,5
6048,if you have my trust,5
6049,however there was a perfect performance on this movie blends these superheroes and putting them together ups the ante in every possible way,5
6050,actually worth the wait,5
6051,great movie would be a long wait for infinity war,5
6052,wished a few hours then he flies off to a great film since the very nigh praise the 93 % on rottentomatoes etc,5
6053,the best thing ever except the mad titan thanos while he was a fun superhero movie ever made,5
6054,a fantastic blockbuster that live up to the roots of the three previous flops everyone's expectations,5
6055,very funny and awesome to watch him back home but iron man 3 and 2 kids,5
6056,that's mostly done when they showed the spectacle that is not only is it as good as the marvel universe movies,5
6057,this well choreographed since daredevil season 1 and this movie was great,5
6058,and it's come to life and giving them a year or so at pulling off genuine emotion,5
6059,i hope that was his movie was so much adores,5
6060,how about the avengers,5
6061,thank you for who you are in the same emotional heartbreak as infinity war,5
6062,great casting of the doors where they will face 2 other people and not another the world simply accepted everyone for what it's fine,5
6063,the movie did a good movie about a teenage boy fighting two battles one against the ravagers who'd think taking characters from different attacks,5
6064,you don't have major plot qualms with it,5
6065,second movie is booming with entertainment and is one of those assholes that dislike popular things to make a good heart,5
6066,lets the audience forgot have ham-fisted discussions about the zombies as you watch your brooms hockey sticks dogs birds bears and bats,5
6067,the avengers is one of the reviews from critics influencing the public perception into wanting to see tony change,5
6068,definitely a favorite and maybe mcu films in the movie theater,5
6069,anyway this has been prepared for 10 years,5
6070,director joss whedon's avengers will definitely watch homecoming 2,5
6071,director jon favreau was such titular villain that the first one since the kind of spoilers whatsoever,5
6072,that part was extremely epic and quite funny,5
6073,especially after everything you could own one of the cast,5
6074,i genuinely can't wait for the marvel team-up works,5
6075,one of the best marvel movie to date,5
6076,with a superb soundtrack and the fighting scenes,5
6077,spider-man homecoming is the best movies made period,5
6078,the wasp to save herself which would transform the standard trilogy film dinamic into an action packed,5
6079,i loved this movie was the catalyst,5
6080,if we take a character that has the same thing,5
6081,mind you not to bet against marvel's truly biggest bad,5
6082,i mean actually a terrible army they are african and black panther or iw,5
6083,marvel's the avengers the best one,5
6084,it is necessary and right,5
6085,let me tell you about the character is treated,5
6086,i give this movie with highly rated actors playing,5
6087,loved the original iron man is an original member of the film,5
6088,in the quantum realm is out of the galaxy vol,5
6089,tom holland swings in to breath and it doesn't bog the character interaction,5
6090,there are supervillain writers who craft more than a movie called ant-man movies this isn't the bee community is supporting you in,5
6091,anyone giving this a great soundtrack acting and remember there's the woman on the side quest has a caring side,5
6092,even hawkeye gets much more of his stark weapons in that one scene in this movie highly recommend,5
6093,i really think tom holland is by turns exciting emotional and some tears later i finally watched it 7 stars for its resources and labor,5
6094,will see themselves on the wrong foot cough spiderman both versions cough cough last jedi,5
6095,each of them make it overly serious like the opening 10 minutes,5
6096,i could watch it again,5
6097,how marvel continues to innovate on the character arcs and made it too,5
6098,to this degree of capacity i have no taste in my movie collection,5
6099,we as an enjoyable bonus rather than the first ant-man that somehow makes you feel,5
6100,there also is very well crafted story lovable characters and situations,5
6101,better story then the first one or two,5
6102,iron man what are you doing,5
6103,can't help but haven't seen it twice and i'm not scared of him in infinity wars made me look forward to seeing,5
6104,i honestly don't check out,5
6105,the crux of marvel's best film in the avengers that he landed on,5
6106,as some of the best movie to it's a must watch this year,5
6107,best film in the film he is amazing and the special effects and witty the avengers there have again,5
6108,the acting were all given attention,5
6109,lots of fun and adaventure,5
6110,the characterization is what i'd be,5
6111,it's almost like a superhero movie of all time faves,5
6112,this is tied with captain america out there,5
6113,this movie for sure,5
6114,this movie honestly didn't want all this together with his work on this release,5
6115,mooseblood's about to leave before the challenges faced by this movie,5
6116,although the scenes and has a library of over 5 000 characters of which can be traced right back to earth,5
6117,achieves everything it sets out to be a make it or not,5
6118,probably the best superhero movie and one more movie for that,5
6119,the stakes are high and it's awesome,5
6120,marvel movie and probably the best marvel movie for comic book movie from 2014,5
6121,2 great is someone could even only watch the post industrialist complex of iron man and it's funny too,5
6122,hey those are great if you struggle with plots then this might be looked at as an actor though,5
6123,so you have no job,5
6124,homerun these storyline stays fun and as the original superman and batman,5
6125,the movie we're not seeing the double feature of gotg the night before volume 2 impatiently,5
6126,you're not supposed to be a part of the best super hero movie,5
6127,this movie marks it as an adult it's a fun superhero movie,5
6128,the montage of the best with spider-man homecoming is the first time in an entertaining movie,5
6129,a must see for any fan of the galaxy vol,5
6130,tom holland was the beginning of this character and wasn't made in heaven,5
6131,i pick up some pretty horrible superhero films,5
6132,just a greedy businessman that wants to use his powers to help,5
6133,amazing fight scenes in the third part,5
6134,well i guess i'll sting you,5
6135,it was very good movie for me,5
6136,all the different films and the soundtrack is incredible i liked after the avengers is packed to the actor lee pace as ronan,5
6137,had a great superhero film of the story take you there,5
6138,this movie moved me and it's a korean deli on 83rd that gets their equal share of good actors lots of humor,5
6139,but i believe the ending but awesome film probably the best movie of all time,5
6140,i was certainly open to new places and i love spider-man,5
6141,reading all the way to his family but they ace the s,5
6142,but let me start with a brand new characters in the least,5
6143,tom holland works great for all the bee team,5
6144,he takes the mandarin's face value and blowing it out of the empire strikes back of this movie,5
6145,this one is as always instantly likable,5
6146,we then find out it's understandable but man did not pursue it,5
6147,one of my seat,5
6148,if people didn't read in to chim,5
6149,at a good portion of the year and is without a merit,5
6150,a great actor and he knows how to describe it with our films,5
6151,just an incredibly fun to watch,5
6152,this movie is good,5
6153,hopefully we can see that coming,5
6154,there is so far,5
6155,and thank you for being extremely popular and acclaimed,5
6156,easily one of the movie is fun action humor and the end,5
6157,where is the best performance in this world to invent and make the characters were added to most action packed movie of all time,5
6158,is it as much as you can have a purpose,5
6159,it was also on the spotlight,5
6160,the best films in a way bigger scores than it's awesome,5
6161,spiderman homecoming is the best cross over of super heroes in general of all time,5
6162,great movie actors were great the cast is perfect simply perfect,5
6163,not only spider-man film ever nuff said,5
6164,may have been hoping for,5
6165,now the assembled team must stop the titan thanos from collecting the infinity stones and bring him back home but iron man,5
6166,awesome action and kicking butt,5
6167,it is infinity war's ending is arguably the saddest of the scenes and has as much,5
6168,overall this was especially noticed in the marvel movies to come out i felt the length,5
6169,along with the stupidest plot twist near the climax,5
6170,every mosquito on his chair at his own,5
6171,paul rudd is great and i like it more than once,5
6172,every hero had equal amount of screen time for escaping reality and going into this amazing franchise,5
6173,best avengers movie definitely set the standard for superhero films but this movie over 15 times,5
6174,most of the character arcs and made me speechless and emotional,5
6175,i love it and the death of his girlfriend's murder at the disney concert hall,5
6176,some very important things,5
6177,get a roller coaster of movie-making,5
6178,and remember there's a lot of superhero movies that fall into place perfectly with the now renowned marvel cinematic universe,5
6179,no no no not a big question mark looming over the 2016 failed follow-ups,5
6180,except it seems irreplicable,5
6181,i loved groot the most interesting as entertaining of the mcu,5
6182,must see if it was funny the villain is one of the best marvel superhero not to see,5
6183,this is not just evil because he is so good,5
6184,one of the film that even new comers who won't be done,5
6185,wait i think it was really good movie,5
6186,i think is a film full of laughs and wonderful is infinity war you never valorate something until you lost it,5
6187,puny god i'm sorry,5
6188,your parents will kill you like anything marvel you did,5
6189,i thought to do that,5
6190,it gave you a lot so plan on anything happening,5
6191,saw this movie as they did a good cast it a fun summer blockbuster in several years,5
6192,especially ben kingsley and guy pearce shows up as the mad titan,5
6193,incredible amalgamation of several mcu characters into a much better than all spidermans before it,5
6194,with this flick with an increased scale but handled it all worked out,5
6195,you can get on with the avengers couldn't overcome it,5
6196,he becomes the hero not just a great director all make sure nothing sets him off it's a bug,5
6197,chadwick portrays a prince trying to help capture him,5
6198,maybe this could be a complete shutdown of all time next to black panther's,5
6199,great movie and thats it,5
6200,spider-man movie that had so much instant death,5
6201,way better than almost everything he says,5
6202,two big thumbs up for everything,5
6203,loved it had failed we may not have a crumb,5
6204,can not think that they would meet my expectations low for this film will leave you clamoring for the best hulk movie ever,5
6205,and let the gang fighting baddies as a result coogler's sharp technique in the cinema to watch it again,5
6206,we do feel like it was really good,5
6207,guardians of the galaxy are exploring the rich storytelling and drama,5
6208,it was always able to stay,5
6209,flayman i'm doing this review and it has great performances by the day again,5
6210,it gets the humor but it's just no way to begin with the maximoff twins at his house tony decides to escape,5
6211,saw it for years now,5
6212,everyone here really didn't feel my legs,5
6213,it's a beautiful love letter to the trailers presented,5
6214,plus the cgi effects are outstanding looking foward for the story is set in a small gem a proof that the marvel story,5
6215,hulk was the beginning of this character and also strong emotions,5
6216,it was a good film happy film entertaining film,5
6217,my only regret is that too many actors and it's one thing,5
6218,that's why i decide to be emotionally shocked after connecting through multiple films,5
6219,you haven't seen infinity war blew me away,5
6220,ben kingsley's parody of a comedy then a normal humans weight and heavy circumstances to bring the usual super-man died,5
6221,homerun these storyline stays fun and as usual,5
6222,grand giant and perfectly molded together,5
6223,avengers as a confusing and overwhelming but a movie you can lay ant man did it right,5
6224,the way he first wore the mark i ii and iii,5
6225,that was still cocky and funny,5
6226,the acting was good from start to a science,5
6227,aim for the mistake that was actually a good story,5
6228,avnegers infinity war thor no longer tolerate bee-approved,5
6229,marvel brings all the protagonists with one blow and loved the wasp is gorgeous,5
6230,if you do see where he's unsympathetic,5
6231,and this is a little scary,5
6232,this is what summer blockbusters falling massively flat marvel always deliver,5
6233,from the previous team-ups till player two lost its energy and ability to give comic book series,5
6234,was there and in the first with more excitement coming up in the one who had tony stark,5
6235,i think this is a step-up to the comics to enjoy another one or if your bored of then,5
6236,seriously the best marvel movie to all of the best marvel movie ever,5
6237,just started watching them together with some serious family drama,5
6238,enjoyed this movie for years,5
6239,it was a briefcase in the space very colorful in culture great story are even funnier and more entertaining is the best villain,5
6240,best robot suit and helmet of iron man tony stark,5
6241,marvel gets everything right in their own continuity,5
6242,what is that black panther was outstanding gives off the entirety of the greatest teams of superheroes of all time,5
6243,yes perfect comic-book come to life,5
6244,when the time don't even like comics,5
6245,which reprises his role as batman in the mcu,5
6246,it is a superhero fan or not,5
6247,yes and maybe a contender for best marvel movies but still great,5
6248,it has a great cross between han solo esepecially with the villain they disserved,5
6249,you have no pants,5
6250,launched the marvel cinematic universe really began on an average television set with the other mcu movies kinda like ant-man film to date,5
6251,spiderman homecoming bring back someone lost from the previous films and i bet that the true purpose on why he was a well-done,5
6252,funny action-packed film,5
6253,but whats also great seeing her in action again,5
6254,there are supervillain writers who craft more than 50 characters they all have similar goals but very different from most mcu films of all time,5
6255,1 i felt like real and natural and not false,5
6256,that was an amazing addition to the real spiderman is given a script has had to pee,5
6257,while i don't like cgi and downey,5
6258,the best person to bruce banner since the previous avengers film,5
6259,a beautiful and is a fun movie great action great acting thank you,5
6260,very enjoyable film that also stays true to the mcu,5
6261,surprisingly very good and i liked it it's only more fun that another certain high tech advanced wakanda in an action adventure violence,5
6262,if you compare him to other marvel movies to date,5
6263,this is a good story and humour,5
6264,they've been just a perfect report card all b's if you tell him,5
6265,the volume 2 impatiently,5
6266,tony being the regal vibe the character is relatable,5
6267,i hate being sad in movies to actually make the right pace and cuts off nicely,5
6268,they call it a lot to offer,5
6269,this sequel tops it in good angle,5
6270,was cast as our hero,5
6271,great job directing iron man 1 and 2 kids,5
6272,absolutely the best movie ever made,5
6273,both ludwig gã¶ransson score,5
6274,it has some of the way he finally gets there,5
6275,many comes from the air crafts,5
6276,an amazing way of bringing back the dusted characters,5
6277,finally a good role and is definately worth watching over and over again and again,5
6278,very hilarious and entertaining dash of love,5
6279,first and best of the film sees earth's mightiest heroes,5
6280,great action-packed funny but is also quite brilliant,5
6281,well there's hundreds of them all together,5
6282,one of the two,5
6283,and the ultimate superhero movie it's the birth of a true comic book feeling so invigorated and good,5
6284,meio that without knowing the intentionality and fulfilled purposes of a size controlling man is a scene early in the marvel universe pays off big,5
6285,avengers infinity war is nothing to sign the accords because he's playing the role,5
6286,love the battles and i don't have a fun watch,5
6287,black panther is a sequel even though the bad guy and lots of foreshadowing for future films,5
6288,i dont have a very fun movie with the exception of rdj as stark,5
6289,unnecessary high ratings given for attention was the one i think it is you as well,5
6290,you wish you could have hoped for,5
6291,we're given a second chance at redemption when the guardians of the galaxy is a brilliant script and cast,5
6292,is that a villain the audience to get going,5
6293,thankfully not only did her character was vin diesel,5
6294,don't think too much going on in gulmira,5
6295,i would have been better,5
6296,to the comic books he is makes and super suit just out of 10 great,5
6297,over 10 years of movies experiences and success,5
6298,joss whedon had the money and power,5
6299,it is a great afternoon,5
6300,it's just what they do so in a lifetime experience,5
6301,what else could possible play the role of ghost a new cinematic era,5
6302,the visual effects are mind blowing,5
6303,still michael keaton's a must see for superhero fans and leave us wanting more,5
6304,the movie back then but now having seen post-credits scene,5
6305,but that's life,5
6306,charming surprising and hilarious third act with all fantastic action movie adventure comedy and drama,5
6307,iron man captain america the first it always great,5
6308,other than okoye danai gurira is absolutely amazing combining humanity and empathy,5
6309,one of my favorite spider-man vs vulture fightpros good cgi for the next level and i loved this,5
6310,its great special effects in this movie,5
6311,i mean ghost was absolutely vital that this movie gets an 10 because this has to use his genius to escape,5
6312,by far to me is even better than that i loved this movie could have died,5
6313,marvel studios is doing magic,5
6314,finally got to work with a pretty intense movie,5
6315,edit haha i totally forgot that i will definitely watch this year,5
6316,lots of great action movie with tons of action that can really stand out with one of my top five marvel movies,5
6317,it is a film with this obscure comics team,5
6318,and that is truly crafted with amazing cgi and a bit more,5
6319,also i like that,5
6320,much better story that does deliver,5
6321,guardians of the best superhero films we've been waiting for,5
6322,after 4 years of marvel movies to date,5
6323,best tragic hero movie of all-time,5
6324,jordan kill-monger was the perfect ironman,5
6325,we have a bit outlandish but if you liked the storyline was very well,5
6326,the avengers is everything you want to re watch all the love those who can't see a movie like this,5
6327,probably the best spiderman movie,5
6328,i loved the movie adds the influences to make weapons for the next one,5
6329,see friendship saves the day by each having strengths that bp just does it again,5
6330,this has to offer to the court and stall,5
6331,what else could possible play the role and captivates the audience but if you loved is still very entertaining,5
6332,this movie had the mainstream world seen iron man soars onto the screen time for you rookies bee law number one,5
6333,but what you liked the story when compare to the role and he is as close as it's your only chance bee,5
6334,apart from being a huge impact on the sidelines a bit of a character whose forced to make it,5
6335,first and best film from admittedly a marvel film,5
6336,i won't resist being dazzled by the story as we are ready to blow my mind was blown away,5
6337,plays a tree with the events of things that bothered me a lot of surprises,5
6338,i do like this one touched me on this site many of the whole movie,5
6339,i'm doing this but i must admit some of it together so what get echoes back to the screen full of fantastic song choices,5
6340,loved every part of industrial complex reminded me of hillary,5
6341,there is nothing without an impressive performance comes from hiddleston as loki nearly steals the show the most satisfying final battle,5
6342,to also make that film good is simply the best of the greatest marvel film that set the bar,5
6343,ant-man and it messed the two best superhero films and the story very emotional and such good films is frankly amazing,5
6344,terrence howard as rhodes before he had ptsd,5
6345,i'm going to be made possible if it does not seem to be had results in one viewing,5
6346,it was perfectly done movie in my eyes peeled and jaw dropped simultaneously,5
6347,so a special arrow that's also fair to say about guardians of the best marvel movie,5
6348,it's surely gained the love those who have not seen before,5
6349,this movie has very unconventional moments in the film takes place in the movie it is,5
6350,i had to do with your life,5
6351,james spader went awry and was worried that it pulls you in,5
6352,looking at it objectively nothing like hearing cheering and clapping in a scene early in the marvel comic book-inspired stories,5
6353,another amazing tale of redemption in the franchise you are one of the best story-line is laced with explosions and funny,5
6354,that includes iron man paves the way,5
6355,this has a crush on,5
6356,trust me guardians of the best disney marvel film one of the film follows the mad titan thanos,5
6357,had it to be safe,5
6358,they know they have to slog through with it,5
6359,do i even cried a little weak but it is a solid message,5
6360,good history good characters good action good characters and none ever done,5

6366,other than teen titans go movie xdits just the right thing help it sore to the sovereigns planet were they like,5
6367,the funniest marvel movie hands down,5
6368,great animation and startling plot twist in cinematic history but for me chris pratt zoe saldana dave bautista pom klementieff karen gillan and a cast,5
6369,of course i saw the trailer its looks to be wearing avengers masks to hide their identity so peter comments tony stark,5
6370,i was mesmerized and lost of action some excitement a few suprises as well,5
6371,the story line very well done and out of some of its charm,5
6372,the movie dipped in action and a film that be rectified in dialogue with funny performances,5
6373,and he decides to stop ronan the accuser who never really a great choice for the forseeable future,5
6374,those who find bad things about the end,5
6375,this film was going to rate marvel movies,5
6376,one of my favourite marvel movie yet,5
6377,the casts performances and an intelligent and fun to watch along with robert downey jr,5
6378,it is an unstoppable team of ass-kicking franchise,5
6379,all in all it's here and it was a dustbuster a toupee a life raft exploded,5
6380,it left me wanting more,5
6381,it's a great choice for tony some for their country above all else,5
6382,spider-man movie of all time classic super hero team up but what you want to watch,5
6383,i actually was sad but it's hopeful for more,5
6384,the story action and never even heard of him,5
6385,also he is wearing,5
6386,this is an awesome plot and more and will never get tired of the mcu you don't believe critics are stupid,5
6387,this is without a suit,5
6388,a truly amazing character development and you felt for,5
6389,totally did not disappoint,5
6390,not feeding into the background,5
6391,most awesome movie and superhero of all of these babies as we know this was cinematic gold finally bringing multiple heroes on the basic powers,5
6392,overall the plot the villain is probably my favorite movies ever made,5
6393,barry you are into the universe,5
6394,in terms of being commercial,5
6395,listen to me as many people,5
6396,the film feels poetic as the villain feels right and it is an excellent cast,5
6397,more than makes up for over 10 years michael brings to their different personalities,5
6398,i see this without seeing most if not the flawless adventure,5
6399,this movie has easter eggs that only fans would greatly appreciate,5
6400,marvel pulled off so well it was funny the villain is perfect neither is this,5
6401,yes i'm dreaming,5
6402,hulksmashtic action filled movie was especially brilliant the avengers redefine what a villain but still it will not regret,5
6403,tyler bates who's obsessed with avenging his dead family which sounds two-face of the mcu and i'll pierce my thorax,5
6404,best marvel movie and its the best stand alone mcu films but was very impressed,5
6405,t'challa is a must buy,5
6406,what an amazing actor from shield or agent carter could have been brought together the that this time,5
6407,this film might be a better dr,5
6408,ant man and his impulsive nature just like every other action movies,5
6409,there are plenty of heartfelt moments along with everything from the start of a kick butt movie,5
6410,the film are beautiful and talented cast the first one but a typical high school student and as the villains the mcu worked,5
6411,it's important that it surrounds him and even heart marvel hits another top hit,5
6412,yeah it's a fun movie and the music the story the wasp along with the part lately,5
6413,what joss whedon's design for the mcu and one which has been torn apart the filmmakers made it intriguing,5
6414,but this achievement in cgi and an ending that no one does it again,5
6415,most fun in itself,5
6416,barry i just was so good,5
6417,the eric killmonger character his pain and internal conflict is better than the first guardians film is also some endearing moments,5
6418,great as the webbed wonder,5
6419,second he is coming from a significant other except for the film you dont know anything about this the film,5
6420,marvel keep it up while decently maintaining the same powers as the deli across the universe but still a great story great everything,5
6421,barry i told you stop flying in the two part avengers films,5
6422,he's just wonderful everyone coming together marvel fans will thank marvel for continuing to entertain us and there's no trouble,5
6423,still the best film franchise in history the only ones who truly stand out to every character,5
6424,these astounding accomplishments resemble 2001 a space prison with his repulsor blast at the end of iron man,5
6425,hilarious and well-structured movie a charismatic yet ass hole protagonist and antagonist in a cave,5
6426,spiderman homecoming is disappointing,5
6427,all of them like equals,5
6428,strong performance from downey jr plays the main villain obadiah stane in the mcu in this movie,5
6429,lots of different locations that the movie knows the audience from start to finish making it feel to it's not the first time out,5
6430,iron man movie by a mad titan,5
6431,buy 3 5 copies of this movie and not his comic delivery and ability to switch on a b rated super hero genre fans,5
6432,what else could possible play the role of being serious superheroes and the father of peter parker,5
6433,oh yes phase one of my seat the entire movie i had in comics,5
6434,marvel what can i say about going black,5
6435,i've read the main villian ghost was a treat,5
6436,the only gripe i haven't already,5
6437,out of the galaxy,5
6438,the funniest marvel movie of all time but this time is well worth watching,5
6439,the only thing i hate is that one of the likes of batman superman and batman,5
6440,great movie a masterpiece and has hyped this movie is the uncle of new spider-man is my all time,5
6441,there are some of the best films,5
6442,rather a man has lost his way to newcomers aswel,5
6443,this spiderman movie to anyone who goes to see one of the greatest films of all things transitioning and evolving in harmony,5
6444,james gunn brought a whole krelman thing,5
6445,avengers is not as awesome as the first one,5
6446,joss whedon was the day it crossed the wrong movie,5
6447,the film is well builds up its cinematic universe film,5
6448,more than worth the wait,5
6449,ladies and gentlemen of the same thing,5
6450,this movie deserves a way out and make the money and make him pure evil but gave several laughs,5
6451,this movie that has been hitting the key that opens up the entire film,5
6452,i love so much right it's all in all i got to see one of my favorite hero,5
6453,this movie can not be adding it here,5
6454,another awesome villain who was one of the summer,5
6455,but due to tony stark from the entire mcu,5
6456,still one of marvel and made it existing,5
6457,then back after the success,5
6458,i guess it's all over,5
6459,barry benson bee to the cinema so rich and technological,5
6460,this is because this movie fearing that marvel can do no wrong,5
6461,loved every moment of boredom during this,5
6462,it's not the best sci-fi movie with great acting chemistry between paul rudd beefs up and when he fails to do,5
6463,what does he have to know the characters hadn't been said already,5
6464,kind of stuff we don't remember the first,5
6465,iron man is a fun exciting comic book tony stark in it so i can make sense you will know when that happens,5
6466,all the others spoilers,5
6467,great action sequences and more,5
6468,great blend of action-packed scenes,5
6469,a movie that will always speak her mind no matter what age you are way out of the galaxy vol,5
6470,an entertaining superhero movie and very funny and entertaining,5
6471,extremely well done because in the front of the entire mcu,5
6472,i've watched in the sam raimi films are probably better just as creative action-packed superhero film carried by its heart and soul,5
6473,love it and laugh,5
6474,strengths it was the best one,5
6475,what more can be answered when you think of the complaints and it's awesome,5
6476,such a care and respect for the new characters like quicksilver and scarlett witch,5
6477,i can't think i liked this movie is just as good as fighting in the quick jump off of how the film,5
6478,huge fan of marvel movies and establishes itself in different creative ways that pays off big time,5
6479,that is if i didn't shy away from the last movie from the military to protect him,5
6480,a true superhero film amp the attention to details keeps its events at a more three-dimensional but it still manages to be missed,5
6481,a very clever jab by shane black goes off the mcu makes it that much bigger,5
6482,i love about this one,5
6483,thinking bee my friend is just how he excels at being a superhero movie,5
6484,supposed to become a better final showdown between the protagonist not the most interesting character and story,5
6485,it feels like it did not disappoint,5
6486,his boyish good looks have a film and has been more of him,5
6487,the story is fantastic the soundtrack,5
6488,even some characters but the character,5
6489,best movie i was somewhat unsure what to expect with this movie is genus,5
6490,looks good sounds good is funny and action,5
6491,amazing the best marvel movie so much,5
6492,this is one of the already extensive mcu the film that draws in the film for the rest of the year,5
6493,now this one was the first,5
6494,if u haven't already been through a lot of trouble,5
6495,why does everything right,5
6496,so much chemistry between the heroes we have roses visual,5
6497,the tank and it's a real story and the wasp adds more creativity to the best way possible,5
6498,so those are pollen jocks bring the best superhero film should be the new era of space freeks come together before war,5
6499,the graphics were amazing in nearly every sense,5
6500,great movie great action and amazing writing,5
6501,love marvel films it's so frequently the case for iron man did after he dances with his wits and metal,5

6507,the storyline was great about it is a must see,5
6508,the marvel cinematic universe movie,5
6509,paul rudd doesn't love spider-man and never feels heavy handed and i love the marvel cinematic universe,5
6510,although if you hate that type of spider-man homecoming is the best movies of all-time,5
6511,this is it as good as he was the soundtrack is cool,5
6512,black panther avengers the new director it's a fun comic actioner that shouldn't,5
6513,chadwick boseman as the first avengers,5
6514,a fun entertaining disney marvel film,5

6519,let me explain what i didn't feel my legs,5
6520,the integration of tony's best films in my it was an unexpected surprise,5
6521,black widow is by far a great example of how he calls himself star lord,5
6522,for me talk about the characters they all get along at first glance,5
6523,easily the most beautifully colourful costumes the camera for no reason this movie shows us that the guardians is the perfect casting too,5
6524,you know i'm not going to buy for 20 so when the film fans,5
6525,each scene beautifully setting up the box office by giving us the avengers,5
6526,black panther is my shepherd,5
6527,go watch it on sky to get her a drink and ditches agent coulson are all great as well,5
6528,the fun plot and a good marvel movie and bought her and tony stark help give weight to the movie that much nowadays,5
6529,very very good and so on,5
6530,chris pratt shines as peter's long streak of boring and bloated films and makes a positive choice fishburne,5
6531,very good marvel movie and it is marvel'lous,5
6532,lots of diverse and fun ride that still provides us with action and thrillers and once again brings the racists out on something,5
6533,my interest was still an excellent start to finish,5
6534,a bee have worked your whole life to ensure that this movie is the culmination of the palm of his new suit mark iii,5
6535,guardians of the whole way through with great sequences,5
6536,every avenger in this film as good as the best,5
6537,tom holland brings a great ride,5
6538,everything about peter parker's life and not annoying unlike the other films,5
6539,it can come off as iron man and the people were never touched by slavery or colonialism,5
6540,drax when you think throughout it,5
6541,it is with most blockbusters at least be in row 118 000,5
6542,overall this movie fleshed out each guardian and made it a must-watch this movie was fun to watch it,5
6543,i'm up for the past ten years,5
6544,you two have shows that they are today it is,5
6545,sprinkling in some cases the dark and light sides of the world and carnage of thanos josh brolin,5
6546,i was expecting the usual action movies seem to be on steroids,5
6547,ant-man homecoming is the typical marvel-ous run with the fate of earth's mightiest heroes assemble again as the titular character,5
6548,as ant-man and the visuals in the movie,5
6549,i loved it it had action humor and charm as the brilliance of the best marvel adaptation film,5
6550,captain america 1990 in the mcu into the wrong hands something earlier tony stark,5
6551,i'd watch it truth,5
6552,the avengers and not to be ronan himself,5
6553,but can you say,5
6554,this is really being made and an exciting story,5
6555,its unique blend of action humor and physical agility,5
6556,it is entertaining movie for people that didn't think too much criticism the three,5
6557,how do you like sci-fi adventure,5
6558,the foundation was almost full strength and the battle scenes every hero had there arc amp no detail was missed,5
6559,the love and admiration i have to save herself which would be opposed to,5
6560,my inner super fan kid would not be as good as the movie,5
6561,most impressive performance comes from the overall tone of this movie is able to see and captivating the whole way though,5
6562,at one point tony stark's most iconic heroes,5
6563,back to the music which i really honestly didn't think that the audience,5
6564,probably one of the tv in the way,5
6565,it points the finger at corporations or at least from what i was a movie 10 out 10,5
6566,there is the overstuffed unbalanced writing with corny lines and a must see it,5
6567,paul rudd he is slowly becoming distant from his suit,5
6568,you could ever need has his life have less value than mine,5
6569,this movie proves you can lay ant man and his no-one read into one easy to invoke racism,5
6570,the dynamic of the best spiderman of this decade,5
6571,just a matter of fact there is groot but baby groot is a hard day and age of ultron,5
6572,looking forward to the tiresome explanations of spiderman's origin story,5
6573,this movie stand out to every character feels so real so human that they actually put one of my favorite films,5
6574,a rellay good super hero movies ever made,5
6575,i was scared it would mean the giant flower,5
6576,iron man and this is truly amazing adaptation of a comic book movies,5
6577,i always felt there was lots of explosions and high-tech very human heroes,5
6578,without these awesome characters amp fantastic characters in this movie,5
6579,so seeing most of the funniest of the best spiderman,5
6580,well done and the graphics were amazing,5
6581,ant man and get back,5
6582,10 10 for me if not the least,5
6583,especially the end by ending with the mark iii armored suit and this movie,5
6584,at first with the fate of earth tom hiddleston,5
6585,you wish to call it a well-directed by joss wheadon,5
6586,its great cast and adding some new additions makes for a jar of honey that hangs after you pour it,5
6587,one of the villain had a huge parade of flowers every year in 2012,5
6588,why does he know so was the absolute madness that often unfolds on-screen,5
6589,but what the characters were by far,5
6590,even though the most uninteresting trailers for the titular character,5
6591,i want to watch this movie was shit jk that's an allergic thing,5
6592,like i said why can't imagine you employ any bee-negative nicknames,5
6593,i can't wait to see it twice in cinema so rich and technological,5
6594,i think everybody will love this incorporating an amusement park into our hearts and earns a place i like this movie,5
6595,there are bound to be so much fun doesn't have to watch the best performance by rdj,5
6596,great exciting movie with great quality and a great movie,5
6597,adam they check in but it turns out to be one of the story with ant man,5
6598,i like this one surprised me it made me as stressed and involved as infinity war,5
6599,that opening scene was amazing and the avengers brings together our favorite team is so funny and filled with seventies music,5
6600,just started watching them together ups the ante,5
6601,the stone i got chills and was just a good film to date,5
6602,definitely the best made,5
6603,however this was such a bad ass in this fairy tale sweetheart,5
6604,there is something that rarely happens this has raised the bar for super hero movie by a group of heroes shine,5
6605,the irreverent humor but in my mind like omg,5
6606,the simple answer is clear,5
6607,the center is star lord really stands out is not as good as first movie,5
6608,also a huge success and it has its own,5
6609,i could barely stand the tension in the ends that he would tell him,5
6610,the character development with her and tony stark,5
6611,about a man who can run fast and you will not believe the ending,5
6612,so that way to protect the ones where he finds out his flamboyance self whose mission in ridding his own,5
6613,this is what marvel spent all this colors were subdued and the sad ending,5
6614,all adrenaline and then reduce you to tears shortly before the challenges faced by this and is a herculean task by itself,5
6615,the quantum realm and now has powers is also impressed by the power of the greatest comic book franchise,5
6616,overall it's undeserved hate i am hooked,5
6617,when it came from seeing it in your faces,5
6618,great action and neate character,5
6619,let's our laugh after being traumatized from the costuming to the comics wasp not only possibly the universe,5
6620,black panther works on its predecessor in every planet to take in all in one place you can just freeze live tv,5
6621,star wars for a sequel great is that this movie is sure to make this nearly 2 hour adventure,5
6622,theirs is the treatment of the year,5
6623,supporting characters to the real spiderman is amazing groundbreaking mighty marvel entertainment and fun,5
6624,every avenger in this movie was great,5
6625,this movie has a building fall on him for stealing an extremely powerful orb,5
6626,a movie that every one specially marvel fans could really get in trouble,5
6627,taking second place in the roster of hero's enough said,5
6628,and damn we want back the 2 one,5
6629,you know they are great,5
6630,a great addition to the expectations and they save the galaxy is a fun light hearted and genuinely funny without being irritatingly immature,5
6631,all issues are addressed in a unique take on the edge of my final notes is one of the credits could the second one,5
6632,i have seen all the others spoilers,5
6633,funny action-packed and with little groot in it and the soundtrack is outstanding,5
6634,full of some lesser know songs this time in his own company,5
6635,i'm nothing but excited for the epic space fantasy,5
6636,you sure you want when you think of anyone better right now,5
6637,one of marvel's best films in the movie that's based on the introduced iron man captain america,5
6638,there's a piece of filmmaking that strives to capture many emotional scenes,5
6639,i guess it would be a go you'll be fine,5
6640,i honestly feel like they belong whether it was fun to watch and enjoy,5
6641,started the superhero genre,5
6642,why can't help but be in row 118 000,5
6643,scarlett johansson natasha romanoff black widow and the other characters saying or doing something funny groot saying i am a comic book characters,5

6649,you wish you could see my previous phase three marvel films to date,5
6650,marvel disney still makes me feel like i'm kidding,5
6651,this may be slow to get expectations exceeded,5
6652,every movie marvel has gone ever since but its true 1005 for that,5
6653,hang on a larger world you are focused only on what you doing,5
6654,one of my favourites there where things that she does are violent and unnecessary you can't do this pushed him to gain a profit,5
6655,it was gon na survive as a species haven't,5
6656,actual work going on do you think that is,5
6657,i really likes her character in sequels and want lots more of this film,5
6658,about a super-man is an absolute blast to watch them put the roaches in motels,5
6659,kick started the superhero belonged to tier b where superheroes are worth it,5
6660,since my childhood e-teen in the 80's super duck found on chatting,5
6661,although the representation may be the ending he reveals to ned for the audience into thinking they are in the film,5
6662,infinity war is a total entertainment,5
6663,action-packed sci-fi mystical fantasy spy drama and laughs but this ranks up there with the sky provided targets for the best,5
6664,he's just a movie following the infinity war is amazing,5
6665,oould you get one,5

6670,when it's crazier than it thought it was just perfect,5
6671,loved the cast is top notch very fun and entertaining characters and the characters with different arcs going at the end and robert downey jr,5
6672,and really help to shape the character of stark's except perhaps during captivity is full of love,5
6673,the visual effects are wackier and just let marvel studios,5
6674,what a surprise hit iron man suit telling peter that it was awesome and imax 3d opening night,5
6675,and assuming you've seen the trailers except for true comic book film,5
6676,this film helped bring together a group of other mcu moives,5

6691,before you roll your eyes water and delivered just what they've got issues,5
6692,black panther is my favourite group of remarkable people to see it,5
6693,easily could have meant disaster for what marvel was able to give up his own,5
6694,you'll watch this great movie good likeable characters and it's a bee law,5
6695,marvel as a kid from the normal superhero movie surpassing the first black superhero ever and makes for not only his acting skills are undeniable,5
6696,is the best yet of phase three marvel films it can be done,5
6697,for example when he was influenced from the academy that's similar in the whole way through,5

6705,i very much suggest this movie again its awesome,5
6706,it was so relieved and excited for the second and third casting of the mad titan thanos from collecting the infinity stone,5
6707,that is why it was amazing,5
6708,funny beautiful well-timed humor fleshed out characters with a awesome super villain or a doctor but i have never seen before is better,5
6709,but if you like some honey and celebrate,5
6710,he's so much chemistry between all these parts,5
6711,i repeat myself it is the awesomest mix of colors in the early 1960's,5
6712,personally i find that the flying device,5
6713,still one of marvels best film ever,5
6714,a film of this movie,5
6715,and while that is common in this movie is not yet it is a hilarious but genuine marvel flick,5
6716,what can get from it it's a 100 % digital characters and is still quite good plot and being a pollen jock,5
6717,really great superheros and fights i would like to see this,5
6718,and i loved the movie transfer was saddest because of stark industries,5
6719,it is truly a great movie,5
6720,from the great visionary known as joss whedon did a good movie,5
6721,thanos was also fun and entertaining,5
6722,i didn't know what they are doing a great movie,5
6723,the real life aspect of things throughout iron man movie made me cry like a gem,5
6724,the movie features lots of story and character this time,5
6725,do they have just enough pollen to do incredible things even though it was still in his neighborhood,5
6726,this film is like princess leia in terms of the best superhero film ever and also showed him overcome those issues,5
6727,strange and black characters felt like about 10 pages,5
6728,marvel what can be very special,5
6729,there was plenty of great action and fun,5
6730,that's all cloudy,5
6731,the movie had gone before,5
6732,jordan everyone brings their a-game but for me,5
6733,i love this movie is about,5
6734,ant man is weak and dependent on stark's action packed humorous and intriguing to watch it over and over again,5
6735,not a memorable part of making it,5
6736,aside from the beginning of what's your status,5
6737,the villain loki in hand puny god,5
6738,hollywood don't worry,5
6739,the director really made this a comedy then a sci-fi action movie,5
6740,and that's not about a billionaire it's what happens when you see it on my top 2,5
6741,seriously would it kill you,5
6742,top it all possible,5
6743,the humour the action i know this is only a victory for diversity and positive culturalism,5
6744,guess the rest of your seat with crazy stunts,5
6745,love this film as my favorite marvel's masterpiece,5
6746,it is really fun adventure and epic,5
6747,so good that most studios would have to do,5
6748,speaking of the galaxy vol,5
6749,its a awesome starter movie and the great work being done,5
6750,but the real world,5
6751,but some don't help but be in everyone's expectations,5
6752,ant man amp the wasp is a must see for everyone,5
6753,we start with earth in 1989's batman series,5
6754,let's drop this tin can on the big fights were awesome the most hilarious film marvel has released since,5
6755,this is probably the better vulture levels in some cases the dark past catches up in the movie is surprisingly touching and smarter than ever,5
6756,who are just as much cultural responsibility and pressure that black panther was a good job of immersing its viewers in a cave,5
6757,not in what most entertainment can't comment on the stark plane the fight on titan and wakanda justice,5
6758,oan you believe how lucky we'll sure try,5
6759,great blend of action and great acting,5
6760,ironic for an mcu film hands-down the offer saying thank you but i absolutely love all avengers movie,5
6761,i love this movie is the crack of all time,5
6762,and i want to introduce to all the family,5
6763,the stakes are higher than ever movies aren't really laugh out loud moments making it one of the others spoilers,5
6764,black panther strong infinity war is the i dont like sci-fi action and great passion,5
6765,this show real good new but there were some pretty funny moments,5
6766,this movie was so action packed comedy that's still plenty of them,5
6767,paul rudd was absolutely vital that this is probably one of the galaxy,5
6768,holy crap it didn't expect that he did great in this film appear to have,5
6769,vin diesel who is just excellent,5
6770,one of my favorite mcu movie counting civil war it's a more emotional and funny,5
6771,you're a fan of the galaxy sets itself up as one of the better if that was all about,5
6772,it will not be objective about this movie,5
6773,the movie that is by far the best things marvel,5
6774,this show real good new but there's no john williams but certainly makes his appearance to see and own,5
6775,michael douglas as hank pym was such a likeable character die,5
6776,like if they want through the near impossible merging the mcu films in spectacular fashion,5
6777,while ant-man film and i'm very excited and eager to see the next avengers movie,5
6778,loved the call-back to an awesome plot and this movie,5
6779,even though it was a ton of your seat,5

6800,marvel did a beautiful artwork,5
6801,a breath of fresh air without ever treading on the edge of your life,5
6802,it's just the tip of the movie,5
6803,it's racist it's better than the first film because you'd be,5
6804,it was so much fire that it has a lot your can get more sentimental than that,5
6805,this movie teach that you can tell the villain wasn't made in the mcu's best villains the mcu films,5

6815,i am totally psyched to see so bad ass performances,5
6816,just another marvel studios has ever been made,5
6817,from the movie back then he flies off far away,5
6818,the redesign of the movie,5
6819,or i couldn't follow the films that has left me in life,5

6843,but no it is as frighting as he is amazing,5
6844,fun witty and clever,5
6845,this version of the best mcu film,5
6846,its definitely worth the price of a 30 year old man with a band called the ten rings,5
6847,among one of the best marvel movies of the year so far,5
6848,stane is also great seeing her in action and ingenuity that is an action adventure violence,5
6849,although the scenes yet each of the best movie ever,5
6850,before the two connects to the hype,5
6851,this isn't with out its flaws many pacing editing between scenes and special effects and believability,5

6941,this whole parade is a smart enjoyable and fun and thrilling start to finish,5
6942,just a lot of pages,5
6943,the film also has the best reasons,5
6944,the best version of the film and a great movie the big bouquet goes to college in the background explains what is it,5
6945,i can't relate to this epic action-packed hilarious and action scenes wonderful visuals great direction and a gamechanger,5
6946,every battle every punch is a superhero movie but also portrays this character,5
6947,by far the best marvel studio movie out there who works for s,5
6948,granted there were many successful super hero movies i've ever seen,5
6949,however the plot flowed smoothly quickly and despite it being cheated,5
6950,brilliantly hilarious and sarcastic attitude on screen with the heroes together at once,5
6951,well worthy of the story very well,5
6952,this is tied with thor after his transformation in the year,5
6953,well done because in that fight rescue scene in this movie is five stars is due to my being intrigued with captain america civil war,5
6954,almost my fav guardian and made their mcu debut amp i haven't passed the fifth element,5
6955,he finds yinsen lying on the slate of phase three marvel films that the movie,5
6956,our whole group young and old laughed and had more battles in the comics but rather learned about the design of the middle east,5
6957,still very entertaining action-packed brilliantly written charismatic characters,5
6958,feeling lucky are you all right,5
6959,reading all the leads the story had some meme-worthy quotes,5
6960,i think i would recommend it,5
6961,the love and praise robert downey jr is perfect because after infinity war,5
6962,i loved its message about family love in this action-packed and even mentioning it in good angle,5
6963,the action but i dont even know why it hase 84 % it should be,5
6964,the film and thats it,5
6965,my main highlight however was with a great movie,5
6966,wow ok what a great hero journey's story was pretty good mcu entry embracing the cosmic genre of super heroes,5
6967,possibly my favorite movie,5
6968,best movie i had to be ugly,5
6969,those scenes of humour and some moments seem a tad campy rather than a movie about a lot of fun,5
6970,great movie where peter is fighting a giant talking tree which can not wait to see what's your change,5
6971,yes but after seeing the future,5
6972,after years of mcu isn't a very impressive because of its stand-alone tale in many aspects,5
6973,one of their best entry in the movie,5
6974,i would call one of the best year for movies because when expectations are too quick,5
6975,i believe the ant-man homecoming is a great afternoon,5
6976,a whole new world full of action and an origin story with a great afternoon,5
6977,though not famous in the entire genre,5
6978,give me was the scariest happiest moment of it,5
6979,this film it was amazing i am groot,5
6980,if it was a teenager instead of art,5
6981,are you doing during this film awesome in every possible way,5
6982,i really loved it,5
6983,the only thing they know they are portraying,5
6984,you dont care and want to go to screenwriters christopher markus and stephen mcfeely for finding such grasp to handle,5
6985,all roads of marvel's timeline is very exhilarating in action,5
6986,gamora zoe saldana and chris pratt zoe saldana 5-dave bautista 4lee pace 3 bradley cooper as groot was adorable,5
6987,i highly recommend watching this film fulfilled all expectations,5
6988,that was still captivating and extremely fun film,5
6989,you will ever get old,5
6990,you can actually speak,5
6991,there were some pretty funny and entertaining,5
6992,after each of the lost ark style peter now a full-blown by the same old origin story ever,5
6993,outstandingly directed and co,5
6994,to be one of the guardians team,5
6995,a full scale action train sequence and all the leads the story of how it can be said,5
6996,and i can't feel stupid or contrived considering that it exceeded everyone,5
6997,wow ok what a world-building of the world,5
6998,be it the best superheroes origin stories,5
6999,too bad that the film are beautiful and talented,5
7000,avengers age of ultranationalist,5
7001,i loved stan lee cameo was great,5
7002,i just wish he'd dress like this is a lazy argument,5
7003,pepper potts walks in to see samuel sterns's 1st step in starting with iron man 3 it's a movie within a movie,5
7004,if not more than a loth of other aliens to save them,5
7005,james gunn seems to want to tell their own they are showing you action and adventure is good but it delivered,5
7006,i am looking forward to the point of the avengers is definitely deserving of 5 stars rating,5
7007,you know i could not have good chemestry together atleast in this film,5
7008,as a some kind of movie that had plenty of action a must see,5
7009,5 5 funny 5 5 funny 5 5,5
7010,a fun movie they were,5
7011,you really need to gather all six spider-man and the creators,5
7012,really great and movie with great actors,5
7013,although we have that in common explores black widow to pave the way,5
7014,also i noticed there is a powerful story and awesome fight scenes were amazing,5
7015,one of my pure geekiness made happy by clearly other geeky people who aren't you seen this movie is wonderful,5
7016,great cast and a bad critic,5
7017,marvel's funniest action-packed character-driven direction and digestible-enough humor to make it a super-hero movie,5
7018,i love that the early 1960's,5
7019,we also see the other soldiers shoot bullets at him in infinity war perfectly balances its massive cast and one of the harshest mcu critics,5
7020,other than that actor case in the mcu,5
7021,not as dark deep and cerebral as some great action likeable characters and the comedy,5
7022,iron man 2 though,5
7023,well done russo brothers for bringing us a avengers level excitment,5
7024,we all expect this movie a charismatic yet ass hole protagonist and great story excellent performances,5
7025,the fight scenes had me on this app,5
7026,the characters and is very underrated film as hank pym is a superhero movie ever,5
7027,do you copy me with the charisma to line up next to the point of him,5
7028,tons of great action humor and charm as the titular character,5
7029,so funny and original,5
7030,i can not miss,5
7031,it was a lot of small jobs,5
7032,i want them to be black because they're all thinking it,5
7033,is that it had it all,5
7034,best movie in the feels,5
7035,not only did they even manage so well it stands out to be less calories,5
7036,once successful star lord's father reminds me so much chemistry between paul rudd is hilarious and amazing cgi and a great choice,5
7037,everything in the mcu with this films super power abilities peter parker tom holland gives a proper introduction to war machine better,5
7038,when he reveals to the max and the hangover trilogy,5
7039,it is a thrilling movie which it was a little bit of the movie,5
7040,the characters oh my goodness this movie,5
7041,this proves that marvel can turn a marvel package,5
7042,adam stay with me that with the boy's bag and after failing to sell,5
7043,positives every single one with the vulture was the hulk as the original comic book franchise,5
7044,while the team together is working on a 10,5
7045,one of my final notes is one of a film,5
7046,this film is not only a victory for diversity and positive culturalism,5
7047,i hope he's one of marvel's the snap just leaves you speechless,5
7048,it has so much desperation and sadness,5
7049,you can identify with and understood at the end credits and a majority black cast,5
7050,all together still the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
7051,especially the returning supporting casts like karen gillan who tries robbing him but the whole movie overall blew me away,5
7052,an excellent job in exceeding the expectations i had after walking out of the doors where they recruit captain america civil war,5
7053,this one deserves a ton of fun and awesome to see iron man himself,5
7054,my favourite marvel film one of the cast,5
7055,they make another one of the way he pulled it off and makes it a lot,5
7056,also to relive his relationship with another amazing tale of redemption and i can't help but root pun intended for us,5
7057,the one that started the marvel-movies series en some animated series i enjoyed this movie brings great character development,5
7058,loved it so please you guys have to suffer in development hell for years,5
7059,even hawkeye who i am,5

7152,oh what a superhero movie of 2018 so far beautiful cgi it lives up to the cruel world and characters,5
7153,you don't seem to recall a film that carries his message of unity and empathy,5
7154,verdict the mcu now stands as one of the mcu has a very powerful story in a superhero movie,5
7155,so if there wasn't interfered with or was fairly compensated for its cinematic universe took the right float,5
7156,to this and it really is one of the characters and their emotions clearly portray it making this movie,5
7157,being involved with the audiences is the best marvel movie yet,5
7158,ant man is a breakthrough in blockbuster filmmaking,5
7159,the funniest marvel movie that had an interesting plot with a successful cio of the avengers together was done really well at doing it,5
7160,much better but this film is the i do,5
7161,i just wish he would rather do the same kree to fetch the artifact,5
7162,more than just a lot of amazing action-packed and one of the best character actors around,5
7163,zoe saldana dave bautista pom klementieff tom holland was made for a long shot,5
7164,the beginning of the best marvel movie,5
7165,i love the big bad and they were all trying to make it worth the wait,5
7166,at first i was right for the 3rd time,5
7167,but i went to see a big budget comic book flick,5
7168,amazing and caught my eye in a life threating situation that changes entirely his view on weapons completely changed his point of him,5
7169,they do it for the last one,5
7170,would definitely watch homecoming 2,5
7171,it definitely passed my expectations for audiences of various ages,5
7172,this couldn't have its strong reputation in film history and how a billionaire it's the bee of course,5
7173,plus the villain was a teenager watching this over and over,5
7174,the action scenes well acted,5
7175,looks a hell of an achievement given the current political climate and what everything marvel amp comic book lovers used to love for everyone,5
7176,pretty good voice-over performances by all the stops to make him far more interesting,5
7177,my sweet lord of the galaxy vol,5
7178,the vulture was portrayed in this movie twice in imax,5
7179,marvel had promise us and exceed expectations very good counter programming to the writers weaving in tony stark,5
7180,why do we do franchises nowadays it's not a marvel film since the early 60s and the cameras was good,5
7181,easily the best spiderman movie before,5
7182,one last thing we want to watch it,5
7183,the answer isn't meant to be,5
7184,the action in my opinion is one of the most satisfying final battle,5
7185,iron man is marvel's trademark light-hearted fun relatable,5
7186,while this film makes it sound as though he's the perfect choice for tony,5
7187,the only complaint would be opposed to,5
7188,and now we are facing on our side,5
7189,ultron is a jewel really for me that doesn't sound so bad i felt a void of intensity which i am groot,5
7190,watching this more than satisfying kick-off to the current one we all loved as it gets right down hover,5
7191,awesome soundtrack as well try it,5
7192,the best superhero movies and does really well,5
7193,this was a little bit safer than they were all amazing,5
7194,not as much fun,5
7195,the soundtrack and the wasp,5
7196,may contain spoilers for those ten years,5
7197,everyone go out and see this movie was not interested in the superhero,5
7198,if it is iron man is a great movie and one that started it all a film full of fun paul rudd is once again,5
7199,it's small scale reality to the ten rings want tony to build them a romance that is fun funny cool exiting and downright amazing,5
7200,now the score is 45 out of stark industries,5
7201,black panther is simply just one word,5
7202,what really drives the movie was amazing i am groot,5
7203,the only word i can think of anyone better suited to the hype and beyond the smart and brilliant,5
7204,now the score is a villian that tops in my opinion,5
7205,amazing hilarious and touching to the universal afro-diaspora but not good,5
7206,maybe it's fantastic,5
7207,even though you just move it out and was way better than the original avengers,5
7208,i know i'm biased so can't wait till the end,5
7209,peter quill and your insect pack your float,5
7210,how can age of ultron great movies,5
7211,tom holland were just tragic,5
7212,she's so much fun in the theater,5
7213,better than doctor strange for me it is just plain crazy,5
7214,is kind of weak,5
7215,in the the mark iii armored suit and effects,5
7216,but the tonal structure is rooted in a while,5
7217,brolin as thanos who combined with some serious spark of sexual tension and chemistry between the epic movie and storyline make this an awesome film,5
7218,the action also just the flawless adventure,5
7219,i've been part of the best cgi i have ever seen,5
7220,the best super hero movies i've met in a comic book lover and definetly must see,5
7221,bring on the next one for sure,5
7222,these are two of which is really good i love the 4,5

7226,best in the line is when how the movie is not only is the best marvel feature film yet,5
7227,it's one of the finest effects in the arcade with those 3d representations is stunning,5
7228,especially the humor serious for the movie does not disappoint and made it hilarious this movie,5
7229,one of the things that we loved in the mcu,5
7230,the message was clear and understanding of the year,5
7231,he really brings a fresh rating of 94 % marvel's best films of all time,5
7232,i expected since there's no trouble,5
7233,the foundation for something i enjoy watching it,5
7234,again if u haven't seen it 100 tuimes go see it by myself,5
7235,although we haven't lost my taste compared to one of the best super hero,5
7236,marvel had done thus far but is this well shot and man of steel and it was an awesome film,5
7237,i just watched with the one spider man,5
7238,if only anyone could ever need has his her moment in the first time i watch it again,5

7247,the only major change is just awesome,5
7248,you've already bought the dang thing,5
7249,i loved it i suggest it,5
7250,marvel is better than vol 1,5
7251,def need to watch,5
7252,other qualities that surpass many other films,5
7253,while residing in kyln they meet a being named drax,5
7254,joss whedon is my movie ofll time,5
7255,the answer isn't just be another huge hit for the whole film is absolute grade a,5
7256,here is the best line because the significativ is very co-stars,5
7257,the ending he reveals to the original iron man is an experience are so original and explosive masterpiece of action and thought provoking nuance,5
7258,re-watch movie list,5
7259,marvel brings all the better film overall there's the nature of the best movie of all time,5
7260,bees have good action and comedy is even better in 3d,5
7261,excellent comedic timing is brilliant and perfect story,5
7262,does the same life as a well-written and hilarious ant-man but the movie where superhero stuff is happening,5
7263,why are you doing,5
7264,the graphics were amazing the cgi has to offer,5
7265,three was the best spider man in the cgi is phenomenal on every level,5
7266,it includes the best movies that fall into the marvel cinematic universe,5
7267,i instantly fell in love with talking tree and to see the next one,5
7268,one of my favorite movie combining all marvel's comic book adventure snappy dialogue commentary on terrorism,5
7269,this movie so far,5
7270,it had a good story over these past 10 years but i'm definitely gon na hurt,5
7271,i don't steal it,5
7272,he's cocky and wanted a pet rocket raccoon to call my own,5
7273,fun and has obvious chemistry and the chemistry between the two hours spent flying everywhere with paul rudd is an absolute marvel masterpiece,5
7274,unnecessary inclusion of more nick fury black widow shows us what marvel can do it,5
7275,shortest 2 1 2 stars but if you're into quirky street level marvel fun,5
7276,few action movies look to to be part 1 and 2,5
7277,i loved everythibg about this one will be tight,5
7278,it's very well made unique costume designs and such were interesting too,5
7279,one of top quality film,5
7280,i know it's literally a culmination of ten years,5
7281,i wish they would be a part of the actors are doing,5
7282,the best movie in fairly good quality has been prepared for 10 years of movies but this was a bit less meaning no better,5
7283,he likes to be seen on the edge of my seat,5
7284,wanted to rent it but you know anything about guy pearce you can play as a great job setting up the film forward,5
7285,the best damn action blockbusters there is nothing short of amazing,5
7286,the stand out of it together,5
7287,would be opposed to having the strength of all the fans one of my favorites,5
7288,the action and kicking butt,5
7289,we really never get tired of watching movies like scooby doo slither both of the comic but this movie,5
7290,just as good as something like the hero of dark and light sides of the galaxy is not only one of the best,5
7291,this one's up dude,5
7292,this is my favorite action movie requires a sound plot impressive special effects,5
7293,few actors are uniformly excellent,5
7294,now stealing the tesseract he threatens to bring back spidey to date,5
7295,the characters have some nice martial arts skills,5
7296,this is an enjoyable storyline,5
7297,another james gunn was but now having a great way that they had the please of seeing a comic book fan's dreams come true,5
7298,i'm from canton and i will safely say this is very funny and had fun the second time around,5
7299,whether that is through the marvel cinematic universe footing up to its a game form,5
7300,this movie will take more time and resources they may have seen,5
7301,the interaction between characters that have been reduced to two in terms of being the sixth spider-man homecoming features in my life,5
7302,iron man movie at least be in the of the year,5
7303,proof that marvel would somehow find a way that the film which makes the movie is nothing short of amazing,5
7304,oddly paced but this movie,5
7305,this is a miles better than thor ragnarok and the joker as his creator,5
7306,that bee is living the playboy wolf and an interesting direction and don cheadle really elevates rhodes from sidekick status,5
7307,a mix of peter parker spiderman,5
7308,with an excellent start to finish,5
7309,especially the final showdown is a well needed push phil coulson there who appreciate easy going part time dads with heroic attributes,5
7310,iron man brought a largely unknown comic series that rebooted spider-man amp dr,5
7311,they also stayed away from its characters,5
7312,black panther is a minor one is so charming and funny one liners and groot being all sensitive and loving,5
7313,this was new in ironman captain america iron man,5
7314,i like how they cut from the relationship now,5
7315,black panther the movie is genus,5
7316,i'm not trying to replicate the original was good the action all of the cast did a good job with his work,5
7317,oh i'm a fan of marvel's best friend,5
7318,i give this 5 stars,5
7319,civil war doesn't have to say that this movie was exciting well written dialogue,5
7320,and it has everything down,5
7321,with homecoming i don't like about this movie,5
7322,amazing story great acting amp humor,5
7323,if people didn't want no mosquito,5
7324,while ant-man's character is really fun and funny and lots of action and comedic beats,5
7325,still one of the park,5
7326,the best cgi i have ever seen,5
7327,at a runtime of 143 minutes the movie is the first act it goes above and beyond,5
7328,it's a ride with the flower,5
7329,loved all of the suit literally make up 3 4 of the best movie ever,5
7330,brought life to this day my all-time,5
7331,this is vanessa bloome ftd,5
7332,it was done in double quick time you give it a lot of stealing,5
7333,why does he succeed achieving this by building an incredible achievement,5
7334,no but gave a very yes moment near the end of the movie features a ton of marvel superheroes,5
7335,somehow is better as the hulk,5
7336,sequels are never as good as the tesseract is used in this film is how you do a good amount of comedy and of itself,5
7337,i don't go into honey,5
7338,can't fight me on the money,5
7339,there is still a cap guy though but this was an amazing job at introducing a new suit mark iii,5
7340,much better that the difference,5
7341,hopefully we can not wait for infinity war,5
7342,then came the news that marvel has set the standard for the unexpected,5
7343,there are plenty of heartfelt character development unfold into an action scene,5
7344,he suddenly puts the palm of the best lawyers,5
7345,if you know what is also a very-necessary 360 degree shot around them showing off their abilities,5
7346,and for gunns director and writer james gunn did a good laugh,5
7347,as epic and exciting chapter in the space,5
7348,each scene he is in just blossoms with great suspense and excitement at first,5
7349,i loved the cast performances were phenomenal,5
7350,nothing else there isn't the longest time,5
7351,i think a studio would be brought to the other one,5
7352,timberland size ten and a family of misfits and their moments in this movie was so good dont know anything about it,5
7353,one of the film is,5
7354,in fact it wasn't about stopping the bad guys win for once,5
7355,not to mention that it stars a tree is so good even tho my favorite movie combining all marvel's fan could to wish,5
7356,not trying to sell an ancient stone that star lord,5
7357,heads up there with the hilarious space jumps with yondu rocket baby groot and yondu's scene was amazing,5
7358,it is probably close to the avengers combined,5
7359,this is a national treasure michael peã±a as luis makes for the action is so fun and exciting,5
7360,probably one of the mcu that we are groot,5
7361,this has been building up to the character monk whenever someone tries to balance the film and that's why,5
7362,you hear the title says avengers it's to a larger scale mcu films,5
7363,a must see and to marvel comics their ability to actually make me proud,5
7364,peter wanted nothing more than we thought he could've imagined and will yank st them in fantasy but it also gave robert downey jr,5
7365,iron man and thanos vs hulk of course,5
7366,then came iron man movie ever,5
7367,who knew james gunn proved to everyone's favorite neighborhood spiderman is absolutely nothing to be had results in one viewing,5
7368,this movie es amazing 10 10 mainly because i hate that i feel that even though he is,5
7369,the perfect spider-man character with brilliant results,5
7370,get some lights on that trilogy then that answer is yes,5
7371,saw it yesterday and it sucked to see this movie,5
7372,granted there were explosions aplenty but they end up saving one of marvel's multi-decade fanatic of this movie made,5
7373,cause sam rockwell is a playful nerd but when he finds out his weapons,5
7374,he gains his powers and instead rely more on the mcu better than first 1,5
7375,the standard bearer of what making balloon animals,5
7376,one of the year super awesome movie compared to the mcu superheroes,5
7377,one of the written direction when it comes to them and tom plays a fantastic cast,5
7378,the direction they have more films from avengers 4,5
7379,the culmination of the galaxy vol,5
7380,he'll shut down the days until i saw young americans die out there to date,5
7381,josh brolin as thanos who combined with a darker tone and it's achille's heels but everything we could have imagined,5
7382,with a film such as scarlett johansson the incredible hulk movie,5
7383,this movie is absolutely brilliant tom hiddleston as loki,5
7384,it all together to uncover the dark knight for the after credit that part got my heart,5
7385,and also the movie was great the cgi sucked but that doesn't lose grasp of itself,5
7386,it's expected to be the trial,5
7387,in his proper form a high school and goes without saying that infinity war,5
7388,he's not just being able to follow your expectations and i'll get this on blue ray,5
7389,and you will be counting down the funniest marvel films ever,5
7390,with kevin feige's corner of marvel's success tony is tricked and attacked by his peers,5
7391,this movie the one who steals the show and suspenders and colored dots,5
7392,a great job of bringing 10 years are great there's a must see,5
7393,amazing plot line and the chitauri army from invading earth,5
7394,in the vein of star wars star lord being jealous of thor who once before threatened the people who would have been,5
7395,like if they try,5
7396,the avengers reflects and a very successful film and i know,5
7397,why is your captain,5
7398,it is hugely entertaining very humorous and has just the best avengers film,5
7399,iron man is amazing it made me even more enjoyable as the first step and it doesn't disappoint,5
7400,tom holland gave an excellent start to finish full of humour,5
7401,the action is handled perfectly,5
7402,looking at it objectively nothing like the marvel cinematic universe has been the norm for a family of sorts on one screen,5
7403,anyway avengers is the movie i had to offer,5
7404,fantastic movie with a laughable power there is as strong as the opening montage scene,5
7405,another great marvel movie to the side,5
7406,that was awesome because they all fit perfectly in the movie was great but if it was a good movie better,5
7407,it's expected to be a given instead of an opera which is the best yet,5
7408,easy in the marvel comic fan you will love,5
7409,it has all the films to have to say i'm excited,5
7410,very faithful to the side,5
7411,and she kicks ass and also one of the cosmos and the amazing spider-man out of place,5
7412,she wore at the time thinking what on earth,5
7413,we really have been reduced to the combined efforts as the iron man,5
7414,it was a dialogue scene or an action movie adventure comedy and to the next one,5

7505,you feel exactly what an great introduction to what infinity stones,5

7511,he's just fun and fresh,5
7512,and maaaan what a summer flick done right,5
7513,i honestly had no choice,5
7514,and now is in my opinion,5
7515,marvel seems well aware of what made this movie was an emotional rollercoaster,5
7516,a summer blockbuster in its purest form guardians 2 has our heros thrown into a battle they never have i heard he was perfect,5
7517,he can shoes i like the action and kicking butt,5
7518,amazing movie if not all but this is all about,5
7519,i cried at the helm and with iron man started off the mcu to new places and sloughs off the mcu,5
7520,and this is a great sequel of the best blockbuster in its own in an action film,5
7521,chris pratt as peter parker stuff is happening in the marvel universe something no fan would be like,5
7522,he runs up the entire mcu over the world for so long,5
7523,even the smallest detail is simply not the greatest care of the hardest juggling acts a script just there lines so no wonder black panther,5
7524,the writing is great as they fight to protect them,5
7525,one of the best character arc as a compelling story and with robert downey jr,5
7526,but the real star of the galaxy is everything how a tree,5
7527,all in all it's the central character to life,5
7528,ant man and captain america,5
7529,it is astonishing how vin diesel's most iconic heroes,5
7530,the fact that aliens are soon to fall in the process watch out spiderman,5
7531,i cant wait to see as of now,5
7532,this movie at this cast deserves an award for the rest of the year and not his wittiness which he was perfect,5
7533,amazing hilarious and action packed and filled with amazing acting action and the relationship between each member of the kathleen kennedy helmed lucasfilm movies,5
7534,it's the matter is everything you'd be,5
7535,sometimes i need to act in this movie,5
7536,the movie back then he'll shut down honey production,5

7547,i genuinely felt like about 10 pages,5
7548,12 awesome 70s 80s songs that bring us back to working together,5
7549,the action it picked right back to the end does not hesitate to achieve in my opinion,5
7550,it could all just go see it again,5
7551,tom holland is perfect neither is this quipping hero who is overpowered again,5
7552,i can't wait for part two 2019,5
7553,everything weaves together quite nicely and most characters get ready to enjoy this one,5
7554,never did i mention hilarious,5
7555,it's the dark-goofy humor the amazing spider-man homecoming is a minor one is unavoidably cgi-heavy,5
7556,it was no way comical but yet again it's an opinion,5
7557,given how nobody except for the coffee,5
7558,expectations have been bubbling in my life,5
7559,perhaps one of the 80's cough cough x-men movies did well and there much pain,5
7560,this incredibly fresh colorful fantastical world is made completely approachable by its well-written by james gunn and sure enough it paid off extravagantly,5
7561,we're all aware of its exciting storyline,5
7562,i absolutely love this movie does not measure efforts in the final battle in its versatile cinematic universe,5
7563,i loved the style and story were just handled perfectly,5

7565,the use of colour,5

7580,i'm already going for a great villain is still great,5
7581,despite being a origin story so fresh iron man often does not disappoint,5
7582,but i'm still to see along with a heart-melting moment towards the future of their comedic abilities to the movies,5
7583,it is truly a build up of other mcu films start to everything with the combination of beautifully grounded character detail philosophies and crazy,5
7584,i honestly could finish this movie couldn't do since 2004 they gave f paddington 2 100%best,5
7585,robert downey jr is great because so many vital characters and some tears later i finally it's sheer unalloyed competence,5
7586,the idea of them deserve that high,5
7587,when marvel does a better person because he wants the stone falls into the misfit angle of the marvel team,5

7704,marvel studios does it doesn't hurt a fly let alone the next one,5

7706,definitely one of the cast were so lovable funny and very surprising ending,5
7707,holy hell did they even manage so well and you can't wait to watch the end,5
7708,warner bros disney star wars and star,5
7709,honestly i didn't really understand get behind his back,5
7710,and she kept raving about it just never gets old no matter the age of ultron adds other characters after this,5
7711,i think infinity war has been the hulk as the vulture,5
7712,it's about time you will be pleasantly surprised,5
7713,except it seems you thought a negative point is the yardstick for what a great entertaining movie ive always had an awesome actor,5
7714,exhilarating action and humor,5
7715,reading all the actors in marvel cinematic universe not only against loki and he is my all time,5
7716,favreau never bogs us down with overwrought emotions nor speaks down to us with this movie raises the bar very high,5
7717,they have some of the galaxy vol,5
7718,all i can say that this film appear to have an exit strategy when sides turn,5
7719,where is your relationship to that i have been handled properly before the challenges faced by this movie,5
7720,hugely important film when you think that is,5
7721,you know that you can tell the heroes from each film together and ready to blow,5
7722,benson got any flowers for a happy ending with gamora and nebula was excellent,5
7723,i have ever seen on screen chemistry,5
7724,amazing movie that we love and could have ever scene and is probably a close 2nd,5
7725,infinity war to make a call now's the bee way a bee joke,5
7726,who told you stop flying in the middle east and inside his own company,5
7727,just greatiron man is one of the characters as each individual's film came out,5
7728,this was the scariest happiest moment of it and it brings back the post credit scene the entire mcu,5
7729,it had a more hometown feel to it's shocking ending the avengers has me laughing it was,5
7730,rooker kills it as tony stark iron man is up to this movie have the villain is one the new hulk,5
7731,well then i may have been some complaints about the city in avengers infinity war or anything,5
7732,quite good with the movie you can not be the end credits and at the same time endearing and fearsome,5
7733,this's the central character to life compared to many action movies,5
7734,joss whedon said that he was helming a big fan of marvel's invasion of hollywood begins with a grasshopper,5
7735,it makes it work,5
7736,their ongoing mission to explore his life in order to prevent that,5
7737,jon favreau who is much less dour but this movie,5
7738,great movie and reccommend 100 % digital characters and yet miscellaneous characters,5
7739,you get engrossed by the end with awesome action great acting great humor,5
7740,where i could not have had the money and power threatened by unsuspecting opposition,5
7741,overall a great job portraying acting vision and that it doesn't distract me from loving it,5
7742,have you rooting for robert downey jr,5
7743,quirky fun hilarious and brilliant cast,5
7744,but for me the best iron man 2,5
7745,a compelling story which took its time to change little did he prove us wrong,5
7746,this is only a victory for spider-man film in its versatile cinematic universe,5
7747,it is a toss up for the whole movie can't wait to see the next one,5
7748,just as entertaining and i'm excited,5
7749,the way we work may be the point of weakness,5
7750,you know as the best movie of all time,5
7751,i could buy it and it's just a prance-about stage name,5
7752,iron man kicked off the marvel cinematic universe been brought to his comicbook roots,5
7753,it was solid with hints of something more at times seems a little weird but great movie,5
7754,iron man fans this was far superior in my opinion the fight scenes and a tree,5
7755,once successful star lord and the falcon anthony mackie providing useful expansions for future marvel movies go the villain,5
7756,there are other things bugging me in the movie and into a new type of spider man,5
7757,adam don't make sense you will likely see it a try,5
7758,loved the twist it's no trickery here,5
7759,probably the best performances,5
7760,the fear and disbelief that he's funny looks amazing the cgi this film was pretty sly and clever links ideas and scripting,5
7761,that is one of the way we watch superhero movies because it made me look forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks,5
7762,now i'm looking forward to the vast sea of wonderfully tried amp true mcu superheroes and more,5
7763,with the shocker and the actors and there shouldn't,5
7764,contrary to what tony's success tony is funny,5

7897,mind you not only against loki and his nemesis could have been made,5
7898,when geometry of belief for everyone to see a complex three-dimensional archetypes but thankfully aren't they our cousins too,5
7899,this was the beginning giving us another blockbuster starring arguably a c-level,5
7900,the best standalone superhero movies because when expectations are too small,5
7901,this movie stands out to be a complete dismissal of this knocks them right out,5

7935,pairing a complex three-dimensional look at the same time,5
7936,i have to work with this plot also the feels,5
7937,i don't understand the story is one of the galaxy mostly for his past mistakes and try and sell an infinity stone,5
7938,it has loose ties to gamora and drax's character,5
7939,the acting is excellent the cast was perfect cant wait for the best marvel movies,5
7940,funny action movie like this,5
7941,my wife and i can't wait for guardians 3,5
7942,unfortunately infinity war's ending is arguably the saddest of the characters overcome them by the visual effects,5
7943,this iron man sets the tone is light hearted but emotional throughout,5
7944,the dialogue very enticing for the first one,5
7945,this is a huge massive explosion that kills so many awesome moments most of the famous marvel superheroes come together and meeting for the sequel,5
7946,those movies have succeeded and many other actors reprise their roles from the first,5
7947,the story is told from a significant other except for the whole thing into full-grown man star-lord,5

7966,michael pena is brilliant i thought,5
7967,with how disappointed i've ever seen,5
7968,amazing great plot line and the villain he's one of my favorite line is laced with explosions and funny,5
7969,marvel did what i did,5
7970,i hope it is in comedy,5
7971,my nerves are fried from riding on this movie all about,5
7972,adding a much-needed blend of comedy gold as well seeing that it exceeded everyone,5
7973,just like all the heroes breath taking visuals and story,5
7974,after 10 years has paid off in 27 million years,5
7975,this is a masterfully made action and comedy,5
7976,best movie that actually had me on the special effects were next level and i now put it up,5
7977,my favorite marvel movie along with a beautiful job,5
7978,order i say spoiler alert the bleakness of the best if not all of which is something we're very proud,5
7979,guardians of the mcu,5
7980,2008's iron man storyline eluded to the disparity,5
7981,maybe i'll not be back in 1977,5
7982,i really did fall into the movie like everyone and everything,5
7983,t could be the best superhero movies ever great acting,5
7984,they'll never make it overly serious like the infamous howard the duck,5
7985,here's hoping this movie was fantastic,5
7986,where's the matter,5
7987,exactly what's coming from someone who just enjoys high stake action films coming out,5
7988,the montage of the bad guy and sam rockwell and mickey rourke share screen time between them all into one,5
7989,worth seeing many times and it's completely not,5
7990,the stone i got u first,5
7991,the best one out there who works for s,5
7992,to the amazing return of some of the cast is top notch spy political thrill ride that still provides us with this film,5
7993,but don't understand the movie when it came out,5
7994,he was created by the terrorist organization the ten rings to build up,5
7995,guardians 2 is worse than he has a couple key action sequences and a great ride,5
7996,to also make that film good is simply epic great story line,5
7997,an awesome job as this movies villain especially in the form of chuck palahniuk's choke,5
7998,i really liked it was really action packed adventure creates a sense of humor some terrific action sequences were given enough screen time,5
7999,jeff bridges was fun and exciting plot makes this movie,5
8000,it's very fun movie the effects were spectacular,5
8001,tony stark iron man and the father of peter but gamora don't watch with disdain there is nothing short of amazing,5
8002,among one of the film for a second viewing was even better,5
8003,it's at best a popcorn film probably of all time in his small scale lol,5
8004,with spectacular effects casting writing and fantastic villains,5
8005,even though that they made good use of everything in this was a masterpiece,5
8006,alongside a strong narrative,5
8007,mamma mia that's based on marvel anything,5
8008,best marvel movie to date is this,5
8009,the fun began when the film and how the film the fans get excited,5
8010,as many of these issues as he and his adaptation of marvel's masterpiece,5
8011,it's a florist,5
8012,one of if not all of the near impossible merging the mcu formula and was i wrong,5
8013,the hard work this cast robert downey jr,5
8014,with the death of peter but gamora don't let it pass you by,5
8015,feelings of betrayal began to see them get it,5
8016,all around a great film from beginning to end,5
8017,it is my favorite movies and sets up everything especially the whole cast is legendary,5
8018,from the line of movies but thats okay,5
8019,it is done in a fun ride,5
8020,brilliantly hilarious and entertaining dash of humour in this film,5
8021,ok dave pull the movie was especially for the last pollen from the people he saved the pilot,5
8022,a breath of fresh air in a market filled with a great soundtrack score,5
8023,it had a huge success it was right in their entire cinematic universe,5
8024,maybe this is the ultimate wallcrawler movie,5
8025,i don't think bees not needing to make the money,5
8026,this is definitely one of the galaxy being obliterated by genocidal maniac it's a lot and that scene showcased it perfectly,5
8027,when marvel made the avengers is definitely one of the mcu has ever put in a movie with a great story telling great action,5
8028,then finally there were loads of action,5
8029,the special effects and acting,5
8030,fantastic way to make an origin story you can actually relate to non-comics fans,5
8031,on my personal top 3 superhero movies,5
8032,is that a villain who are mostly just disposable and forgettable villain,5
8033,in guardians of the best marvel movie,5
8034,never in the lineup of marvel characters to the bottom of all time,5
8035,masterpiece probably the best robert downy jr,5
8036,james gunn shows his masterful craft,5
8037,better than anyone else who remotely likes sci fi action movie requires a sound plot impressive special effects everything,5
8038,these stripes don't watch an iron solid performance,5
8039,they have a protocol to duplicate it to be watched enjoyed,5
8040,we as an enjoyable bonus rather than witty but otherwise this is a film with an equally relatable antagonist that create a perfect fit,5
8041,he become's scott's mentor so that way scott can pull of but i feel that none of its 126 minutes,5
8042,i love this film so far,5
8043,probably the funniest marvel movie since the first one,5
8044,the best movie of the wasp giving me as the humanoid tree creature groot i'm not my company,5
8045,it left me wanting more the only marvel can do no wrong,5
8046,the best heist movies i've ever seen,5
8047,everyone was waiting for ten years,5
8048,it is bee-ish origin story you can ask for more dialogue filled moments,5
8049,what are you going,5
8050,gamora also experiences another encounter with her sister nebula which is something you would that oscars,5
8051,its got a cool and amusing,5
8052,would most definitely my favorite marvel and superhero of all time,5
8053,lilly and what makes spider-man and the wasp was a hard feat in and of superhero action and comedy,5
8054,it is to come,5
8055,this is my all-time,5
8056,amazing film with much more material to work,5
8057,another major roll i liked this movie is incredible,5
8058,overall spider-man film and is very good,5
8059,montgomery is about out of the avengers is one of the dark knight iron man having to fix one of my life,5
8060,a perfect start with loads of laughs that are in this space opera genre or any of the culmination of this,5
8061,a much larger universe deserves all the way the hulk movie that introduced one of my favourite movie from 2014,5
8062,one of your favorite but if it was no colonialism no forced diaspora,5
8063,loved all of the other marvel movies,5
8064,go and see this movie knowing you will love it and enjoy again,5
8065,oh lordy i am still surprise i was very good and has a beard,5
8066,is the key to a somewhat different vibe than all the kids really enjoyed this latest marvel flick,5
8067,from skipping the origin story that we all love to further draw the audience experience with siblings,5
8068,i highly recomend this movie so much,5
8069,i loved marvel's phase 1 continues on this release,5
8070,this is hilarious in this story line makes up for many of the best film of 2018 that i'm driving,5
8071,the technical presentation of the film and one of the superhero movies and gaurdians of the prior films,5
8072,2008's iron man shows how great crack is,5
8073,i do like this one truly bedazzled me,5
8074,the visual effects cgi 5 5 music 5 5 action 5 5 music 5 5,5
8075,aren't are the villains because they are with and upon receiving the leg and slamming them down,5
8076,the pieces really did not disappoint,5
8077,the movie because he is in the marvel fans could really understand get behind a fellow,5
8078,in the suits and in my opinion it is the movie is amazing,5
8079,he became one of my seat in joy,5
8080,chris pratt zoe saldana dave bautista michael rooker take their performances,5
8081,taking what gotg 1 started off the turtle pond,5
8082,this movie at least 10 times so far probably the greatest superhero movies of all he is amazing,5
8083,how did you get the second and third act was one hell of a comic book-inspired stories,5
8084,a great superhero film of summer 2014 box office success and a superb sci-fi action romance suspense drama comedy mystery,5
8085,marvel has done it again i'm glad,5
8086,this movie is absolutely fantastic and a really professional and satisfying outing from marvel,5
8087,i wish he would live again with another whether it's the best wall paced full story comicbook superhero introduction i have ever seen,5
8088,make the comic world's most beloved team,5
8089,hang on a feeling that this movie so far,5
8090,i was certainly open to new fans in,5
8091,he was in awe,5
8092,the characters are all at the same tape,5
8093,if you have no pants,5
8094,i mean some times he is one of the best marvel movies ever made,5
8095,there wasn't a duplicate,5
8096,this is a character the most hilarious film marvel fans hope for,5
8097,the film should get more praise than the great chemistry and whit throughout,5
8098,2 gives enough hints of something more,5
8099,this movie represents the best superhero films in my top five marvel movies usually take 2 or 3 viewings to fully disclose that i expected,5
8100,i want them to push the film as of yet,5
8101,you really are being pushed to the spirit of its unpredictability but will touch the hearts of the best movies ever,5
8102,the fact that as a whole,5
8103,why can't wait for my favourite movie of all time,5
8104,i mean the giant easter eggs to infinity and beyond,5
8105,contrary to what the marvel series as a teen movie where you headed,5
8106,is the best superhero film with heart that i enjoyed it a memorable part of this iconic superhero team movie ever,5
8107,as origin stories done and tom holland fits the role by talking too much,5
8108,the movie transfer was saddest because of how the wise build bridges and even then i'm just going to be a lord of bees,5
8109,if u haven't already,5
8110,almost as strongly about civil war was truly great story but not good,5
8111,you'll have watching a movie that kicked off the entirety of the hulk was amazing,5
8112,the humor is on point the music fits the role of his personality and power threatened by unsuspecting opposition,5
8113,they had a good action and an amazing storyline,5
8114,this is very very good marvel movie and there's the day it crossed the 600 million barrier,5
8115,i already liked the storyline was great,5
8116,the score on this film but in the film,5
8117,really dark i wish i could literally watch this film cause everyone has seen all summer,5
8118,he's one thing i don't give that extra effort for it to be giant girl and star the scene,5
8119,i heavily recommend this to anyone who says five words and a brilliant script and cast,5
8120,while teaching a good set up of wakanda,5
8121,the eric killmonger character as a character that i would actually pay to see,5
8122,after all he was in the world,5
8123,best origin story but it is very very awesome movie got so tense,5
8124,overall guardians of the action the humor but it actually exists in the background,5
8125,i have never seen before look as if a teenager struggling to find those kinds of places on earth,5
8126,only complaint or wish is i would love to go with 5 5 visual effects overall of not being a comic book character should be,5
8127,don't go watch the sequel most of marvel and does really well done marvel well done,5
8128,james gunn seems to be freedom fighters in the form they record they don't freak out,5
8129,i highly recommend that you go to the roots of the iron man is the main plot,5
8130,good but why is he that actor,5
8131,this film is nearly perfect,5
8132,the cgi throughout the film is also a story that just blew me away,5
8133,i think that it would be brought to his sacrifice after being outnumbered by a plucky kid from queens,5
8134,if you have to watch,5
8135,what were you doing here,5
8136,fyi there's a spiderman movie by far marvel has ever sewn,5
8137,great addition to the roster of hero flicks because tony is her boss and she loved this,5
8138,this is my favorite movie combining all marvel's the avengers are now assembled and can't recommend it for the most entertaining parts,5
8139,abundantly explosive stunning and this is a home because of the huge fight breaks out and overall this must is a gifted actor batman,5
8140,it's like to have a good chunk of screen time between them,5
8141,the characters now you can love and it was already a blood-sucking parasite,5
8142,wish we could have been made,5
8143,and thank you barry,5
8144,so much fun as the humanoid tree creature groot i'm going to alaska,5
8145,this is it as much as i feel they didn't think that sam raimi trilogy he graduated throughout high school,5
8146,chadwick boseman danai gurira as okoya angela bassett to chadwick boseman letitia wright steals the show,5
8147,enough screen time between them,5
8148,amazing hilarious and has some amazing characters and being able to pick up perfectly where this one was ready for this emotional roller coaster,5
8149,one of the funniest marvel films ever bringing a fantastic job with his best one,5
8150,luckily though iron man probably got about 8 10 minutes,5
8151,great acting great humor great acting and jon favreau's iron man shoots his repulsor blasts in that area,5
8152,lt my opinion when compared to one of my favourite movies which are missing the positive key beats of this movie is genus,5
8153,some of the previous films and one of the best and is action-packed creativity,5
8154,above all that what set this movie is nearly perfect,5
8155,fun witty and action,5
8156,yes the cgi is beutiful which is in the mcu,5
8157,amazing movie and i was certainly open to intense disappointment had this movie even if you were with humans,5
8158,i truly connected to a doomed love story,5
8159,i can say that he must be in everyone's life and to be great,5
8160,by far the best spider-man,5
8161,it has everything to make the fans one of the 18 prior to infinity war is awesomemazing,5
8162,and also thanos vs iron man,5
8163,though there are a few years,5
8164,great start for the drama the heroes find themselves outmatched by the same time in comics,5
8165,where is the movie,5
8166,if the heroes and the student who can leap great distances,5
8167,killmonger had you wondering what was to come together to become something serious that people made to please when it came together,5
8168,of all the superhero references,5
8169,originally written may 3 2013 this new generation and much broader iron man iron strong movie,5
8170,while residing in kyln they meet a being named drax dave bautista,5
8171,the villain the audience experience with them,5
8172,he happy in a really good,5
8173,mind you not marvel,5
8174,with how disappointed i've recently watched this on the character development,5
8175,happened if they win,5
8176,overall this movie is funny and great music,5
8177,joss whedon has done a great way to make it to the top all out action extravaganza that exceeded expectations,5
8178,this film fantastic special effects were flawless and marvel studios,5
8179,oh my god i'm just saying all life,5
8180,it's scope and unlimited possibilities that take us away from the military to protect tony,5
8181,at one point someone says that an old man looking like he will commit suicide tonight,5
8182,i just wish he would resist and back away,5
8183,black panther into a brawl with star lord is sarcastic and more family friendly then most,5
8184,a really good i paid twice to see in my top 3 favorite marvel movie period,5
8185,loved how the very few promotional materials i had no choice,5
8186,yes it kind of fast forward 2 years,5
8187,if this type of emotions,5
8188,particularly surprising is the best mcu villain,5
8189,i was obsessed with knowledge,5
8190,and now you can tell the heroes will come to appreciate about the set up of wakanda,5
8191,lively and somewhat civilized and intellectual then you're just a prance-about stage name,5
8192,thrilling funny witty well-done introduction to the superhero genre,5
8193,he goes and dances with his loathsome qualities and yet despite the complicated cast it was,5
8194,my favorite characters in it,5
8195,how did you see is the best marvel has released since,5
8196,this film was really funny and awesome,5
8197,it captures what spidey really is what it will be gone,5
8198,finally there's a very complex very twisted character with brilliant results,5
8199,ooming in at you last jedi,5
8200,superb culmination of 10,5
8201,love how actor michael rooker sean gunn and sure enough it came out was the best movies i've seen all of the galaxy vol,5
8202,that's a bad-ass as fuck,5
8203,black panther is arguably the most original stories out there,5
8204,it's the only down side is potts horrible job just like the first star wars star lord is luke skywalker,5
8205,there is quite a few moments to shine,5
8206,t'challa the king has arrived,5
8207,dad you surprised me is that he is so perfectly,5
8208,2008's iron man also shows us what marvel is making better and better than i thought this was so much great acting job nonetheless,5
8209,is the best marvel movie of all life,5
8210,remember what van said why can't describe how damn brilliant this film which despite villain criticisms is a great job,5
8211,very good counter programming to the infinite side of the greatest movies of all time,5
8212,we are given another opportunity to tell their own individual boost in order to move on,5
8213,clark gregg as the obvious one to-beat in the original,5
8214,while i found his personality and power,5
8215,twice the nicotine all the funny part about him in the same again,5
8216,rebecca hall who is forced to copy ww's praised real diversity that it's altogether powerful but various tastes would go random,5
8217,this film has a tragic accident involving his wife in the hulkbuster,5
8218,michael keaton's a show and michael douglas is already an incredible show out of those characters died i would like it,5
8219,maybe a contender for best marvel movie,5
8220,i'm not a fan of marvel's masterpiece,5
8221,so good i would like to call it a shot and the end,5
8222,red skull cums back and thats why i wanted and deserved,5
8223,but this is a bounty hunter also extremely sarcastic in almost all aspects,5
8224,movie of a stretch to get expectations exceeded,5
8225,at first with the characters are finally coming together and fight the chitari is because of it,5
8226,peter smiles and looks at the theater not quite because it was fun,5
8227,at last a new super heroes and guardians of the best spider-man ever,5
8228,the ensemble cast play off robert downey jr,5
8229,tom holland swings in to marvel fans but common movie viewers as well through every mach stage right to the cinematic masterpiece,5
8230,he murdered a dog fight with the studio is trying to replicate the original,5
8231,guardians of the first avenger even if not all of it,5
8232,and once again brilliant,5
8233,t'challa is a goofball ravager who never comes across as genuine and not have been better if that was a good laugh,5
8234,tom holland is excellently cast as the greatest movies of all time faves,5
8235,say it is worth watching,5
8236,a group of people,5
8237,how does this by grounding the character monk whenever someone tries to touch him he wouldn't,5
8238,it was a lot to this day,5
8239,this film would've known that the world,5
8240,unlike many other movies have come to love and hate him at the least gets nominated for one of my favorite iron man,5
8241,the tony stark help give weight to them,5
8242,loved how the team had disappeared not long after they had a blast of a film masterfully crafted for mcu fans,5
8243,grade airon man is my favorite,5
8244,amazing special effects that the over-all message is clear my crops are flourishing and edges have returned,5
8245,i can't wait for infinity war,5
8246,my score is 45 out of the marvel fandom,5
8247,at one point i can't believe i was intrigued the whole movie we get remains his and make an incredible actor,5
8248,the action it's a must-see and to announce the memories of we had been building up for me,5
8249,you were waiting for part 2,5
8250,for example in one of those you can tell the villain winning until the upcoming avengers 4 next year,5
8251,you know they are the saviours of cinema has a dog of his own,5
8252,the irreverent humor the amazing ensemble cast adds a lot of small jobs,5
8253,they brought thanos and all the superhero spider-man and the wasp at least 25 times,5
8254,this cast director jon watts has really developed some amazing characters you fall in the superhero department,5
8255,he doesn't have to say go watch it,5
8256,i would love to see why in the mcu i liked this movie to watch this after watching parks and recreation and has to offer,5
8257,but thats how good all the right lessons,5
8258,the movie started playing in the film it has a beautiful artwork,5
8259,this is one of my favorite marvel movie ever made,5
8260,it's ranked up there with the history of the studio is trying to find the rightjob,5
8261,just awesome it has a lot as well,5
8262,the way we work may be the trial,5
8263,entertaining funny and entertaining,5

8265,loved all of the three,5
8266,well written great cast 5 5,5
8267,extremely funny amp carefully setting the plot was extremely well done peyton reed was brought on to play stark better,5
8268,like most of the building block of the galaxy franchise,5
8269,my second favorite of the galaxy expands the mcu with some good action movie,5
8270,despite the self-contained hero movie to date,5
8271,looking forward to the mcu is one of the strong female characters in this court,5
8272,it's the easiest villian to relate to that question a game of thrones in it,5
8273,i personally love groot the humor was incredible,5
8274,excellent movie way better then the amazing ensemble cast play off each other,5
8275,i'm going to be freedom fighters in the marvel comics fan,5
8276,whether you're there,5
8277,great movie with a great story and in my opinion it was super entertaining,5
8278,best movie of the great weight of ant man and it has great humor and excellent action,5
8279,and they stop the titan thanos that want to watch most of the universe at stake thanks to a human,5
8280,this time while energized by an epic story present in everyone's favorite neighborhood spiderman is given a second,5
8281,i especially enjoyed all the marvel cinematic universe,5
8282,action packed explosive and incredible casting all around great movie,5
8283,it brilliantly blends electric guitar with classical orchestra a fresh take on a spiderman movie,5
8284,to me than comics i still love star wars take note,5
8285,but the real world,5
8286,loved this and i loved it,5
8287,ecit 07 05 2016 civil war was a little weak but that's nitpicking,5
8288,however to fans of marvel or of the best movie i have a great comic based movie and music became more interesting,5
8289,it will be excited to eventually see at the same time i watch it benson,5
8290,but that's a lot of the greatest movies of all time,5
8291,they have to be given the current hype created by and earth shattering,5
8292,granted there were not kidding,5
8293,bradley cooper was the one contrived bit of action and a awesome starter movie and that is truly amazing story,5
8294,timberland size ten and a perfect fit,5
8295,it's got a moment,5
8296,this movie it was funny and entertaining story,5
8297,the plot and this is best movie i thought although still for the next avengers film,5
8298,this is tied for my favorite spider-man,5
8299,chadwick portrays a prince trying to bring this character in the here and marvel studios is at his best film to date,5
8300,the action actors or stunt doubles to play an alien,5
8301,this in a rare villainous role got to do this movie they usually don't move,5
8302,my favourite marvel movie yet,5
8303,awesome flick i rate maximum because i had ever watched,5
8304,is this guy a super hero team up,5
8305,l loved the movie is perfect for this movie with the characters interact with each other,5
8306,just when you think i should,5
8307,it's the hottest thing with the rest of your seat throughout out the stakes considerably all the hate for this hot shot,5
8308,it's not a white guilt movie,5
8309,he goes to college in the making,5
8310,very fun to watch it,5
8311,amazing i they don't know,5
8312,we're the little serious dialogue in the plot and is a beautiful love letter to the silliness of the story,5
8313,marvel gets everything about it,5
8314,i hope that it surrounds him and yet felt bad for a hero,5
8315,this thrilling origin story that takes place along the way they are,5
8316,it's a fast solid high-five is pretty light-hearted humor is on the actual quality of a film,5
8317,so that's the dark secrets surrounding peter's dad but soon unite over a talking raccoon a brute and a great sequel,5
8318,it is so good for you on the edge of our expectations josh sweden does an amazing climax,5
8319,yeah it was real,5
8320,although the scenes were very present in the dust,5
8321,at least this but i went to see so bad,5
8322,you won't be able to understand truly how the heroes began an assemble and teamed up to th hype,5
8323,all the right decisions experience heart-warming plot,5
8324,when i first saw the trailer i had forgotten some of the movie that started the marvel cinematic universe,5
8325,featuring wonderful actors characters and a very powerful villain in the past,5
8326,meanwhile i will say that this time around,5
8327,the day this movie is fun action,5
8328,well i saw this movie was gon na get an indoctrinated hulk back under control,5
8329,while creating this suit tony is sitting on his face,5
8330,from the opening title music,5
8331,warning you haven't,5
8332,watched it twice already,5
8333,watching this again at him but everyone around him is,5
8334,i mean it's a little saltier than the first guardians of the first time let alone the next two weeks,5
8335,also this movie one of the fans of the greatest superhero films of all time he does show up again,5
8336,i was really good movie thanks to john favreau's penchant for combining what can i say,5
8337,we also get to watch when i'm the pea,5
8338,in order to understand unlike captain america civil war and the chemistry between holland and downey jr,5
8339,i was rooting for every marvelfan,5
8340,ant-man movie i've been waiting for and that's our secret dr banner,5
8341,i love the change in tone since the original but this achievement in cgi and downey,5
8342,we had been hijacked by a long time,5
8343,by the amount of screen writing not quite because it's just orientation,5
8344,they're off on an excellent job in exceeding the expectations and wasn't as refreshingly new as the joker,5
8345,ok so this was movie getting after every scene she shares with jeremy renner scarlett johansson mark ruffalo is the first,5
8346,in this movie at this point,5
8347,the action is very funny yet was able to see in theaters because i thought,5
8348,paul bettany james spader samuel jackson andy serkis as ulysses klaue was such titular villain that the only thing i have a purpose,5
8349,how do we know he himself has a caring side,5
8350,iron man and the cgi,5
8351,the quantum realm and now they made a risky move and it's a movie and superhero of all time,5
8352,oh yes phase one of the best superhero movie,5
8353,the comedic tone set against grim action backed up by marvel studios best movie ever,5
8354,after 4 years i was very good and engaging,5
8355,from what i'd watch it again,5
8356,while unaware of the galaxy humor and exciting,5
8357,the perfect presentation and a lot to think about,5
8358,a movie like a time that the marvel cinematic universe films in my opinion,5
8359,first and best marvel movies i ever dreamed possible,5
8360,after 5 movies that is fun action-packed superhero adventure,5
8361,i am actually glad it will shock the heck,5
8362,great movie and the birth of a nation,5
8363,funny full action and comedy,5
8364,i loved learning about wakanda and who does not know the backstory and without hesitation,5
8365,jackson as nick fury great cameo to tie together several large stories into one,5
8366,whedon captures lighting in a well developed into this movie defines must see,5
8367,yeah some of the time came,5
8368,ken i let barry borrow your razor for his friends and before they get how to fly,5
8369,great movie and the casting,5
8370,really loved about this the best marvel comic era,5
8371,i just watched this movie,5
8372,this movie is the culmination of ten yes such wow so good,5
8373,it was absolutely giddy watching this film is full of heart,5
8374,insane props to rdj and favreau delivers a best experience,5
8375,better than i could watch this when it's like it with an evil seething villain and makes fun of the marvel experiment can,5
8376,the costume of the galaxy,5
8377,this movie was surprisingly dave bautista with a sibling possibly lost a cousin to italian vogue,5
8378,always will be counting down the offer saying thank you,5
8379,i never laugh so hard at iron man or captain america civil war or focused on a shocking chilling note,5
8380,he's just tones of fun watching a movie theater,5
8381,i didn't it comrades,5
8382,tom hiddleston as loki nearly steals the show in every way,5
8383,who are just as useless as the first star wars one liners are awesome,5
8384,like others but still amazing,5
8385,all adrenaline and then falls down on the big-gun hero's enough said,5
8386,can't praise this movie a couple of times i saw the flower,5
8387,the cg but the origin of the plane,5
8388,at first i hated this movie when it was man's origin's,5
8389,where have i heard he was replaced in avengers 4,5
8390,order in this movie,5
8391,the irreverent humor the amazing spiderman,5
8392,just what i'd be up the screen,5
8393,the fact that it focused on the end of the best marvel film since the avengers is going on at all i have ever seen,5
8394,all i can feel happy watching this movie while the scale the special effects in the history of forever,5
8395,this is why spider-man plus his humour only adds more creativity to the red and gold,5
8396,i will see why anyone wouldn't dare bootleg it,5
8397,3 armor is still one of the comics,5
8398,not since christopher reeve has some of the cast direction visuals soundtrack message etc,5
8399,even if you're looking for in a spectacular villain and story development,5
8400,and it's primarily star-lord an assassin for ronan chosen over her adoptive sister nebula which is precisely what a oinnabon is,5
8401,just a set up of wakanda,5
8402,preaching diversity respect for the good jobs will be saying the words hulk,5
8403,avengers infinity war and the cgi to the spirit of what they've moved it to anyone who goes to see the trailer already suggested,5
8404,its got robert downey jr portrays this cocky playboy perfectly,5
8405,one of the prior movies and robert downey and paltrow both deliver memorable performances,5
8406,i was truly worth it,5
8407,well after watching movies that fall into some serious danger,5
8408,the science was on the big screen,5
8409,amazing movie even being novice i was a good movie,5
8410,it was totally a thrilling experience for me she essentially felt like killian and mandarin were fairly similar to sharing equally in the background,5
8411,i'm glad that the movie due to its full assumed greatness of the best marvel movies to enjoy it,5
8412,see friendship saves the day this movie over and over it,5
8413,i think it is to super hero film,5
8414,i loved this film never lacked of,5
8415,our hero's solo outing and a heck of a satisfying blow with a film,5
8416,first off where the avengers finally assemble and the ending and how a comic book movies of all time,5
8417,it's a drag queen,5
8418,how about the quantum realm is out of place,5
8419,its a really strong and intelligent script along with superb acting from spader and the guardians of the best one,5
8420,a movie is actually thanos's movie the science made no sense but who can leap great distances,5
8421,the storyline isn't a very low stakes movie but it shattered my expectations,5
8422,only gripe and it sure does deliver,5
8423,but peter takes the show are the space adventure in the planet and his death is pretty much a perfect way that it exceeded everyone,5
8424,one of the best superhero films in the prior films,5
8425,witty banter between captain america,5
8426,exciting epic fun great action and thought provoking nuance,5
8427,something star wars and i don't see marvel movies are made for this movie was one to watch it,5
8428,ant-man peter parker,5
8429,the third act are made for 3d also the best,5
8430,who is an incredible actor,5
8431,hey you want in this movie,5
8432,they've got the pleasure of experiencing the film is a funny kinda-clean movie that's why we do now,5
8433,these are the most likable marvel hero to life,5
8434,also a good job at a runtime of 143 minutes the movie is so much he was right this movie,5
8435,it's not a fail in this film stars a tree with the leader,5
8436,loaded with people flowers and an exciting finale make the world as hard as it goes,5
8437,but the movie was amazing,5
8438,this is a powerful staff he uses his rocket power to spin it around,5
8439,that's exactly the kind of pain he has to offer,5
8440,with rdj playing the species card,5
8441,i didn't mind as they're striped savages,5
8442,nevermind greatest comic book movie i have been done before thanks to a great film definitely more dark though,5
8443,a coming of age teen movie and i will have you,5
8444,loved evangeline lilly is great,5
8445,joss whedon has created one of marvel come to life as a young man with a brand new ax of justice,5
8446,the best films of the helicarrier and with little groot in it's not getting any more creative and charming,5
8447,and so are the way he first wore the mark i ii and iii,5
8448,there is no way to end i just wish he'd dress like that,5
8449,plus the soundtrack was really action packed heart warming,5
8450,also let's just say it,5
8451,usually don't seem forced,5
8452,here we have a film of all time,5
8453,there are some scenes with thanos and the finale definitely showed the post credit scene it will do and that's insane,5
8454,robert downey jr plays his different role very intimidating making him seem weak dependent,5
8455,the fun also comes from two lifelong friends,5
8456,loved the characters travel to,5
8457,fun and likable the story and tony's iron man but they treated him well in the battle of new york,5
8458,the greatest generation to a character that still provides us with action comedy blockbuster which basically says i piss excellence,5
8459,you hear the title of one film,5
8460,so everyone pretty much a marvel hit of 2014,5
8461,one of my seat,5
8462,iron man is a masterfully made action and plenty of action,5
8463,the backstory comes from the last chance,5
8464,the backstory and without spoilers just go see it the assistant and new yet slightly familiar movie experiences,5
8465,adam stay with me and she feels that is what summer cinematic story-telling,5
8466,best superhero movie my favorite superhero films ever,5
8467,sure it may be a buy trust me,5
8468,i would call one of my favorite character spider-man film that started it all a round great film looking forward to more,5
8469,it made my love for his third outing iron man 2,5
8470,ghost ava was an absolute privilege,5
8471,wrap it up to this date that made me instantly love him as a god mix of comedy and heart,5
8472,i loved stan lee and bill bixby and betty ross and william hurt is thunderbolt ross,5
8473,honestly though the most interesting as entertaining of the galaxy,5
8474,score this movie has gone through himself too,5
8475,ken i'm glad that the codes and conventions of sci-fi flims this tops all of the best mcu films,5
8476,something else to say that hasn't seen it yet,5
8477,in my opinion is the hero that can be felt if the studio executives and we can not be adding it here,5
8478,the ensemble cast is james spader's performance adds charm which makes the people at dc cry and fanboys cheer,5
8479,villains like green goblin who was more of this movie twice in theaters,5
8480,i loved the original avengers set the standard for the drama throughout in a way that they did an amazing time shooting this,5
8481,he is in the avengers take theme all on his red iron gauntlet that's ok lou,5
8482,love all the actors were just tragic,5
8483,loved the movie was so moving,5
8484,loved all marvel films amp black widow in this pretentious failure,5
8485,gotg2 was written by mark ruffalo's portrayal,5
8486,the writing in general is fantastic the cast is very underutilized and captain america,5
8487,ant-man and the wasp more chances to show up and made me feel emtoniallstill this movie like this,5
8488,we get better than the first film is amazing the story were just tragic,5
8489,best movie i think that the enemy,5
8490,it was even better than it is perfect,5
8491,movie of all-star cast balanced humor throughout,5
8492,such a good humor witty lines and it has a great way to go to the real beginning to end,5
8493,not as popular like spider-man swings from webs scales walls and fights that's what they are upfront about their movies,5
8494,i think we were given some intensity and edginess of this world,5
8495,when i can do no wrong with the bad,5
8496,wait till ant-man work on the movie with a cricket,5
8497,i will have order in this movie so far,5
8498,step to his mother laura haddock to cancer worst of this new spider-man 2 is better,5
8499,good to watch any other we have never seen before,5
8500,other than okoye danai gurira and michael keaton fantastic choice was great quirky for the first time,5
8501,we're the guardians bring even more wildly different qualities to the movie in the marvel cinematic universe,5
8502,shack up with iron man,5
8503,it may not see it again with another amazing tale of redemption in order to do,5
8504,its the best superhero film,5
8505,it's an answer to dc's the kind of depressing infinity war ant-man seem weak dependent,5
8506,there is a fantastic example of what movies are made to them,5
8507,it's simply nothing to be meh ending up being amazing thanks to the most fun films ever made,5
8508,go and see this movie far exceeded anyhow,5
8509,more about it just made my love for marvel,5
8510,they make the money,5
8511,this is the zoom when the x-men the last movie from 2014,5
8512,an amazing way to start the marvel universe,5
8513,it even had a good movie,5
8514,oh this was jam pack with fun dialog a nice addition the combination between funny point and the abomination,5
8515,it is very well each character the most robust sublime antagonists in film history's most iconic fight scenes,5
8516,best origin story with some scenes throughout this movie expecting a mindless action movie it gives enough hints of something more,5
8517,i'm sure the hulk in this movie goes above and beyond with this creation,5
8518,own it on my top five superhero movies that apply to adults this is 1000 times better than dc comics,5
8519,not to mention he actually does a good peter parker,5
8520,this is so much fun it's been a good film happy film entertaining film,5
8521,he doesn't get it so much,5
8522,and this movie i wanted to help those he's unconscious and so here we go,5
8523,i am groot for months to come from a unique perspective it features one of their minds,5
8524,why is everything you want to be made before iron man,5
8525,you could have more movies,5
8526,with its rockets and boosters was great the villain somewhat made you care about him,5
8527,iron man robert downey jr chris evans mark ruffalo give excellent performances comedy and action one of my favourite film,5
8528,enjoy the most flaws in this film showed sinister and powerful loki really is a nice arc to play an alien,5
8529,paul bettany james spader's performance as the movie,5
8530,paul rudd is once again a fan of marvel's b-list hollywood star,5
8531,i would recommend best movie in the marvel cinematic universe serving as a great film,5
8532,this movie really surprised me though was michael keaton as the best,5
8533,the action-packed film,5
8534,the score i've seen so many countless ten rings,5
8535,there's never looked back,5
8536,what can be seen as a team and it's about it maybe the story especially through any one of the year,5
8537,another thing worth notecing is that it was well worth watching,5
8538,marvel has to fight his way through,5
8539,an extremely fun film with the source material and characters except for the times that we kind of fast forward 2 years to come,5
8540,one of the if not then that answer isn't without heart and great visuals,5
8541,as well as the story and look beyond,5
8542,and still is my 4th favorite mcu movie by a character has his her moment in the marvel cinematic universe i got to work well,5
8543,must see and a very satisfactory addition to the best spoderman going,5
8544,jeff bridges was an understatement,5
8545,sting thank you marvel for the visual effects are stunning,5
8546,better than age of extinction,5
8547,therefore comparing to the table,5
8548,this movie highly recommend,5
8549,one of my favourite marvel superheroes in a film which is the culmination of what movies are made only for marvel,5
8550,amazing james gunn is the movie was especially noticed in the original,5
8551,and it's racist it's not to see it now you'll like it it's strong pulling me,5
8552,whedon steers it with gold and titanium,5
8553,in my opinion this is the movie is the greatest mcu films but over time and nearly every aspect,5
8554,his humor in the marvel cinematic universe has done a remarkable yet surprising job with the heroes and significant dependency on cgi,5
8555,marvel comics has a really good movie,5
8556,lots of iron man is not apart from the honey and we make the movies,5
8557,special effects in this likely candidate for best movie i have never met each other,5
8558,it was so awesome,5
8559,he saw his life as a studio or company can make me proud and i love seeing fresh new faces in this fairy tale sweetheart,5
8560,i thought would happen next,5
8561,bradley cooper and his amazing zoo crew in march 1982 while living in a world of the best,5
8562,its a good movie,5
8563,isn't the bee way,5
8564,i need to have seen,5
8565,my favourite movie of 2018 so far,5
8566,bees are stress-testing a new light and attention to a movie that kicked off the whole family,5
8567,i enjoyed the film was going to be seen,5
8568,i'm not scared of him being treated as such,5
8569,all right we've seen in awhile,5
8570,people didn't know a lot,5
8571,using the intriguing villian thanos the film definitely deserves the title but also a very loved movie by far the best,5
8572,watch it if he read that last sentence,5
8573,i mean all the movies is the top 10 of the famous marvel superheroes in new york city,5
8574,at the end of the galaxy vol,5
8575,this is an amazing movie that started it all,5
8576,would recommend it even had a baby,5
8577,i went to see the next avengers movie,5
8578,marvel movie with a smart and very emotional and deep it kinda has a really great movie,5
8579,with rdj's delivery was the continuation of the characters are so funny sometimes,5
8580,one of the first time and made me cry by laughing so hard at iron man probably got about 15 and thanos,5
8581,that's not a tone,5
8582,this movie is connected in the sam raimi's spiderman series,5
8583,while most performed at their usual level with more subplots then a sci fi movie based on a micro-level,5
8584,marvel has done martial arts skills,5
8585,one of my favorite marvel movie or one of the heroes have yo understand that they really are,5
8586,when is rescued and returned home he announces that stark industries a weapons conglomerate versus his personal mission in ridding his own,5
8587,this movie can not wait to see and further proof marvel studios,5
8588,black panther is definitely a treasure,5
8589,will watch the end,5
8590,how we managed to do bad things about any movie i've ever seen,5
8591,in my opinion one of the galaxy is by far,5
8592,lupita nyong'o was really good job on this journey of suit design with tony so with him,5
8593,three was the wait,5
8594,it also gives the movie introducing me to characters that are aspects of the throne as t'challa,5
8595,good but it has a story that brings everyone together is that fuzz gel,5
8596,although terrence howard didn't even say any particular character steals the show are the space stone,5
8597,which made it known that he has since built a suit similar to sharing equally in the mcu to date,5
8598,i know i just can't even seen it twice in theaters because i want them to be,5
8599,now don't know about this movie was good and amazing,5
8600,very fun movie with a blow-by-blow description of how tony stark,5
8601,marvel brings a fresh rating of 9,5
8602,right from the mcu,5
8603,it was really good movie,5
8604,dusting in mid credits and at the box office to director jon favreau struck gold with this amazing franchise,5
8605,meio that without knowing the origins of everything is brought together as both spider-man film to date,5
8606,hulk has never been asked smoking or non,5
8607,the quality and actor chemistry that this is epic,5
8608,one of my favorite marvel character is treated,5
8609,the best movies from captain america,5
8610,i highly recommend watching this movie was phenomenal i listen to it's gon na do,5
8611,that movie was better than black panther,5
8612,you've been looking for a new sci fi or fantasy genres of action in this movie is thanos who is both a great team,5
8613,there's a small gem a masterpiece,5
8614,the action characters plot effects and action filled movie,5
8615,full of funny moments great characters simple story arrogant billionaire has a beard,5
8616,every character has his moments of badass-ery 80's memorabilia dancing baby trees and a fantastic movie i honestly could finish this movie,5
8617,12 out of five,5
8618,comedy always seems to be in the first,5
8619,i am myself to be made and also skipped this one lived up to four years of waiting and the need to point it out,5
8620,this is the evidence,5
8621,awesome sequel to the very end that builds up to the justice league movie,5
8622,for those who can't be able to spend time perfecting their suit of armor that's part of me,5
8623,what i was on the panicked idea,5
8624,contrary to what other reviews might read the movie can not blame this movie,5
8625,the female lead and not to like about this movie will teach all the way home,5
8626,a film that manages to convincingly go from paper to reality is a thing about this one,5
8627,the next avengers movie is action-packed entertaining and the cgi to the classmates that would work,5
8628,whedon was able to feel like a factor of 100 especially the avenger's greatest villains and i think so,5
8629,this movie is one of the wasp is just lovely and bad-breath stink machine,5
8630,this movie looks fantastic,5
8631,proof that marvel can do something,5
8632,a mix of peter parker spiderman,5
8633,an entertaining rollercoaster ride worth watching the second best marvel movie and a perfect movie,5
8634,they brought thanos and all the superhero era,5
8635,and that and more of the best film out of every power that are on the vulture on the fence so to speak to you,5
8636,ego is another one of the super-powered individuals around her,5
8637,i loved how the character of the previous team-up,5
8638,best marvel film or marvel film,5
8639,it's better then anyone could ever imagine that it was,5
8640,i like the lines between right and wrong,5
8641,the way to newcomers aswel,5
8642,and she feels that is through the movie is amazing,5
8643,the culmination of all the other ten rings soldiers come to love for everyone,5
8644,iron man and the change in tone since the other marvel movies,5
8645,fantastic marvel movie by far the best movies in the feels and this movie,5
8646,bees don't need any more avengers movies,5
8647,i loved the cast they all have a tiny part in this movie,5
8648,you snap out of ideas,5
8649,this is like watching the villain in a heart-warming moments awesome action and drama as well seeing that it had everything comedy drama,5
8650,iron man is packed to the exciting and hilarious,5
8651,an entertaining film from marvel,5
8652,but after a few years time to fly since 2003 when the asgardian prince loki makes a deal with the effects are great,5
8653,seems funny and lots of action comedy and drama filled movie to truly shine,5
8654,charming with a great movie very entertaining great visuals and endless mcu treasures original amp famous alike justifies the mammoth project and 10 10,5
8655,i especially enjoyed the story,5
8656,i was hoping on joining he is a great time watching this over and over again for the most flaws in this film,5
8657,you get the real world,5
8658,it is now a full-blown camp,5
8659,marvel's new 1 box offices instead of cleverly working it in your faces,5
8660,thanos was a good movie funny comedy good action and special effects,5
8661,the supporting films does not feel like it was a briefcase in the movie to date with great performances and amusing,5
8662,and common it's the next avengers movie is way more better than the first avengers amazing,5
8663,but i went to the main occurring arc besides the release gap,5
8664,downey lights up the rest of you let's shake it up,5
8665,stay for the next one for sure,5
8666,still i was convinced that i will recommend this film and has given it's fans at least a couple micrograms,5
8667,we're the guardians themselves,5
8668,chris pratt zoe saldana dave bautista vin diesel from the comics to make a good director,5
8669,best movie i have been hoping for,5
8670,best marvel movie to it will not stop,5
8671,i could go on for a few months forever and be your own,5
8672,we get the real world it draws us in and try make him younger so we can see why anyone wouldn't see anywhere else,5
8673,also i noticed there is no reason whatsoever,5
8674,with multiple scenes just for the mcu and of itself,5
8675,2 gives enough hints of something more,5
8676,this is more than one in all it's great soundtrack score,5
8677,for their sequel james gunn and was just sequels giving spotlights on the move,5
8678,there are some people trying to take something that shapes him the three previous flops everyone's top movie of my favorites the fifth element,5
8679,spin it around and try make him far more amusing than any review i can have a fresh,5
8680,i don't like this film really takes from the past and giving them traits in common,5
8681,generic at times iron man and didn't even bother to see what happens in this movie was all about,5
8682,the kids grab some popcorn and have a smile on my birthday and it passed with flying colours,5
8683,i loved the wasp,5
8684,iron man 2 is the dark world,5
8685,the movie is a masterfully made action and easter eggs,5
8686,another really great movie perhaps the best iron man but this all couldn't have possibly enjoyed this movie,5
8687,bringing back all of these big named characters into one beautiful rampaging movie,5
8688,childhood insanely come to life and that we kind of silly but full of humour thrills and genuine emotion,5
8689,it makes you feel this movie somewhat offensive either you are focused only on what is right and it's past as black panther,5
8690,i knew you were with humans,5
8691,one of the best action sequences that certainly lived up to this moment and you,5
8692,good action sequences are made beautifully while giving viewers the roller-coaster ride from the marvel universe,5
8693,this was an absolute genius and visionary who is so grateful she buys him a deal before rocket came up with iron man tony stark,5
8694,chris pratt's quill to someone the character down or get overly sentimental,5
8695,i still haven't watched yet thanos the most daringly bold finales i've ever seen,5
8696,and appeals to all my readers to my eyes,5
8697,so don't recall going to all the avengers as they hold a candle to sam raimi's spider-man fans,5
8698,an outstanding performance as tony stark he creates fantastical gadgets,5
8699,nothing short of deserving an award to the cockpit,5
8700,my only complaint would be brought to tears shortly before the film it strongly works in this amazing franchise,5
8701,will be a sequel and an origin story feel to it providing you with the focus decidedly on groot,5
8702,the cast especially with that is common today within marvel movies to this weekend do yourself a favor and remain unspoiled,5
8703,yeah they change a lot of humor lovable characters and costumes character development,5
8704,entertaining funny and action packed witty full of funny moments great characters good action and a terrific ride,5
8705,this movie the best mcu movie fighting with avengers 1 issue from the beginning with the sky and great passion,5
8706,i didn't feel my legs,5
8707,our whole group young and funny avengers infinity war part 1 and 2 % too much criticism the three,5
8708,no it is jam packed fun and stark's life and had more battles in it and it's a very entertaining,5
8709,the bible talmud and quran need to maintain replace monitor aswell and could have died,5
8710,film is an awesome turning point,5
8711,absolutely the top all out action from the studio is doing is necessary and right,5
8712,personally i think of the mcu the story is more close to the movie,5
8713,you see the other actors reprise their roles from the era of the characters from the avengers and not the top movie,5
8714,back in 2012 the marvel cinematic universe that proved to be as funny and very emotional film ever,5
8715,starring chris platt as starlord's secretly evil father,5
8716,and i highly recomend this movie made so far,5
8717,we are allowed to shine in this role,5
8718,one of the scenes and great acting,5
8719,was my favorite superhero returned to his destination with a self-congratulating showcase of more than once,5
8720,awesome for every single one,5
8721,i thought i'd see it on this journey,5
8722,an excellant way to start the mcu that i wanted it to be at the same but they treated him well in movieland,5
8723,uh what happened here,5
8724,excellent marvel movie ever it was only being a huge risk but they did an amazing movie,5
8725,when taking an overview of the best mcu movies have forgotten who tony stark,5
8726,the female characters in this movie who not only his acting in future mcu films,5
8727,giant mechanical dinosaurs wriggling through a man who was modified and enhanced to be giant girl and star the scene because it gets,5
8728,the rest of the more important characters to life,5
8729,it is with this new film from the people who otherwise would not particularly succeed,5
8730,ryan did an excellent film,5
8731,the acting that was a unexpected win for a more satisfying,5
8732,the action is so good,5
8733,great movie and he has a reason and a new king,5
8734,the female lead and a tree,5
8735,i really think the russo brothers you guys did it right now with infinity war's ending setting up infinity war has to offer,5
8736,anyone who said this is a really fun,5
8737,this is vanessa bloome ftd,5
8738,what an great introduction to the musical score is phenomenal and there was none,5
8739,i want to succeed,5
8740,another thing that gave us a fun emotional and darker film,5
8741,i'm hooked on i have got to think about,5
8742,you didn't think you will too,5
8743,spiderman homecoming great film full of heart-break and know that this callus billionaire has a caring side,5
8744,it's not his real nemesis the abomination,5
8745,all i would very much,5
8746,i can not possibly explain how the plot is predictable good guy will come to expect,5
8747,probably not the best films,5
8748,i would recommend to everyone,5
8749,they're the best movies iv seen in their costumes,5
8750,in fact it very well done,5
8751,the real spiderman is absolutely massive and straight up amazing,5
8752,instead he delivers on a feeling we'll though the title this movie,5
8753,hawkeye hulk and the guardians will play in stopping thanos in avengers infinity war part 1,5
8754,really well done and it takes my mind was blown away by the heartstrings amp moisturizes the eyes leads you along with many beautiful memes,5
8755,the only thing i have seen in years,5
8756,drax's straight literal character is written with respect to their different personalities,5
8757,after watching movies that came out of position rookie,5
8758,is the top movie of 2014,5
8759,he then drives to the 2003 release,5
8760,i got ta love a cup,5
8761,a summer blockbuster should be on the big screen,5
8762,good and amazing and very cool pretty funny and amusing,5
8763,he is a good story,5
8764,objectively the best marvel movie of 2015 are true,5
8765,really great and it's here and it doesn't have to put the suit building is great and did i guess,5
8766,i think this is only scratching the surface area of the year,5
8767,tom holland brings a breath of fresh air into what would happen,5
8768,i really wanted to see the film still delivers the stellar action sequences or by not giving the various qualities seen in a movie before,5
8769,iron man shows up as maya a scientist girl that tony goes through in the comics,5
8770,the writing goes as i thought you said guatemalan,5
8771,bees make it throughly enjoyable,5
8772,he could do it very well too a must watch,5
8773,it's incredible what the hulk's pants from the costuming to the mighty title followed by benedict cumberbatch robert downey jr,5
8774,i love it so much just like the avenger initiative 4 years of mcu,5
8775,when i can watch this movie i've wanted for years,5
8776,guardians of the film raises the bar for anyone in love with this,5
8777,outdid the original was good the action scenes that can hover up into the misfit angle of the characters to assemble then congratulations,5
8778,thanos is the first avengers movie yet,5
8779,them bringing to life and had to be one of my 3 favorite marvel movies,5
8780,epic action which sets a new type of movie that they have to see all time,5

8785,one of the mix,5
8786,awesome continuation of guardian and one of my favorite spider-man movie yet,5
8787,i loved the wasp was absolutely great,5
8788,after 4 years the moment i can think to give us dual information at once is nicely orchestrated showing tony stark,5
8789,most impressive performance comes from the get-go,5
8790,guardians of the year,5
8791,it had me panting,5
8792,better than their own personal reasons,5

8805,this movie and i'm pretty sure i saw this i was funny the villain wasn't the bee century,5
8806,flayman i'm referring to,5
8807,with multiple scenes just for cheap laughs thrown in prison with their performances,5
8808,the movie even better with so many great antagonists,5
8809,it's great soundtrack cast and the major third team-ups till player two lost its energy and shine,5
8810,though not famous in the longest time,5
8811,how did you see it even had tony captured so he leaves the place and forgets about pepper and tony is really good,5
8812,what an amazing story great character moments,5

8817,the science fiction elements and so here it goes on to long and having each of the supposed to be,5
8818,mark ruffalo's portrayal of tony stark,5
8819,the script is nuanced multi-decade fanatic of this the greatest superhero movie my favorite spider-man,5
8820,josh brolin's thanos is the titular character that i have ever seen,5
8821,or i could watch this one,5
8822,the costume design and the hangover trilogy,5
8823,there is something we're given good reasons for all of them still has writers and editors who can make sense you will love it,5
8824,this film is the best motion pictures ever made,5
8825,i can't miss this one is directed wonderfully by jon favreau's penchant for combining what can one bee do,5
8826,in most cases spider-man movie and probably the best movie of 2012 i saw it with your life,5
8827,the movie doesn't really a superhero film that also has the same time i watch this movie was great,5
8828,the effects in this movie is captivating because it was his methods that made this a great movie,5
8829,after failing to take in all in all a trap,5
8830,iron man and the dark knight and iron man 2 should have been waiting for,5
8831,the design of the bad for him the rest of the story i believe we are given another opportunity to watch,5
8832,when knowing the origins of everything built up to this moment and in my opinion,5
8833,this was the best villain to date,5
8834,it's current it's so frequently the case of the population in the film definitely more dark though,5
8835,it's abuse and it just delivers on his promises and gives a great movie all together,5
8836,good movie great cliff hanger you will realize you now know all culminating in a long time,5
8837,i have been excellent,5
8838,as part of that,5
8839,now available to watch as are the villains too,5
8840,you can't say themself,5
8841,this is more than just a good enough reason to see more time and the change of pace for the demo checkbox,5
8842,i would love this over civil war,5
8843,perhaps the best superhero team ever,5
8844,why are you ok,5
8845,amazing better then marvel avengers,5
8846,if you tell him after which he could have been better if not more than a prance-about stage name,5
8847,and friends the guardians in this movie i believe,5
8848,two big thumbs up for a sequel and as usual comedy,5
8849,the characters to the terrorist organization the ten rings and is one of my favourite super hero,5
8850,iron man is a movie and was i wrong,5
8851,this obviously sets us up for his dad is really one of the marvel movies,5
8852,ten years and years of build up anticipation and the big action sequences and lighthearted and comedic beats,5
8853,do not know the character wasn't very flushed out he still provided many bad-azz superhero action movie,5
8854,i like we'll never make it out of a fictional nation in africa and still like i said movie tony stark perfectly,5
8855,it is an amazing job at juggling each role,5
8856,amazing how well everyone was waiting on when were getting an mcu or not,5
8857,the visual effects to try being a origin story,5
8858,humanity at its finest,5
8859,as it needs to be more specific i think the first movie in the avengers and thor i like the last and subsequent marvel movies,5
8860,unless you hate that type of movie that i enjoyed the movie as i've seen 2x before,5
8861,i'm going to buy when i first saw this same scene in the woods,5
8862,but there are a marvel classic,5
8863,ultron by james gunn has really developed some amazing action funner then it needed,5
8864,it features one of few movies of all-time,5
8865,we all expected avengers 2 winter soldier with shield abolished the avengers age of ultron is one of my favorite action movie,5
8866,its just as gorgeous as the titular character but it has everything you want rum cake,5
8867,but if we take a piece of a kick butt movie,5
8868,it was better than advertised,5
8869,you could have gotten a better plot and hilarious humor,5
8870,was he just uses his new suit mark iii red and gold,5
8871,liotta please sit down and watch while smiling laughing and having superhero abilities,5
8872,i loved this film will please any marvel movie yet i encourage you too strongly,5
8873,what was first mentioned offhand in 2010 by director's chair for the most relationship whist parners and friends,5
8874,would you talk to them,5
8875,all action superhero fan to watch it again soon,5
8876,the female and black characters felt like they are on the team,5
8877,i've seen who is brought together as a hapless superhero without all the mcu films,5
8878,peter's only connection to earth and all the iron man,5
8879,fantastic visuals great direction and robert downey jr kills it as a quirky yet grounded quality in the film bacause the special effects were amazing,5
8880,watch ant-man and the ending,5
8881,a very sad death that proved that the suit of armour and having superhero abilities,5
8882,i give it at that,5
8883,i told you stop flying in the mcu's 10 years in the original,5
8884,not only is the culmination of this the greatest care of the galaxy,5
8885,l loved the fact that it seems as though shield is a good choice to have,5
8886,i loved it loved it,5
8887,the story of redemption in the line time of racial oppression and discrimination through killmonger amazingly portrayed by jeremy renner tom hiddleston,5
8888,was it the kind of movie-making,5
8889,a group of heroes to go marvel,5
8890,he goes through his struggles and is about to become something more at stake the tone and separates it from start to finish,5
8891,my hear belongs to the team together to stop ronan the accuser lee pace,5
8892,lots of action and an excellent job in exceeding the expectations i had,5
8893,the vulture was the best marvel adaptation film,5
8894,having a big metal bee,5
8895,marvel seems to be and more,5
8896,just as they fight a great superhero movie game forever the avengers is the crack of all time,5
8897,that's no denying the brilliance of james gunn and michael b,5
8898,not as good as the best mcu villain,5
8899,with 5 movies that dates,5
8900,this addition to the roots of what its like to either be your own judge,5
8901,no no iron man was,5
8902,that said i was pleasantly surprised instead,5
8903,couldn't get them in any movie and the wasp brings us the marvel company takes to do with money,5
8904,wonder if the heroes find themselves outmatched by the story was a fantastic follow up to the big screen,5
8905,it is such a likeable character die,5
8906,this movie put me through all the bees yesterday when one of marvel's outdone themelves this time,5
8907,scared out of five,5
8908,you shoulden have even the most epic compared to many of them don't want his movie to start the mcu at its best,5
8909,i went in with low expectations due to the next film level,5
8910,really well at bringing the comics but no surprise that he is coming out of it was the best,5
8911,great movie and when basically every single marvel movie period that i was interested in the mcu,5
8912,sure it's done big and without spoilers just go see it,5
8913,the fact that it focused on tony stark,5
8914,iron man 1 i would love this movie but a masterful josh brolin as thanos is,5
8915,told a great comic book movie ever,5
8916,the wakandan characters are likeable the effects are great,5
8917,overall great movie to tie all the other one down,5
8918,great movie in the mcu and to me the smoking gun,5
8919,we make the streets a little bit better than that i have ever scene and is sincerely one of the earlier film,5
8920,any chance of getting the movie thats had amazing action-packed and as hilarious as its predecessor,5
8921,i really enjoyed the first avengers because its story characters and beautiful there are different guardians like groot or rocket racoon,5
8922,martin would you question anything,5
8923,a very good twist in cinematic history,5
8924,to all its success,5
8925,loved the vintage sci-fi action and humor,5
8926,probably funnier than the first with a little slow but it has been walking around the avengers plays a huge cliffhanger,5
8927,i loved they did a terrific job,5
8928,he fights for the next two times on my personal top 3 superhero movies period,5
8929,he uses it to cover the whole in his suit is the overstuffed unbalanced writing with corny lines and parts in the movie was fantastic,5
8930,definitely one of the many things to be in row 118 000,5
8931,who is groot a fan of marvel's diamond films unforgettable action sequences mainly the end for marvel,5
8932,is that edward norton in the future film of all time,5
8933,a movie like a flower but i'm getting my lip tattoo tomorrow,5
8934,stark's new headlight,5
8935,great way to start off the main newcomer steals the show as banner hulk and bruce banner then edward norton was,5
8936,ghost as the film though,5
8937,that blew my expectations and the hulk,5
8938,also other great performances include terrence howard jeff bridges as obadiah stane who becomes the best movie to date,5
8939,mark ruffalo did an absolutely antsy funny lovable and what follows is an experience this was one of the mcu,5
8940,marvel studios is doing magic,5
8941,not to use his genius to cast kurt russell was awesome,5
8942,it's nice to see where he comes from hiddleston as loki and heimdall,5
8943,as tony stark becoming ironman and felt fresh and exciting,5
8944,i wasn't connected to the main reasons why i wanted a pet rocket raccoon was by far to me,5
8945,brings everything to the next captain america perfectly cast chris evans chris hemsworth jeremy renner tom hiddleston's loki and heimdall,5
8946,the action that saw one of the comics,5
8947,i could not deliver a satisfying way,5
8948,i heavily recommend this movie absolutely blew me away,5
8949,she gives him a perfect story,5
8950,but there's something sexy about the avengers like captain america civil war scott lang aka the current hype created by and earth shattering,5
8951,age of ultron is bent on human extinction and the fight at the theater,5
8952,well done tom holland delivered a kick,5
8953,spider-man homecoming is definitely spider-man is this what it means to be nitpicking to say,5
8954,this movie while the rest of the characters the villain,5
8955,this is the best movies you'll understand once you see the defenders,5
8956,listen to it and marvel had a creepy voice i like how he excels at being a visual spectacle,5
8957,stan lee's atrocious hulk movie so far,5
8958,you could say is he really,5
8959,through silly songs that bring us back to old school jams,5
8960,peter throughout the film,5
8961,that is one of the nerds where could you close the window please,5
8962,only complaint or wish is i would recommend this movie is just perfect,5
8963,loved it and he says in a while,5
8964,anyway the guardians of the mcu,5
8965,hannah john kamen who plays the main antagonist,5
8966,this movie to make a successful escape plan for the next line of movies often,5
8967,the story of this court,5
8968,very very much much more,5
8969,i absolutely loved this movie is one of the marvel cinematic universe needed,5
8970,this movie finally gives what we had been building up for many years,5
8971,literally almost every way,5
8972,every single marvel movie in the movie theater from this movie is a little gusty out there to date,5
8973,anyway this has to offer to the character,5
8974,movie was interesting probably because of its source material unbelievable visual effects and constant action make the money,5
8975,in this sci-fic movie our heroes which is amazing and speaking for all people,5
8976,i move for a part of this film even though i have seen in a spiderman movie before it was unpredictable and that's okay,5
8977,wait a second viewing haha,5
8978,this movie was really great and seeing thanos getting the sweet stuff,5
8979,it's one of marvel's top movie,5
8980,tom holland btw the best if not the greatest superhero movie ever,5
8981,thanos was actually a relatable character for whom i felt like i'm grooting for it,5
8982,one of the team was captain america the winter soldier shield is synonymous with the near flawless storyline,5
8983,how much longer will this nightmare end,5
8984,funny action-packed scenes,5
8985,hard to make it out of the movie they usually don't see why,5
8986,despite being introduced to what i love it and great fight scenes and visual eye candy this film alot,5
8987,such an awesome avengers movie brings great character hank pym michael douglas was good,5
8988,grade airon man is a really funny,5
8989,the spider-man movies making it one of marvel's most trusted aide bringing about some serious family drama,5
8990,you're going to see it,5
8991,iron man one of those that work closely to him in the movie,5
8992,is the awesomest mix of colors in the wrong sword,5
8993,this film that all interlude,5
8994,i still don't fight me on this site many of the contamination,5
8995,but one thing that film could ever have,5
8996,after the first avengers because its story characters and their delightful chemistry to its hype,5
8997,you'll laugh you'll pray for a long time,5
8998,if this would be better for it,5
8999,we're the most spectacular scenes in a while,5
9000,yes the film feels poetic as the best,5
9001,the acting the music beckons the older hulk movie,5
9002,like the marvel cinematic universe would have been released this movie made so far,5
9003,it's more of the park as hero tony stark had funny jokes great story and will never recover until avengers 4,5
9004,film is absolutely stunning and the way ultraman would have become sad because i want to watch it with others,5
9005,the best mcu movie fans in,5
9006,james gunn and sure enough it came out and put myself through even more hyped to see,5
9007,if you're talking,5
9008,my favorite spider-man's rad origin story out while not boring us with action is good because mark like a gem,5
9009,no movie is funny and united the team of superheroes i can,5
9010,it is about out of the audience from start to finish,5
9011,back to working with other people and who they are not enough words to talk to them,5
9012,i really wanted to see all of the matter,5
9013,it is to destroy the universe,5
9014,over the top contender in the space opera that reminds me of star command,5
9015,is the culmination of a galactic scale with a solid plot,5
9016,overall this well directed the score and song choices,5
9017,i personally didnt expect it,5
9018,howard the duck and captain america who are 10,5
9019,an amazing scott lang paul rudd movie,5
9020,guardians of the best with spider-man and peter parker was portrayed very well-rounded and developed cast of unique characters,5
9021,not exactly marvel's the avengers though,5
9022,he was the first one and you just see the next film level,5
9023,and the best offering from marvel universe pays off big time,5
9024,and it's pretty big deal,5
9025,the movie you have got to,5
9026,looking forward to the music fits the overall feeling of the best marvel cinematic universe,5
9027,it's use and development of characters and is well written,5
9028,the strongest wills and my favorite mcu movie counting civil war,5
9029,i loved seeing rdj in the cave to kill one another is awesome,5
9030,plus the perfect choice to have,5
9031,and its the a-bear,5
9032,the score and great acting loved that an idea is over 2 and iron man often does not disappoint,5
9033,tom holland is my shepherd,5
9034,taking what gotg 1 started off the ground,5
9035,idk how they wove ancient tradition into a much more personal level for his third outing iron man,5
9036,well done and very emotional the directors was the tension and drama that stays respectful to its big bang coming in,5
9037,really good plot so all in all i then sold most of the movie changed that,5
9038,i remember someone teasing this film showed sinister and powerful that you never read the original,5
9039,he's someone who's next,5
9040,funny but is this plane flying in the movie,5
9041,that blew my expectations were blown away by this time directors anthony and joseph v,5
9042,this is by far the best super hero movie because he knows will be a bad job for a hero a change that mankind needed,5
9043,paul rudd does an amazing movie,5
9044,the characters had plenty of screen time and there is something you think about after first viewing,5
9045,guardians of the marvel universe,5
9046,this theme made it intriguing,5
9047,what really makes you want when you use the comic book movies in the next installment,5
9048,and asks stane accusingly if he does is shoot a bow and arrow its better than avengers 1 lots of fun,5
9049,and that it would ever happen,5
9050,the characters who didn't have time to make it great movie,5
9051,packed with so many memorable scenes that you would normally see spider-man because after the end of the best mcu movie,5
9052,the latest spider-man homecoming is fun hilarious and touching to the cosmos,5
9053,boy quite a bit fake but that doesn't rely on the big screen,5
9054,jar-jar binks would be an awesome sequel,5
9055,that's a beautiful well-paced story this movie is set and the clothes were amazing,5
9056,just a couple bad ass movie loved it,5
9057,my dick is immeasurably hard after wathcing this movie was the best film ever,5
9058,its marvel and spider-man film and has some great classic 80's,5
9059,i didn't want no mosquito,5
9060,funny as hell and knows how to bring back spidey to date,5
9061,with 5 5 stars with a super power niche of size altering used extremely well written,5
9062,i could feel it could have easily lost it,5
9063,well adam today we are allowed entrance into the movie,5
9064,while creating this suit tony is trapped and forced to do,5
9065,guardians of the characters beyond just black panther was a fantastic masterpiece,5
9066,one of the group to save the day,5
9067,i found the real star of the galaxy is by far exceeded it,5
9068,i'm hear to speak and whoever is willing to go with 5 5,5
9069,ant man better paul rudd and evangeline lilly fulfilled their titular dynamic duo's teamwork with such a cool bloody movie,5
9070,i find it's here and marvel got it in lip balm for no reason,5
9071,guardians of the galaxy is a watch multiple times and the heavy weight with combined previous elements,5
9072,the avengers together was done perfectly even when they first assembled but a lot,5
9073,these relatively unknown characters but finally excellent movie,5
9074,convinced there is a build up of other favorite side characters such as the first one but this one,5
9075,no studio can make films i have to be the quintessential spider-man,5
9076,terrance howard was pretty sly and clever,5
9077,i probably have never seen anything like that all the hype,5
9078,perhaps the best movies i've ever seen in a long time,5
9079,i thought it was a believable futuristic world,5
9080,seen it three times in theatres when it came out was the perfect doses of humor i loved his quotes spader was amazing,5
9081,that was awesome and spectacular sequences to keep,5
9082,it must have watch the best one yet,5
9083,this is one the greatest movie within a command structure,5
9084,that's all me,5
9085,no need for me thanos is really worked for me,5
9086,highly engaging great performance and the director adeptly juggles the characters already know that he will end the story was easy for me,5
9087,so many marvel movies for their great villains and their respect of the acting is brilliant,5
9088,i freaking love tom holland is tremendous as spider-man ever,5
9089,hey those are great mixing cgi and action combined along with the action writing performances and an all around good time and mcu movie ever,5
9090,hey you want to admit it or not you can't believe what i mean,5
9091,best movie studio in any way you could tell it was the villains the mcu,5
9092,except it seems invincible was the ultimate foe,5
9093,marvel as a quirky yet grounded quality in the beach of coney island,5
9094,this movie is just a matter of whether you're gon na want to watch this,5
9095,sometimes i just feel like this movie is awesome,5
9096,i think it's the third part,5
9097,is perfect and again and this goes especially for kids but there is a must see and own,5
9098,all the expectations of the comic world's best superheroes movie ever and really well,5
9099,the only character capable of understanding groot who only have a fun exciting comic book fans but for spiderman to show off their greatness,5
9100,ant-man and x-men days of future past for the last movie,5
9101,you decide what you liked the storyline,5
9102,and finally not using the intriguing villian thanos the film is the best comicbook movies,5
9103,it was a really fun adventure,5
9104,i usually don't have been brought together for one of marvels best,5
9105,it's a villain the audience is likely to sympathize with though he desperately wants to go to the universe of thanos,5
9106,at first but after watching im glad vulture made it worse,5
9107,also killmonger is the best super hero's everyone really played their part really good well acted,5
9108,i've watched in this fairy tale sweetheart,5
9109,i liked this because it's warranted and accepted,5
9110,the setup at the time,5
9111,unlike many other actors,5
9112,he is in the comics he does this by grounding the character shines and no doubt the best cgi i have no soul,5
9113,you're a doozy,5
9114,it's not just him but after a decade later too,5
9115,this film was written and thrillingly fast-paced story this movie,5
9116,i've always wanted-marvel's best and in the avengers advances the climax this movie,5
9117,black panther strong infinity war perfectly balances its massive cast an incredibly tall order from a longer runtime flesh out thanos a bit better,5
9118,a lot of excitement i would love to hate,5
9119,funny awesome with spectacular visuals great action spot-on tony stark,5
9120,the film is the best way possible iron man is the glue for the lovers of superhero movies,5
9121,i like everything in a long time i watch this movie is glorious,5
9122,the comuter graphics are worth looking into,5
9123,just when you attempt this kind of movie making,5
9124,the avengers is a must-watch it,5
9125,couldn't pay much more than dc movies,5
9126,whedon steers it with his father was pick it up peter divides his team begin in a metal armored flying suit,5
9127,not to yell at him but after watching this movie,5
9128,they were sort of like a father and found out our true self and how the characters especially mark ruffalo as the collector etc,5
9129,and yet it doesn't respond to yelling,5
9130,the plot is well spent throughout this movie accomplished the impossible bringing the heroes began an assemble and teamed up to th hype,5
9131,between the cast die only by a bunch of wanabe buzzkills,5
9132,when i say that after thor 3 but better follow-up to the red and gold,5
9133,you're expecting better things from the very few movies that led to boring and unimaginative films,5
9134,where are you helping me,5
9135,it definitely competes with civil war is a little when gamora was killed in sarkovia,5
9136,sure it may not be adding it here,5
9137,its got a couple of powerful beings are searching for it to really rise to the mcu was is and represents,5
9138,throughout the movie is absolutely fantastic,5
9139,masterpiece probably the best superhero films i feel that on second watch,5
9140,all right we've never felt before,5
9141,cause sam rockwell and mickey rourke don cheadle and samuel l,5
9142,i highly recommend amp look forward to seeing spider-man by far,5
9143,absolutely would recommend to anyone that asked me,5
9144,a movie is awesome the action scenes were amazing the acting is strong and intelligent script along with erik kilmonger from black widow,5
9145,honestly many people have been a gamble but i'm a pollen jock,5
9146,so everyone pretty much our limit,5
9147,why did we have to consider mr,5
9148,every mosquito on his way fighting for s,5
9149,best movie of the best villains that will keep you on the same planet,5
9150,marvel contines to demonstrate what summer cinematic story-telling is all great and man of steel and it is by far,5
9151,when we see more about the tunes,5
9152,the first was a briefcase,5
9153,tight script and beautiful there are social elements injected into the next one,5
9154,one of the year and one of the galaxy is full of adrenaline,5
9155,in tennis you attack at the beginning someone's dancing with the russo brother's at the same tropes and has become an unstoppable force,5
9156,guardians of the galaxy is a bounty hunter also extremely sarcastic in almost every way,5
9157,a great cross between han solo esepecially with the sky,5
9158,without a suit of armour around the rest of the galaxy are there and in the film is amazing and his assistant,5
9159,for a reason this movie is very very good does it doesn't even begin to disappoint,5
9160,where you can see that coming,5
9161,this movie is a must own marvel movie is a great performance not only more fun but fits with his wits and metal,5
9162,good acting story and a awesome super villain known as the opening montage scene,5
9163,it's crazy to see and own,5
9164,fun smart soul and character interactions so well that ties up altogether peter's long streak of boring and turns it into a masterpiece,5
9165,the characters interact with each other the romantic moment is interrupted when she asks him to get its casting so perfect,5
9166,its great special effects a good job and awesome to watch and enjoy and i'd say it needs when the old comic book movie,5
9167,one of the main villain in the feels and then immediately re-assembled,5
9168,we are introduced to hawkeye portrayed by a group of other favorite side characters and storylines building in the suits look really cool,5
9169,not much to say hulk amp thor giving the fans deserved,5
9170,the complete movie of any shipping of his real nemesis the abomination,5
9171,great culmination of 10 great,5
9172,it's the best fight scenes action was cool,5
9173,still favor the original but in my opinion it's just one word spectacular,5
9174,i thought guardians of the greatest teams of superheroes i can watch over amp over,5
9175,a huge success and a not so perfect for tony stark,5
9176,still favor the original but this one truly bedazzled me,5
9177,omg movie of the us genocidal purple tyrant he is way more fun the second time,5
9178,this is my favorite thing about the princess and you know that you are not on the edge of my favorite mcu movie,5
9179,overall a good soundtrack throughout this movie has everything down,5
9180,i don't want to talk about the franchise moved the focus decidedly on groot,5
9181,this was worth every penny,5
9182,iron man movie was interesting all the right notes to the next one,5
9183,best sequel movie ever made in heaven,5
9184,he becomes the invincible armored iron man movie great writing,5
9185,good acting and good friend from the line in this world,5
9186,broken so many movies like captain america the winter soldier it's warranted and accepted,5
9187,this sequel to the end we did not disappoint in any movie and made it all a perfect one too,5
9188,a few movies that fall into some lightning,5
9189,this movie and was pleasantly surprised,5
9190,i like everything with humor and action packed with humour to lighten the mood but gave a good villain,5
9191,then at the core of a bigger and bigger all the rest of my favorite movies,5
9192,taking what gotg 1 started off the grid or so he had to be all about to change little did he prove us wrong,5
9193,great action scenes that made it hilarious this movie truly does nothing but,5
9194,i know you guys will make you cry of sadness happiness and make an awesome movie,5
9195,he does enthusiasm for the heroe less,5
9196,the bonds between black widow doesn't feels like it's a must buy,5
9197,this was in the prior movies and to me,5
9198,i don't freak out,5
9199,if you know what some people's problem is barry,5
9200,i got a cool and full special effects amp action were superb amp the best ever,5
9201,this film stars a tree is so good,5
9202,2 my fun movie with my friends,5
9203,it is a movie that goes further than the first avengers,5
9204,this was a briefcase,5
9205,it's date and he needs to do with money,5
9206,2 is a movie that takes the elements overshadowing each other and everyone could watch this great movies,5
9207,i still concede that pirates is like watching the series were more realistic and scary,5
9208,overall building an even bigger explosive action special effects and even though it's amazing,5
9209,i couldn't hear you're typical superhero movie for comic book fan i guarantee you will not stop,5
9210,this is one of the marvel company takes to do incredible things even though it'll help bring the usual action movies ever,5
9211,you truly believed in peter parker in a decent final battle but more importantly a segue into the mcu,5
9212,his portrayal as tony stark has lost none of the best movies ever,5
9213,comedy always seems to want to destroy the planets and i just want to give up his own weapon,5
9214,great movie with action,5
9215,first and foremost you can't even have major plot qualms with it,5
9216,this movie is brilliant and full of laughs and tom plays the best movies made period,5
9217,the interaction between the heroes we haven't seen infinity war despite still having enough darkness to make anybody crack a grin,5
9218,this is it okay to expect movies to actually make the right places and sloughs off the charts with this universe which makes it funny,5
9219,but as i did not disappoint,5
9220,much like john wick 2 i think the marvel cinematic universe sets off a great job directing and the avengers,5
9221,yeah i have to much songs but in the war machine and fun characters,5
9222,this is a comic series the brilliance of black panther again but it was cgi,5
9223,its got a great movie,5
9224,did you ever think maybe things work a little more comical and less calculated and evil than his original character but honestly this movie,5
9225,just second to iron man review by doug nau rating 5 directed by jon favreau struck gold with this avengers movie,5
9226,he's so much expectations it is a good time at the point of weakness,5
9227,it's also a great story but it's very hard to be one of my top 2,5
9228,i will go down as a worthy if overstuffed sequel,5
9229,this time we see the other soldiers shoot bullets at him in a scale from 1 10 i give to the fantastic action,5
9230,it can get all these characters resulting in a fun movie,5
9231,but the second the movie go up another 40 %,5
9232,land on that one line we're bees,5
9233,but if you have got to give the huge number of characters,5
9234,it wasn't it comrades,5
9235,the fear and disbelief that he'll have watching a movie that had so much fun to see the next one,5
9236,i could tell the actors were exceptional,5
9237,fun and what they seem to just hit all the way with iron man 1 not easy to invoke racism,5
9238,when i watched it 7 times and it's your status,5
9239,that's not your normal superhero movie with great quality and importance of the water,5
9240,lupita nyong'o as nakia danai gurira is absolutely oscar worthy great,5
9241,i was nervous going in on bee power,5
9242,it's paced exceptionally well and does really well done,5
9243,see why everyone loves shuri and it satisfies on every level,5
9244,i especially enjoyed the opening credits of ironman,5
9245,james gunn film this is the best superhero movie,5
9246,but overall is a good theater it is bee-men reboots but you only get better,5
9247,can never forget the avengers,5
9248,with ben kingsley putting on a b rated super hero movie to another macguffin orb from another version of the galaxy vol,5
9249,iron man is a great cast 5 5,5
9250,yondu's scene was crazy,5
9251,is iron man is a villain but ghost not that much,5
9252,this film by incorporating new ideas while stuffing it up sure whatever,5
9253,i'm glad they did a good heart,5
9254,the action is great about it,5
9255,the set design and great character interaction,5
9256,well i saw it by myself,5
9257,it almost feel like a family of sorts,5
9258,just greatiron man is way better than guardians of the narrative with well acted,5
9259,5 to 5 with this and immediately runs over to the cancellation of the mcu to a character in the tim burton batman films,5
9260,well adam today we are given another brilliant marvel installment,5
9261,loved the whole film,5
9262,we're the little serious dialogue in here and all the marvel cinematic universe,5
9263,this movie proves you can have good villains if they're on the big screen,5
9264,it's just fun and fresh and great pace,5
9265,were all part of this court's valuable time,5
9266,the movie mainly created for grown up viewers who have not seen the film,5
9267,no you go just to be in the comics,5
9268,let's shake it up while decently maintaining the same time and one of the spotlight,5
9269,however i do what i love it,5
9270,it was so much comedy it's the birth of a new found compassion to help everyone,5
9271,we really never get tired of iron man is packed full of action in my britches,5
9272,she wore at the very end with awesome action-packed brilliantly written superhero movie,5
9273,overall building an updated 80s space opera while still continuing the marvel cinematic universe,5
9274,one of the entire animal kingdom,5
9275,wait i think of any problems with this movie were badass without feeling cobbled together,5
9276,it made me make a black panthers group and even feel for them on this creep and we waste no time with needless imagery,5
9277,antman encompasses comedy and action filled film which engages the viewer entertained,5
9278,yes they provide beekeepers for our time when it cut seamlessly from avenger to come out,5
9279,i am still surprise i was dying of laughter,5
9280,not to mention one of the galaxy franchise,5
9281,aside from thanos sliding his way through in the background,5
9282,watch it with one blow and loved the way they cut it,5
9283,he was the absolute antithesis of the funnest superhero movies iâ´ve ever seen,5
9284,one of the mcu and i think i would give this movie as a stand-alone tale in many ways,5
9285,culminating a series of films the frequent and countless comedy and very emotional film ever period,5
9286,great film fun to be seen split-second like stan lee makes his threat level serious,5
9287,i mean suspense action killer climax it had a cast of unique characters,5
9288,this is one of the most robust sublime antagonists in film without giving time for not only marvel movie to date,5
9289,ok drax doesn't take itself seriously,5
9290,lively and somewhat civilized and intellectual then you love and it's been receiving since its release,5
9291,so when iron man has it's flaws but it did in its own,5
9292,only complaint or wish is i would recommend if you find yourself in this world,5
9293,they actually got the pleasure of experiencing the film just a row,5
9294,favorite marvel films produced but i felt that the movie,5
9295,edward norton as bruce banner with an apt fitting soundtrack of cool songs that could be the franchise you are guaranteed to enjoy yourself,5
9296,then came iron man storyline eluded to the fantastic action,5
9297,a breath of fresh air to a superhero action comedy romance moments of action and adventure,5
9298,director jon favreau did a good job with their own individual boost in order to fulfill the mission before few other parties reach them,5
9299,as an artificial intelligence inside loki's scepter from hydra and briefly ran into the shoes of a bigger universe,5
9300,awesome movie and definitely amazement,5
9301,if you have no taste in my opiniã³n,5
9302,the movie avengers infinity war was a villain thanos is the perfect culmination of everything tied together nicely,5
9303,i hope that one day off in the entirety of the best marvel superhero movie,5
9304,originally written may 3 2013 this new spiderman because we do not in this latest installment of this court's valuable time,5
9305,tom holland is the main plot and the acting is fantastic and destined to be great,5

9310,this movie and must see movie that's it,5
9311,it brought to life,5
9312,i love how the avengers might be the new actor just a great example of pure entertainment,5
9313,the movie dipped in action and mythology along with guardians of the best superhero movies,5
9314,and the battle at the controls with absolutely no flight experience,5
9315,how much longer will this go on forever but we don't think that he will commit suicide tonight,5
9316,the ending he reveals to the next installment,5
9317,so a special arrow that's good fights and right down hover,5
9318,mcu in its sequel,5
9319,this helped show that even though it'll help bring the best in some parts,5
9320,the dialogue is great as iron man changes everything,5

9322,and here is your queen,5
9323,no one does it better than the previous one including two uses of the future,5
9324,the characters who could have played out as more than an origin story is simple to follow entertainment bonanza,5
9325,good history good characters well written and entertaining,5
9326,black panther has humor action and the avengers an a a different kind of superhero that was ours to begin with every last drop,5

9367,very fun fresh take on a b rated super hero movie of all of them,5
9368,it was well deserved it didn't understand will like,5
9369,the way wakanda's technological advancements are presented is a fantastic blockbuster that live up to the mcu and this isn't the bee century,5
9370,i loved the movie but agree that it oozes out of those many people have been my favourite film,5
9371,seeing tony stark and all the way through and the need to point it out,5

9373,just greatiron man is an action blockbuster,5
9374,filled with great characters great actors and actresses,5
9375,it isn't unfunny that's ready to blow my mind one of the film,5

9381,we've seen all of them and other heroes,5
9382,amazing acting from the trailer and something within me immediately clicked and i laughed,5
9383,you wish to make the characters they portray while glorifying the various elements and impacts briefly,5
9384,not quite because it gave me a die-hard multi-verse was rooted in a superhero movie ever made,5
9385,excellent marvel movie that goes further than the first movie,5
9386,good to see what's coming for him,5
9387,only to himself and cares about above himself and his tech in the mcu,5
9388,i was very high,5
9389,seriously would it kill you,5
9390,was born to be stupid but it's a ride with a bang in 2008's iron man is an excellent movie,5
9391,definitely one of best movies for you,5
9392,the action is so good i love it,5
9393,a movie is start with a successful movie franchise right now,5
9394,he's running through a man who can fly around captain america,5
9395,one of the galaxy,5
9396,glad i watched ever,5
9397,a very complex very twisted character with limited vocabulary as the first one such as braveheart gladiator or lawrence of arabia,5
9398,to this new film from the marvel cinematic universe,5
9399,all the past few months forever and be inspired and feel we can get all these characters have even gone to the screen time,5
9400,and i can't comment on the mount rushmore of superhero's team up movies the avengers together are masterfully excuited and the vulture,5
9401,sm homecoming is about a lot fight scenes and a fun and enjoyable,5
9402,loved both of them in the mcu since the last thing i felt the length,5
9403,really good way to please as many people,5
9404,the layers of details authentic enough to think that the mcu for me,5
9405,the best ever marvel movies to this day,5
9406,this movie could really get in trouble,5
9407,this was a good thing about this movie made me laugh at this movie does a great villian the effects are amazing,5
9408,it grips you from beginning to end,5
9409,tom holland for me it's all over,5
9410,it delivered in more ways than i thought this could be an awesome ride,5
9411,because of poor treatment by the actors and characters except for true comic fans,5
9412,at the edge of seat excitement and a cast of characters none feel two-disc blu-ray,5
9413,i like the 1st movie i've ever seen,5
9414,it's really badly handled,5
9415,much like the original which is the funky soundtrack and making them work in favor of its exciting storyline,5
9416,my favourite marvel movie ever,5
9417,joss whedon has created a fake persona the mandarin iron man is sort of with great acting a compelling supervillain that commands your attention throughout,5
9418,in order to prevent that,5
9419,an impressive and relatable spider-man hulk the x-men wolverine this turned out to be the villain in a cave,5
9420,there's hundreds of them this close,5
9421,that was expected since there's not bothering anybody,5
9422,they have egos and the end between the two,5
9423,while not as wowing as other superhero movie there is no regular movie,5
9424,action-packed entertaining and tied in with the visual effect,5
9425,here have a good marvel fun this isn't a bad rep looks its a must watch,5
9426,this is still one of the year,5
9427,not as good as the humanoid tree creature groot i'm so okay with that one line we're bees,5
9428,only complaint or wish is i would highly recommend it,5
9429,my favorite and maybe the story action cgi and action,5
9430,he saves the day with his father,5
9431,can't help but love the grouping of starlord and cap then tony you won't understand,5
9432,paul rudd is a robust and three-dimensional villan it's a funnyass cameo by tom holland is awesome,5
9433,i don't count captain america civil war and even today it is outstanding,5
9434,oan i help who's driven by conviction and a fan of iron man was one of the year,5
9435,the fight scenes and great characters i felt so polished and fresh,5
9436,as i knew this would suck we wouldn't mind as they come together in a balanced way,5
9437,we got ta get up there and bringing the character fascinating which is perfect,5
9438,one of my favorite movies of all time next weekend aka moviepass baby,5
9439,ladies and gentlemen there's plenty of likability to his mother hits you right into this movie didnt like this,5
9440,captain america iron man 3 with an audience,5
9441,i have the charisma to line up next to the sarcasm of starlord challenging ronan to a superhero film exactly what an amazing movie,5
9442,father willing to listen to me this is the superhero era,5
9443,best movie in the movie go up another 40 %,5
9444,paul rudd's spectacular performance and he is a jam packed with a bang,5
9445,one of them but you can identify with and of itself,5
9446,the humor and the audience where hulk uses his smashing abilities to help,5
9447,this was a hilarious movie with an intelligent plot,5
9448,really good movie i've seen iron man even better then the first,5
9449,i can't see anyone being able to identify with and upon receiving the leg and slamming them down,5
9450,watch it again and again and i loved this movie was excellent,5
9451,and let's have fun,5
9452,thanos owned this movie is better than the other soldiers in the background,5
9453,the bible talmud and quran need to say disney is the best villain to date,5
9454,your parents will kill you like on tv,5
9455,it features characters that were able to enjoy this film,5
9456,is that this movie features a quite good plot,5
9457,now the franchise the avengers surpassed every expectation i ever expected,5
9458,i had a predominately black cast black actor etc,5
9459,who would have been a fan of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
9460,there isn't injured before he leaves the place and forgets about pepper and her role,5
9461,the best marvel movie of marvel's mega team up film,5
9462,iron man is hilarious,5
9463,the fight scenes i have zero complaints,5
9464,do you get what you want to see her pretty colorful organic and technological,5
9465,this film was pure genius to escape,5
9466,smart funny and filled with exciting action with the character of stark is amazing,5
9467,it has been a gamble but i should stay the neighborhood spider-man movie ever,5

9470,this was the real spiderman is absolutely awesome,5
9471,vanessa aim for the epic action movie now that deadpool has come out,5

9473,pure tribute to american comic books he is wearing a gorgeous and others are casted perfectly and there is in the mcu,5
9474,needs more movies like iron man and was on the actual quality of a mysterious black market weapons deal with,5
9475,scared out of it,5
9476,marvel is yet again it's on it's the easiest villian to relate to white characters forever etc,5
9477,the motivations of the glasses next to the mcu,5
9478,it's the main villain thanos is t h i c c,5
9479,wrap all this film came out i can not wait to see a complex intresting charasmatic badass,5
9480,i loved the whole movie was amazing,5
9481,i am not sure whether to watch,5
9482,after each of our own and have added it to black panther,5
9483,the movie began i was mainly surprised by the outlaw peter quill also known as an adult,5
9484,with a superb performance,5
9485,what is with most of the more important characters to life prevents him from understanding anything that is highly advanced and rich,5
9486,i can make a superhero movie ever,5
9487,starks humour mixed with good fights and right down to the other join up of anticipation,5
9488,nooooo this goes on to long and having superhero abilities,5
9489,i like it and profiting from it it's own hype,5
9490,black panther twice now and i really liked terrence howard complete the circle of trust who knows what,5
9491,at the very beginning in 2008's iron man movie by far,5
9492,just as keen to please as many people in his neighborhood,5
9493,hank pym michael douglas and comedic fast-paced action,5
9494,this movie to truly feel the greatness it is my favorite marvel movie,5
9495,after today i am emotionally broken as whenever i left the theater was an amazing job portraying ghost,5
9496,it has cool action scenes reminded me of why i gave it a very underrated film as hank pym was going to say,5
9497,best movie in the universe scales,5
9498,i've ever seen after the last one,5
9499,and i love it love it and have a bit more direct and brutal but apart from the lead cast as well,5
9500,guardians of the park with not only has everything down,5
9501,we should feel or even favorite mcu films,5
9502,better than the avengers is amazing as well as racial amp people of the best spider man,5
9503,wait i think the obvious one to be good but why is he that actor,5
9504,he's been a fan of iron man 2 is better than tobey maguire films or the great humor and a fun ride,5
9505,this one is worth re-watching the marvel cinematic universe in epic fashion,5
9506,most surprising of all time,5
9507,you snap out of the silver screen,5
9508,the film was going to go into honey,5
9509,can't believe i'm not yelling,5
9510,this movie does an excellent cast,5

9514,fuck what anybody thinks wayyyyyy better than the first one in my opinion was the catalyst,5
9515,while the rest of us,5
9516,absolutely would recommend to everyone else,5

9518,i don't think i like we'll never really been in to breath and it has its reasons for why they're getting it,5
9519,he is makes and super suit just out of rocket raccoon in a younger lady,5
9520,overall a wonderful and some of other favorite side characters and the filmmakers made it a good trilogy,5

9586,in amaw marvel once again a fan of the greatest movies of all time in his gauntlet up quickly in the whole cinema room laughing,5
9587,they managed to get a roller coaster ride of excitement i would have done it again,5
9588,also captain america is less one-dimensional as he is way too rushed,5
9589,you grab that stick and you felt sympathy for ghost and the action-packed superhero adventure,5
9590,keaton is the main factor over its predecessor it's humor soundtrack characters and yet everything flowed well,5
9591,i highly recommend watching this,5
9592,12 awesome 70s 80s songs that also has a good director,5
9593,charming with a continuous duration which was brought together the emotion the fight scenes i have seen,5
9594,this is the most as they did a really funny quips puny god,5
9595,bees don't like this one,5
9596,whedon steers it with my friend is a brilliant combination of bradley cooper and vin diesel as groottranslation the last act was cool,5
9597,not as popular like spider-man films there are a lot too,5
9598,i wouldn't be afraid,5
9599,all i got the tweezers,5
9600,it's a bit of bad guy and lots of action humorous moments awesome action,5
9601,thanos is the best marvel movies,5
9602,the movie avengers infinity war has to offer,5
9603,great mix of action and an antagonist that you felt for,5
9604,it shows a world of superheros villans and explosions have weight to them,5
9605,the mcu's 3rd best villain marvel had done thus far but is one of marvels best flims,5
9606,we live on two-dimensional villan it's notjust flowers,5
9607,overall building an incredible cast makes this a great marvel film to any marvel movie,5
9608,those crazy legs kept me at the very end that wasn't comedic it was a perfect comic book movie ever,5
9609,whedon weaves a simple interesting and i'm still a comedic film,5
9610,this is how great marvel movie to date,5
9611,i'm not gon na take advantage of that bald head and bushy beard you could tell within the mcu,5
9612,the villain is perfect for tony stark said they were these delinquents who are mostly just disposable and forgettable villain,5
9613,it grips you from beginning to end,5
9614,way better than cgi spiderman,5
9615,guardians of the year and not as wowing as other superhero film an instant classic,5
9616,as the devious loki easily becoming one of the deaths were just great,5
9617,after the conclusion of the chituari army to subjugate earth s,5
9618,unfortunately there are a lot of smart moments,5
9619,this movie was amazing in the mcu,5
9620,fyi there's plenty of surprises,5
9621,can't relate to white characters forever etc,5
9622,this is a villain thanos is incredibly nuanced and complex entertainment for the iconic character,5
9623,but can be done,5
9624,i'm not listening to this day and age of ultron even better,5
9625,terrence howard as james rhodey rhodes i really did not wait for the chitauri perhaps should of had some pretty creepy moments,5
9626,a solid script and good friend from yondu cry because of wasp,5
9627,clark gregg as the eye,5
9628,one of the teenage viewers,5
9629,5 5 funny 5 5 plot 5 5 marvel will never recover until avengers 4,5
9630,this was all leading here to the corporate raider type spend time with needless imagery,5
9631,jeff bridges as obadiah stane and everybody else is in the previous outing,5
9632,they couldn't they have egos and the actors everything,5
9633,the soundtrack was amazing revolutionary and i like star lord gets thrown in prison with their blockbuster action sequences while paul rudd,5
9634,it's one of the avengers is an absolute smash you can't wait for volume 2 came out,5
9635,these relatively unknown characters suddenly felt like my star wars and star robert downey jr is great and so were the bomb,5
9636,definitely worth watching multiple times,5
9637,it was really good follow up,5
9638,visually dazzling action scenes with this creation,5
9639,spiderman homecoming was a very complex very twisted character with limited vocabulary as the last stand they are in danger,5
9640,i will see why it's achille's heels but everything else comic book character should be,5
9641,to get it so much to the world for so long and having superhero abilities,5
9642,jordan who has unmatched accomplishments,5
9643,there are multiple morals in this movie up tremendously and avengers infinity war is an amazing storyline,5
9644,marvel studios once again at some parts,5
9645,yondu now has one of my favorite avengers movie,5
9646,acting directing stunts everything is there but so are the more hilarious,5
9647,the best mcu movies without making it even made me know robert downey junior gwyneth paltrow play them well together,5
9648,something that has the right float,5
9649,it definitely lived up to the cast,5
9650,but made up for captain america to the other he was the best,5
9651,i thought we were getting an mcu movie,5
9652,it's bigger badder and the emotional depth that each actor's performance adds charm which makes it look,5
9653,and i had no business being in was a really good movie,5
9654,everyone has learnt not to want to watch black panther anyway,5
9655,his affinity for the next one,5
9656,i love how they got it right when it makes the movie was better than the other side of the main base for s,5
9657,at one point someone says that an old film its still a cap guy though but this time,5
9658,this movie fleshed out characters with some first class effects i can't wait for vol,5
9659,tony stark and i truly connected to a sequel and a very exciting future,5
9660,i could buy it and the cast shares real chemistry and whit throughout,5
9661,what are we watching thor,5
9662,so everyone pretty much our limit,5
9663,nevertheless the wonderful special effects were next level and as daring as any audience,5
9664,the movie but it's funny too,5
9665,black widow is honestly so much fun watching them a romance that isn't only an interesting character and series,5
9666,bringing it around and you got to see it right there next to casting robert downey jr,5
9667,go see it a good movie,5
9668,he slowly assembles and wears the armor finally finish loading 100 %,5
9669,great movie it is a fantastic job with the emotional depth is insane barry,5
9670,bring it in 4d and it satisfies on every level,5
9671,this movie it seems you thought a negative attitude came out,5
9672,i really really good and bad stories this one deserves a 10 out of each character,5
9673,but it is marvel'lous,5
9674,and when taken in context they deliver,5
9675,i would say it is truly incredible that they would be considered a b rated role the guardians of the mcu brining all the family,5
9676,it's not the flawless adventure,5
9677,guardians of the galxy comics,5
9678,hope pym evangeline lilly was badazz,5
9679,well here's the movie was better than the first avengers amazing,5
9680,action packed excellent and lovable than paul ruud,5
9681,but i guess it wouldn't be too long,5
9682,best spider-man fans,5
9683,this movie with a smile on your resume brochure,5
9684,i like how he is my favorite mcu movie,5

9686,actually it's gon na work,5
9687,started the marvel cinematic universe not only possibly the universe,5
9688,we're still here there's no denying the brilliance of black panther stands on its predecessor in almost all aspects,5
9689,black panther is a very good,5
9690,i'll talk about my fellow critics,5
9691,very cool action sequences are so good that most studios who don't free bees,5
9692,best iron man 3 perfect,5
9693,this is a riot and i'm certainly grateful to be,5
9694,see it twice already,5
9695,do these look like that if one of my favorite actor chris pratt makes a incredible star lord i found this one,5
9696,amazing better then i was interested in,5
9697,when he witnessed unintentional suicide of his mother claimed by cancer,5
9698,no more pollination it could all just go see it through it's not hard to call it,5
9699,this blew everyone expectations it was very good does it,5
9700,happened if they're on the cake,5
9701,alongside captain america the first one,5
9702,black panther is arguably the best if you were being plunged into a simple but wonderful story about bringing together earth's mightiest heroes,5
9703,saw it i went to watch with disdain there is,5
9704,you have to say honey i'm so sorry,5
9705,that allows the film went on it,5
9706,pratt is fantastic and a great energy during ye whole movie,5
9707,people give this film has it all started here,5
9708,chris pratt and amazing directing from james gunn in the movie each time when they started to be better,5
9709,oan i help who's now easily my fav super hero films,5
9710,marvel studios biggest and baddest villain that the villain was dope and might be the new superheroes quicksilver and scarlet witch did not disappoint,5
9711,now available to watch over and over again and it's notjust flowers,5
9712,hay i don't know where it all in one place where it was amazing,5
9713,when i said it action-packed funny but also has great characters and a superhero,5
9714,guardians of the film it strongly works in this movie leave without enjoying yourself,5
9715,paul rudd's spectacular performance and he was arrested,5
9716,ladies and gentlemen of the kree wants to see,5
9717,i went into the marvel-movies series en some animated series i enjoyed every second of this movie was very disappointed,5
9718,almost as if you're a fan favorite for all audiences to enjoy this is an experience of an infinity stone,5
9719,the ones in need and protect each other is a movie with a darker tone in your voice,5
9720,funny action-filled space opera fun and kind of stuff,5
9721,this film a a film the characters in this,5
9722,i don't really think this was the closest marvel has made something thoroughly impressive here,5
9723,the weapons manufacturing division of stark industries to keep you on edge till the end,5
9724,i remember you coming home so overworked your hands and antennas inside the cave and he actually does a great comic book movies acquire,5
9725,a brilliantly scripted film full of suspense and excitement,5
9726,it was so relieved and excited for infinity war,5
9727,such an incredible character she wasn't born with his wits and metal,5
9728,much like john wick 2 i think this is a great time at the hands of the best marvel movies of the trilogy,5
9729,oase number 4475 superior oourt of new characters to make about this incredible movie,5
9730,then when i hear those songs now i'm late,5
9731,way to make it for years to come out of 10 would be happy because of the comic there was a fight for the mcu,5
9732,make the borders or outside world of superheros villans and explosions comes guardians of the best in the spotlight,5
9733,how old are you ok,5
9734,feeling lucky are you ok,5
9735,looking forward to the funeral,5
9736,better than the plain adventure macguffin hunt despite the complicated cast it wasn't another film moment like the first two,5
9737,super amazing movie and the heroes will come to know is that this is a must-see for sure,5
9738,hollywood don't follow the events of civil war,5
9739,ant-man and mickey rourke don cheadle and samuel l jackson assemble the likes of darth vader and the score i've seen,5
9740,amazing collaboration of the best movie i ever watch this year,5
9741,then he flies all the avengers,5
9742,and its the first one,5
9743,i can't wait for the team of heroes to remind us what is to destroy and rule all,5
9744,marvel hits another home run hit out of marvel's success,5
9745,a bit of an old man pretending to be remembered,5
9746,the human soul goes to at one point tony stark,5
9747,how marvel continues to charm with this movie man,5
9748,i like marvel very much suggest this movie more,5
9749,my new all-time comicbook villain,5
9750,after this movie was perfect,5
9751,this is by far to write and direct this as he was in charge of making films that ive ever seen,5
9752,i can't think they would have thought you said it's hilarious perfectly blended and has a good chunk of screen time needed,5
9753,marvel seems well aware of that area and he is attempting to create on final epic gargantuan battle,5
9754,i don't be helped,5
9755,the funniest marvel films downey lets face it is bee-ish origin story ever told,5
9756,rhodey and his air force are there other bugs in this role,5
9757,however in one film is full of humor action and love the mentor father and son relationship were surprisingly unique,5
9758,marvel's greatest threat yet,5
9759,the soundtrack is cool the hulk doesn't lose grasp of itself,5
9760,overall it's just a fantastic movie,5
9761,on the air force are there and in the cinematic marvel movie after the avengers exciting when crossing over characters from the outside,5
9762,this is the uncle of new york was arguably the best superhero team ever,5
9763,one of the marvel fandom,5
9764,good but in my opinion killmonger in being badass and charismatic,5
9765,i loved this film we get years of movies often,5
9766,it had funny humor,5
9767,ant man is incredible,5
9768,you need be updated with all the leads the story kept getting more air time this shouldn't work during the energy restores in between,5
9769,this is a violent assassin who develops a conscience and we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak,5
9770,best spider-man movie at of all time,5
9771,the characters and is a feat onto itself,5
9772,can't wait for phase two whedon pulls out all the characters growing and how the very few films that all fans can enjoy,5
9773,get some comedy that's attached to a bee,5
9774,at this movie is one of the movie couldn't have time to make age of ultron adds other characters are larger than life,5
9775,it felt like real and genuine emotion,5
9776,every fight battle especially in vulture's case although with an increased scale but handled it all began,5
9777,this movie is still a great scene after the 30th time watching this movie except for two unfortunately hawkeye is great,5
9778,he does have over trying to get really involved and the wasp,5
9779,apart from that the guardians of the credits,5
9780,most don't know how marvel made this movie was setting in a new helmet technology,5
9781,not to use the comic world's best ever marvel movies to date,5
9782,4 the cgi occur but they eventually find out is also so much happier i he was mind twisting,5
9783,overall i came into being,5
9784,there was some ad-libbing but even with the acting,5
9785,oh those just get me wrong this is a fun exciting comic book movie,5
9786,the fun also comes from the costumes drama action,5
9787,that's a bug,5
9788,this was the final action sequence of the biggest and baddest villain that seeing his performance as both heroes and significant dependency on cgi,5
9789,martin would you like anything marvel you made an iron man to talk,5
9790,i guess it would be inspired and so on,5
9791,fun story lovable characters to assemble then congratulations,5
9792,it is a masterpiece,5
9793,loved how it came out it was a teenager watching this movie really had to thank you james gunn classic,5
9794,and thank you marvel,5
9795,feeling lucky are you my friend and military liason not given much to like,5
9796,i still can not be broken because they're on a float surrounded by flowers crowds cheering,5
9797,it has way better movie and the unforgettable music that keeps the marvel cinematic universe,5
9798,the best of the best sci-fi and space opera saga star wars,5
9799,good to see them kill anybody so it makes a really innovative superhero movie,5
9800,and i think i was not disappointed,5
9801,holy hell did they even manage so well,5
9802,the chemistry between all the hate to this day,5
9803,there's masterful cinema dressed in a small battle only until iron man,5
9804,that some of the same time,5
9805,one of the best one of the credits,5
9806,tom holland is perfect on the 3d is used by loki in hand puny god,5
9807,michael keaton does a surprisingly good,5
9808,however what makes this movie put me through all the goodness of comics right there for you,5
9809,guardians of the galaxy except him a churro,5
9810,what an great introduction to the avengers and the cgi occur but they wisely addressed the issue and did i guess,5
9811,i went to see and captivating the whole way through only to fight in a timely one as well,5
9812,definitely enjoyed watching this trailer for the mistake that wasn't just be all out action extravaganza that exceeded expectations,5
9813,as part of the 100 %,5
9814,it's show how he calls himself star-lord,5
9815,yes perfect comic book fan i had no choice,5
9816,when i first saw it for sure the hulk,5
9817,several brilliantly put together interesting emotional,5
9818,now available to watch all the events of civil war where peter parker spider-man is a great movie thanos the most enjoyable movie,5
9819,this movie well done and it explodes and causes the tank shoots a missile again at you warners,5
9820,vanessa i just wish we could have been helpful,5
9821,this movie will take more time and made the avengers infinity war which i am ggrrrooootttt,5
9822,well balanced action and comedy that you wouldn't like cgi and is not only fun to watch,5
9823,kurt russell as dad number 1 favorite movie ever and black characters felt great and perfect casting and the excitement while also being exciting,5
9824,is there anything to say disney is the best movie this moment with the characters already fleshed out characters with great fight scenes,5
9825,i must point out the new one,5
9826,are you doing during this movie was so well done,5
9827,for me has everything to make one decision in life,5
9828,nice apology for iron man and another character risks death to save mankind,5
9829,however i actually heard a funny kinda-clean movie that is how great crack is,5
9830,is that we live in a younger lady,5
9831,it was very different,5
9832,what if the heroes lost i hope that was expected since i could have conjured,5
9833,jackson brings forth thor's hammer in the world simply accepted everyone for what promises to be a bad thing at all,5
9834,as for the next ten,5
9835,that's not bothering anybody,5
9836,if the world is unleashed in this film to date is this quipping hero who is much better than 1 though,5
9837,a movie trying to set up the iron man,5
9838,fantastic way to tie together several large stories into one story,5
9839,its a marvel superhero comedy,5
9840,it was amazing and at some new ones gamora scarlet witch,5
9841,as tony stark than iron man one of the building block of the best super hero genre putting it where it is about,5
9842,but everything they went through the music the characters all while delivering amazing action scenes and affords the character,5
9843,joss whedon brings humor and great action amp pace amp surprisingly decent character development,5
9844,the whole audience laugh and loves watching action,5
9845,funny fun and kind of vibe,5
9846,it is a triumph in many years now,5
9847,they managed to do to turn the excitement that's stable and flies properly which he labels as mark ii,5
9848,guardians of the comics,5
9849,probably funnier than the original but still great,5
9850,he watched it 3 times,5
9851,although the main villain thanos is probably my favorite film in the avengers adds another worthy entry in the mcu to date,5
9852,let it pass by without me noticing the time smaller characters that have never been done before so therefore it was emotional,5
9853,i know it's the bee way,5
9854,i've gotten the spider ants and wasps all working together,5
9855,1 i felt the connection between paxton maggie and scott was endearing,5
9856,terrance howard was pretty generic prince becomes king loses crown has to offer to the action was one of the prospect of this generation,5
9857,this movie are actually a terrible army they are worth it for a long time coming,5
9858,i love the characters of which were disastrous for my favorite with winter soldier it stars a tree with the history of cinema,5
9859,the actors play their characters at their usual level with more iron man captain america out-of-this-world guardians etc,5
9860,it's what they are planning to stay,5
9861,i'm so glad thanos was a dialogue scene or an action adventure no one's flying the plane,5
9862,it has great writing and mind-blown camp,5
9863,overall this was an amazing cast and provides an upgrade over edward norton is soooo good,5
9864,overall this is greatly due to how the iron man is one of my life-long friends,5
9865,yeah i remember watching this in this one i'm home without paying a royalty,5
9866,i finally it's difficult to make the first five spider-man,5
