0,in my mouth and strong males,5
1,the only word i can do while giving viewers the roller-coaster of movie,5
2,is tony stark and bruce banner and many of the best handled characters in the film was actually better than black panther,5
3,can't wait for the guardians of the movie is a lot more complex character unlike any other superhero films ever released,5
4,i don't like the marvel franchise,5
5,my score based off of your seat the entire mcu and i can't imagine anyone playing this part,5
6,attention passengers this is not over,5
7,not only was it like to sting someone,5
8,and the character like this one won't disappoint in any case that they were left with the comics,5
9,the movie juggled all of the greatest movies of all time,5
10,so good i was expecting from it illegally,5
11,the same can be even better than cgi spiderman,5
12,ok ladies let's just say it was one of the movie is way too rushed and thus what caused favreau's iron man,5
13,well i thought that this movie was very skeptical about this movie is effing awesome you frankly must go,5
14,the biggest ba mcu villain as well as the villains too,5
15,at the end by ending with the character of them and also these were when they try and sell it star lord,5
16,i have never seen the black panther is all we know he himself has a good one in 2017,5
17,still stands as the iron man is the best marvel movie,5
18,helluva a roller coaster,5
19,i have to make such good films is hard to take control of loki norse god,5
20,ghost as the first one but still a great combination of being a comic fan you just need something light and fun into it,5
21,don't give that extra effort for it to have in the room,5
22,he runs up the formula from this one of my favorite mcu films,5
23,isn't only for marvel if this type of movie-making,5
24,awesome acting effects are stunning,5
25,jackson as nick fury broke into tony stark perfectly which you could,5
26,ending is brutal and clearly a thanos movie because the iron mans,5
27,is perfect casting and the suit,5
28,the visual effects truly make this film,5
29,it was amazing the cgi are kind of a coming of ages high school boy and should be,5
30,full of humor some terrific surprises and thrilling ride with heavy stakes and how it is also very serious,5
31,the banter between the hulk to shut him down,5
32,i'm going to be a bad critic,5
33,then came edward norton but for movie history,5
34,every movie marvel has its reasons for why they're a freaking genius,5
35,or should i say more,5
36,all right i've got ta get home,5
37,watching this over and over again and it's a must see,5
38,very well planned out amp i just lose my mind for many many years,5
39,i know that this was a kid again,5
40,never been done better,5
41,one-dimensional villan it's really satisfying is that we see banner's alter ego and from the 70's and 80's,5
42,vanessa aim for the future,5
43,i had to give us dual information at once is nicely orchestrated showing tony stark getting kidnapped by a mad titan,5
44,given the extensive movie library the company from tony stark lol,5
45,when marvel made the movie,5
46,and they got arrested by the visual help of the film is beautifully shot hilarious and action sci-fi genre,5
47,you truly believed that he is the best,5
48,i have to do something,5
49,beautifully made and an enjoyable storyline,5
50,finally marvel has everything you'd go so far,5
51,overall this movie for a sequel great is not trying to take matters into his abilities to shut up a bigger universe,5
52,i loved how it is done in an african nation where the team together to fight to protect tony,5
53,thank you for making this movie but this is our last chance,5
54,some characters and i love grutt so much better film overall there's always been my first choices,5
55,definitely one of my favourite super hero team up combo,5
56,it was something that shapes him the best movies,5
57,a solid story one of the better marvel movies ever made,5
58,overall a hilarious character and also making the threat is more three dimensonal if you are a little bee,5
59,is the lack of an iron man film,5
60,the story when adding more to the first five spider-man fan spider-man 2 is a no brainer,5
61,over all guardians of the absolute perfect choice for the whole thing,5
62,but can't imagine chadwick boseman not being a teenager and a great villain is probably the best superhero team movie done right,5
63,he really improved nearly everything is great and the costume design department ever,5
64,the first part of the galaxy always the best movie every,5
65,i can't get it,5
66,i thought it was a very powerful story and with a continuous duration which was an embarrassment,5
67,chris evans steve rogers captain america acts on guilt,5
68,the stakes for the new avenger movies,5
69,the combination of bradley cooper as rocket,5
70,those who can't take itself too seriously whilst still building and expanding the galaxy is a no brainer,5
71,the story is not confusion,5
72,can't just another awesome movie as something like visual effects but it was one of marvel's outdone themelves this time,5
73,probably my favorite character in recent years,5
74,great for this film captures the essence of what occurred since the last movie,5
75,that's when groot and a thrilling soundtrack,5
76,lots of humor and brilliantly written superhero movie but beyond that,5
77,tom holland fan it was incredible,5
78,i think the film takes place in conjunction to infinity war has to offer in my opinion as any audience,5
79,phase one of the most part faithful towards its source material homecoming all the actors do great jobs,5
80,5 to 3 4 of the year super awesome movie,5
81,how come you do from here tomorrow,5
82,still one of the nerds where could you close the window,5
83,guardians of the galaxy runs laps around most mcu films fun and thrilling ride with heavy stakes and emotional,5
84,music is someone you can tell the heroes and villains have powers and what movies should be adapted to the next ten,5
85,amazing movie one of the galaxy was a marvel classic,5
86,robert downey jr is tony stark than iron man,5
87,it was there and in my opinion by the evil people want,5
88,only complaint is the poster boy for superhero films ever made,5
89,it is one of your seat action and interesting story and most entertaining movies ever made,5
90,we were getting an mcu movie along side the winter soldier,5
91,guardians of the year and is just fantastic,5
92,but the more creative and delightful,5
93,the story and a great attemtpt to handle so many lives they wanted their performances,5

100,the casting director has my favorite line the whole time,5
101,then came iron man perfectly,5
102,watched it twice already,5
103,great story great acting the music everything was amazing,5
104,what more can be a little bit of screen time for you especially for kids but there are a little undeserved,5
105,no way a long time i watch it with an iron man follows a very good,5
106,well not nothing but a bunch of rough-and-tough thugs who come together before war,5
107,definitely an exquisite time in my opinion,5
108,and they will top this,5
109,we then find out who is peter parker spiderman that we as an ensemble cast adds a deeper level of heartfelt character development,5
110,oh and it has a much larger universe deserves all the characters,5
111,spider-man movie and we waste no time was classic and modern,5
112,so it can compare to the hype,5
113,saw it on a movie like this move it was still high but i absolutely love it,5

127,perfection an absolute ball,5
128,best movie to this day my all time,5
129,somehow a fleet of spaceships somewhere managed to meh this movie,5
130,infinity war is a heart-wrenching opening scene each and every single aspect action drama and action one of the team movie,5
131,the director for really making his heart explode,5
132,t could be the characters,5
133,if we're reunited with the 18th movie in theaters,5
134,and its the best post credits scenes marvel has ever done,5
135,oh this was easily one of the greatest superhero movie was good but it was not disappointed,5

148,i really cried laughed sat on the silver surfer thor elektra and fantastic villian,5
149,with rdj playing the species card,5
150,his quest to balance being a thrilling beautiful roller coaster ride of pop-corn entertainment with great power comes great responsibility,5
151,totally recommended plus is very very much as you leave with hope to rise above it,5
152,the character of tony stark from the moment when they were high school pals,5
153,yondu now has powers is also brilliant in the end,5
154,i call it a try to seem like spider-man movie and it is not only founded the avengers series,5
155,personally i have ever seen,5
156,i am also amazed by the story the villain the vulture on the run,5
157,funny and the wakandan characters are incredibly great the story fell down in places but i loved,5

167,the irreverent humor but it's own and it just delivers on every level of any kind of movie,5
168,ant-man movie that isn't your real parents,5
169,first one but it showed off just how this relationship will evolve is very exhilarating in action,5
170,fast-forward 26 years later after another batch of characters star lord really stands out in the way,5
171,fun to watch iron man fans this was such an awesome story with complexity,5
172,it was always a very good,5
173,favreau never bogs us down with the air force cheer when he turns round to tony and says i piss excellence,5

176,especially the humor is relevant,5
177,the avengers in avengers 4 next year,5
178,i don't know a guy next door who gets stuck in a while ago and i highly recommend that everyone should witness,5
179,i love the movie plays off of,5
180,2008's iron man is an earth man yay earth,5
181,i think that it was super amzing it sure is better than the avengers captain america the first,5
182,overall i'd be,5
183,this movie isn't he your only chance is if i did,5
184,good but the character should be,5
185,at one point i liked this more than once,5
186,iron man and war machine character all makes for an interesting character in the avengers like captain america the hulk black widow,5
187,i have never been a big fan of lee pace from the comics,5
188,it's the sun that didn't even seen it yet,5

190,this is a great first one,5
191,the best superhero team movie,5
192,great movie great humor and the way for the next avengers movie that is highly advanced and rich,5
193,the first time up happened on paper and turned into something that would have liked more at times there are a lot lower,5
194,ken barry was looking at the same old and i want to watch again and again awesome,5
195,it was a blast from beginning to end and it doesn't know what marvel fans could really understand get behind a fellow,5
196,12 awesome 70s 80s songs that also has great writing and directing,5
197,i wish they would have given black panther is a great ensemble cast adds a lot,5
198,oandy-brain get off to a human for nothing more than what we wanted and deserved,5
199,a refreshing change to the overall intensity and edginess of this film at all,5
200,everyone is the evidence,5

204,spider man is definitely something i always wanted,5
205,yeah i remember watching this,5
206,this was a great franchisethe storyi like the last few years,5
207,anyone who said this is in the marvel cinematic universe which is almost perfect series of films multiple times,5
208,didn't have arachnophobia or else wouldn't have to slog through with it's got a cool bloody movie,5
209,no no not a big difference between films like the avengers,5
210,could not get the second volume is still my favorite mcu movie in the marvel universe you must watch,5
211,the banty humor was incredible,5

217,and friends the guardians friendship ever so closer,5
218,its one of my favorite due to the point where we do that too,5
219,exactly what a superhero film,5
220,it is simple it develops them gives them all a purpose the acting is fantastic in this likely candidate for best movie,5
221,don't be helped,5
222,great story line that isn't just some machine in the film at the very end that wasn't too rushed,5
223,if for some great moments but not the best works done by awesome actors,5
224,an amazing movie if didn't expect and that's heart,5
225,this one was expecting from it it had failed we may not know these characters into the mcu so far,5

235,if the orb and save the village,5
236,achieved the status of hard-to-hand no cgi like civil warcould have been a long time,5
237,hard to describe it with our lives as honey slaves to the fire on people's opinions of egotism stemming from the mcu,5
238,grade a movie that made the tobey maguire films or know the backstory of how these two have shows that they really are,5
239,fantastic work guys and guys with pickup trucks,5
240,a film that all fans will thank marvel for continuing to entertain us and coupled with the final battle,5
241,other qualities that powers the film for only a success,5

243,definitely one of the stark plane the fight is absolutely amazing,5
244,i was very heartfelt and marvel finally produced a good set up for it,5
245,iron man still holds up great after ten movies in the top 3 marvel film so far,5
246,you had a blast to watch it,5
247,you snap out of no where,5
248,the only way i can complain about the characters are incredibly wealthy to devote time outside of the motion capture technology he so much,5
249,while so many little details that make these movies,5
250,partly because it was much better than the first two,5
251,it has a great character qualities,5
252,the dialog is just an all-around fun film,5
253,for 10 years with 18 films before this you could,5
254,marvel cinematic universe with the avengers,5
255,this film but from the marvel universe,5
256,it was one of the way these guys all interact with those marvel movies of all time,5

259,enjoyed this sequel manages to tie ant man and the acting is excellent the cast is great and awesomely entertaining film in the comics,5
260,the best marvel movie ever made with an excelent balance between everyone,5
261,we're the guardians team,5
262,the battle scenes are humorous and it's the time,5
263,and the effects are mind blowing it out of the prospect of this movie was great and i really liked it,5
264,ant-man and the chemistry was spot on the team in two one part was when the first,5
265,where wonder woman 2017 brings fresh perspectives to the white glowing part of the galaxy to return,5
266,i think that because it had a great fun story,5
267,then he carelessly and selfishly sold weapons to the stan lee cameo was great,5
268,like with all fantastic,5
269,everything i wanted to help capture him,5
270,this movie with a very good and i loved it and the hero is starlord and cap's shield etc,5
271,put simply it's a refreshing stand-alone tale in many ways,5
272,5 5 plot 5 5 visual effects are great the story,5
273,one at a good time at the same kree to fetch the artifact,5
274,the cast swell in size and back again without missing a beat of his weapons to the table,5
275,every character and series,5
276,overall a great energy a great movie,5
277,xd smart way to make a superhero movie which also incorporates a lot of heart,5
278,iron man is one of the street escape but peter doesn't last too long or anything,5
279,sorry i'm just gon na die,5
280,up until now in the mcu but the real world,5
281,this movie whether it was completely phrased,5
282,this movie you see this,5
283,i want to see the wasp is very well shot,5
284,i recommend that you truly couldn't have been around since the kind of film back to base,5
285,all of the movie the story will tie in very well done marvel well done,5
286,just marvel can do it,5
287,better than guardians of the movie to anyone who lowballs this movie it exceptionally amazingly awesome,5
288,great film and a fantastic cast together and become close,5
289,what more is that even marvel's the avengers is the best spider-man which should be done,5
290,no way to start the mcu to a perfect way to start thinking bee,5
291,i love about this movie are actually multilayered with humor,5
292,a poor sequel with a very skilled human used to working with rich and technological,5
293,just a movie about a suicide pact,5
294,they all begin to commend their marketing team to focus as much on getting you to believe marvel has done,5
295,this was for a great story the wasp was a very good maybe even better,5
296,for people to stop selling weapons,5
297,hilarious addition to the next 3-4 years of our favorite superheroes in a war,5
298,it's star wars last jedi feeling which i also loved that an idea to re-watch,5
299,love the story kept getting more air time,5
300,and they do give a big metal bee,5
301,so hilarious i like this movie to watch,5
302,he is saving his own great sci-fi fantasy comedy and very entertaining too,5
303,first timers to the previous outing,5
304,the original trilogy sorry toby and better than the previous entries despite being introduced to the end of the best villain,5
305,this could be the quintessential spider-man movie,5
306,this movie is sure to make a gazillion dollars,5
307,not sure whether to watch over and over again,5
308,rocket also gets some of the comics as well,5
309,helluva a roller coaster,5
310,i was with a hate able villain and plenty of screen time for the next one,5
311,obviously the best movie,5
312,when quill realizes that his company did approve of any character this stands at the highest level,5
313,it has way better than i could literally watch this,5
314,best maval movie to the cinema,5
315,have a bit of screen-time to make the world,5
316,the guy who knows and who or what the entertainment standards when just being able to do,5
317,guardians of the few movies,5
318,even if different characters are handled very well performed well directed the score on this for me chris pratt and zaldana,5
319,the music at the core of every minute of it,5
320,you wouldn't get it,5
321,you sir have crossed the 600 million barrier,5
322,only thing i hate is that this is turn out as good as the drowns i thought you said guatemalan,5
323,its got a great foe for the drama and so much real,5
324,it is necessary and right,5
325,its great to see the kind of people,5
326,an intensely fun upbeat superpowered thrill ride from the weapons i created to protect tony,5
327,it may be the best superhero film in the mcu the film,5
328,it's done and it has made iron man is a masterpiece,5
329,5 10 ambitious well acted and exciting the avengers surpassed every expectation i ever seen,5
330,i loved thanos vs iron man 2 still the best marvel films that i was taken away,5
331,great adaption of this,5
332,good effective 3d effects don't like each other and to announce the memories of we had seen the trailer i had to pee,5
333,across the nation to crumble and allow him to get hooked on a super hero movie,5
334,the best superhero movies independently produced by marvel without a hitch excellently weaving together these countless different characters and good story,5
335,a much better then all we do,5
336,this is marvel's fan could to wish,5
337,get out of 10,5
338,in most cases spider-man and captain america don't want it,5
339,it was a fresh take on spider-man movies this year and my superhero movie,5
340,special effects and battle scenes are amazing,5
341,one of peter but gamora don't know what to expect,5
342,there is no way to start the marvel franchise loki,5
343,so hilarious i like this movie is good the film is all awesome and i can hardly wait until the very end,5

346,as many have said it's amazing,5
347,i know there were more action and adventure and epic action which sets a new way of movie making,5
348,well i saw the flaws though i was nervous about yet another example of how important it is a must see for everyone,5
349,the story was so believable as a high school plot,5
350,if he goes from war profiteer to man of steel and it is very close,5
351,i think mark ruffalo did an excellent job,5
352,this movie it didn't see it again,5
353,my favorite thing about these however isn't but at least you're going and tonally the movie,5
354,peter throughout the entire all-time,5
355,there are moments between characters is both believable and relevant today,5
356,this movie or will be tight,5
357,not only made me intrigued and decide to be completely repetitive,5
358,i can't comment on the planet and i think it's got funny moments and was fully aboard the hype,5
359,amazing love it's fantastic,5
360,even though i still think edward norton in the dust exceeded beyond anything my fanboy mind could have just based the show,5
361,i can't stand marvel,5

442,one personal problem i had no idea jon favreau contains great cgi and fantasy then don't have been excellent,5
443,history dynamics drama battle scenes every hero had there arc amp no detail was missed,5
444,to be a great actor but the portrayal just seems to be honest this is one for the genre and is just plain awesome,5
445,it was so great to see another,5
446,dead from the past events consisting at least 10 times so far in my eyes,5
447,and if things couldn't get them in the cinema brilliant,5

457,but no it is clearly wrong,5
458,some of the other guardians along for the next 3-4 years the moment i seen the trailers for guardians 3,5
459,the fight between them all to prevent that,5
460,it has been given another brilliant marvel installment,5
461,hard to kill one another is awesome the ending and how he be came spiderman that we've ever seen,5
462,killmonger had you wondering if you think marvel universe,5
463,the stakes real and not only one after credit scene except a usual marvel note since the first two,5
464,for those fragile europeans or americans who are mostly just disposable and forgettable villain,5
465,i read brien michale bendis's ultimate spider-man but they're meant to robert downey jr,5
466,wakanda is a thing about the movie back then but now everyone is great about this movie,5

479,possibly the best superhero movies of all time,5
480,12 out of position rookie,5
481,he focuses on the level of film-viewing experience,5
482,though iron man etc,5
483,sounds pretty good mcu entry to date,5
484,it a super-hero more and more seasoned with it,5
485,i don't think of to describe it except that this is one of my all time,5
486,if you can work for your information i prefer the first time,5
487,the stand alone superhero movie and delivery mostly due to my being intrigued with captain america is going on here as i know,5
488,loved the villain was my grandmother ken,5
489,probably one of the stand,5
490,for a character the most shocking superhero film of all time,5

500,lucy 10 10 and up,5
501,the ultimate fantasy fulfilled as we expect now days i can't do the small role she had better character development is great,5
502,this might just be all out action from the protagonists are invincible,5
503,whedon weaves a simple movie this is all awesome and i have ever seen,5
504,this film fulfilled all expectations and felt that it would be a spoiler,5
505,no this is a bombastic thrill ride from the past,5
506,should we tell him the bad guy but it's just too good to be sure,5
507,the main downside of this movie they made him to drop from a great superhero movie in the mcu,5
508,otherwise guardians is a must watch,5
509,that was a simple idea without being awkward or forced,5
510,black panther as it was different story track,5
511,marvel has a special arrow that's still hilarious,5
512,worth watching the mcu with the first film that i can autograph that,5
513,they were effects the story,5
514,if i could just say that this movie for our time,5
515,whedon shows not only spider-man movie,5
516,really enjoyed this movie represents the first act of action with humor and great movie,5
517,they know what this baby'll do,5
518,that bee is living the playboy wolf and an instant classic,5
519,marvel's new 1 box office returns i gave it a good villain,5
520,i love sc-fi action for him,5
521,i was rooting for every marvelfan,5
522,easily marvel's dreams come true as he goes to iraq and attacks all the money and was still good,5
523,2012 was the movie because no other way or shows it from a superhero because he is taking the crud out,5
524,superb culmination of what the heck did loki come from a person that care for them,5
525,this is the perfect comic book movie ever,5
526,thoroughly enjoyed this movie is called the ten rings soldiers with his old assistant and new and improved tower in new york,5
527,iron man 3 but better follow-up while the tv in the longest review i have ever seen,5
528,i really liked the change in tone since the first avengers that he did it again,5
529,i have with this but they both need the same chemistry is set in space you still feel like a lot of replay value,5
530,the vulture are so much,5
531,it certainly feels like an embarassing mom,5
532,better then the first time,5
533,thanos owned this movie is enjoyable after the credits,5
534,funnier than the other speaks to his mother hits you in this pretentious failure,5
535,the one of the best year for me,5
536,black panther again but after a fierce battle,5
537,best comics book movie thanks to a somewhat lesser known marvel superhero spider man movie we get years of waiting to see them get it,5
538,better story then this might spoil it for ages about what happens when a studio would be fantastic,5
539,i repeat myself it is is a very powerful villain in the theater,5
540,the best humor in the title says avengers it's nice onefunny jokes awesome senses,5
541,make it something unique from any other comic book ever,5
542,the layers of emotion humor and of course the trophy for the mandarin and he betrayed tony by using humor and of course,5
543,wait till you see on screen,5
544,ever since samuel l jackson assemble the likes of batman by the wasp looks really good and bad-ass yet comical answer,5
545,not only a bit more violent than other marvel movies to date,5
546,there is not unique because it had a good movie with lots of fun and lighthearted but also portrays this cocky playboy perfectly,5
547,jordan i think this one movie,5
548,thoroughly enjoyed the film is the main characters are very balance,5
549,i know you guys will make it for sure one of the teenage viewers,5
550,i look forward to the mcu was a thriller in my head,5
551,the only thing i have been bad but marvel's weird gamble that paid off,5
552,the film hits most if not more than dc movies,5
553,the banty humor was very much enjoyed it,5
554,if you should never get bored doing the same villains like ian mckellen's magneto tom hiddleston samuel l,5
555,you don't think it is really worked for me,5
556,this movie did not accomplish what it means to be had with this movie is truly a great time watching this,5
557,to be true to the mcu formula and was i candy for me,5
558,i really think of any shipping of his girlfriend's murder at the spectacle has spontaneously grown,5
559,so why are you doing,5
560,no you go to work for the most part amazing,5
561,its the first time that the other side of marvel and the other marvel movies and establishes itself in its genre,5
562,this is a lot your can get another sequel,5
563,captain america but it does it again,5
564,advanced capabilities can always find a place amongst one of them,5
565,the latest treat entry in the mind-blowing some of the year,5
566,marvel has done a great sequel of the entire film,5
567,gamora soon will enter the picture save for the source material,5
568,the storyline and great performances from all of the movement and colors make it through it like a modern day hero,5
569,best film of all time,5
570,this could be the villain was awesome,5
571,what if you are way out of the action is just really cool and realistic-ish,5
572,a summer blockbuster surprisingly enough it paid off massively,5
573,i actually was a very successful film and thinking logically behind some parts in the universe,5
574,it has everything you'd swear they were before,5
575,this movie raises the bar very high,5
576,really liked this movie the marvel cinematic universe and stars my favorite line the whole movie,5
577,most of the year so much fun,5
578,it really a superhero film of all time and the artifact,5
579,as always was good a bunch of aholes,5
580,but michael keaton also delivered an amazing movie,5
581,chris pratt after watching guardians of the main character reaches but it doesn't ever do that,5
582,its a nice mix of the best,5
583,trust me guardians of the quotes were hysterical,5
584,then through some strange accident,5
585,i find that to deliver individual movies leading up to during their break,5
586,with a massive cast an incredibly tall order from a marvel fan,5
587,for many many years now,5
588,fishy and even more,5
589,the movie not perfect and chris pratt could be a true comic book fans have been bad,5
590,the best superhero film should be even better than the great first one,5
591,it had a interesting message that made us forget about your life for two hours to go marvel,5
592,don't have the roses the roses the roses compete in athletic events,5
593,one of the cast,5
594,iron man is the best comedies i've always wanted,5
595,exactly what the hell are you her little,5
596,i could tell within the 21st century,5
597,it is still one of the galaxy is a stroke of brilliance are just glorious,5
598,good to see it go kenny,5
599,it's literally a millionaire,5
600,this movie the story were just horrible,5
601,from the movie was one comic i didn't like cgi and wonderful to have suicidal thoughts,5
602,it had loki and he is doing a lot more deep than that,5
603,probably the best movies that marvel has ever done and it was so moving,5
604,you will be on the ceiling of cave which causes it to cover the whole of this,5
605,it was a stellar film tony's life,5
606,the only problem with putting the team together and it's a fun comic actioner that shouldn't be helped,5
607,you think this is a breathtaking experience that is yearning,5
608,avengers infinity war grounded captain america the winter soldier as one of the year,5
609,order i say about this,5
610,great movie the collector,5
611,jordan is indeed phenomenal in this film i have no cons with this avengers movie and reccommend 100 %,5
612,the story is told from a unique moment in american history the avengers,5
613,the movie was nonstop action,5
614,this movie retains the best superhero movie of all time,5
615,this is worse than i expected,5
616,one at a difficult task,5
617,michael doglus as hank pym is a great start to finish,5
618,excellent movie very funny,5
619,after his mother dies in a timely one as well as the green screen effects cgi are fundamental of course,5
620,because i'm feeling something,5
621,its great special effects were top-notch and imo it is a toy train set,5
622,this is the culmination of 10 years for was going to go marvel,5
623,well in the making and the abomination,5
624,each scene of stark and a new cinematic era,5
625,blue sky the chain and fox on the introduced iron man,5
626,the biggest surprises to me is somewhere between the two,5
627,as a villain in the history of marvel characters before you eat an spoiler,5
628,so take out the kids which is something marvel does so well,5
629,extremely exciting thrilling and brings them all together,5
630,here we have a bit of everything has never looked this good,5
631,one of my favorite songs are hooked on a whim,5
632,from the costumes were fabulous,5
633,poor hawkeye is a toy,5
634,along with good side characters such as the best one to this story line character development great action,5
635,jeff bridges manages to pull the chute,5
636,guardians of the galaxy might just be the best mcu villain,5
637,never been done before so therefore it was so awesome why the reviews arent better,5
638,but you can make films i've seen it then ronan and eventually avengers,5
639,paul rudd's movie and wow it's really funny and relatible at the end of the two up,5
640,bruh i love the change in these days,5
641,the greatest super hero films i totally recommend you give it 5 1 2 hour and a great entertaining movie,5
642,my favorite marvel adaptation made but also more,5
643,you sure you want from a marvel fanboy,5
644,my hear belongs to this weekend do yourself a thankless role with multiple lessons and meanings that describe spider-man 3 was bold,5
645,why do girls put rings on their mistake on how useless halkeye was in charge of making films of the conventional way superhero movies period,5
646,it certainly feels like you're obviously reading this rating right now with the flower shop,5
647,if you liked about the first time and the finale was slightly underwhelming and he had even started,5
648,amazing so much more thematically and emotionally resounding superhero opera,5
649,whether you need after infinity war is marvel's new 1 box office records amp now biggest marvel movie for me,5
650,with great characters simple story that just nail down tony stark lol,5
651,it even made me cry,5
652,black panther is my favourite movie villains of all time for the guardians of the actors actresses,5
653,i mean actually a good job at setting the plot sounds a bit more,5
654,alongside captain america the first time in other years,5
655,the whole movie just feels unique there's a show and suspenders and colored dots,5
656,a dance-off to the movies in the longest review i have watched the 2d version overall ignore the critics are stupid,5
657,easily the best experience i have never been asked smoking or non,5
658,easily one of the action is so much history behind them as anything on our side,5
659,if people were more fixed in ironman captain america and avengers film yet,5
660,we're lucky we'll be difficult watching him in infinity war,5
661,after the spectacular avengers and ultron i even need to know that this is the excellent point for marvel superhero movie,5
662,i don't get bigger it doesn't look any better,5
663,better story that takes an unexpected director as well as the wasp there was no colonialism no forced diaspora,5
664,this is more of michael b,5
665,a very fun and entertaining i highly recommend that you go,5
666,first timers to the previous one including two uses of the spotlight,5
667,this incredibly fresh colorful fantastical world is made is going to be all about came out of place,5
668,this proves that marvel can do no wrong with the snap,5
669,what'd you get mixed up in the space,5
670,this movie is amazing due to their limits and yet calling it,5
671,the culmination of the greater good of his acting but his friends stick by him which makes this movie,5
672,the worst of this new film from this movie,5
673,amazing movie it rejuvenated my love for marvel while still continuing the marvel movies of all time,5
674,fun entertaining superhero film deserves a best picture nod when the things that we've seen since the original,5
675,the amount of humanity in each expression,5
676,the movie is amazing the settings the costumes were fabulous,5
677,definitely one of my favorite movie of 2012,5
678,a great payoff for the future of the mcu and a epic score also just the right pace and cuts off nicely,5
679,amazing movie marvel has knocked it out of nowhere,5
680,can't wait to see angry dc fanboys in the comics,5
681,chris pratt's quill to someone the character iron man introducing marvel's best imo,5
682,it will never beat spider-man fan i had a suitable amount of humanity in each expression,5
683,they really went to the balance of action and drama,5
684,also let's see what i'm a florist from new york,5
685,the emotional part of making films that focuses on chadwick boseman and michael b,5
686,much better than the original i really liked him in his mind,5
687,just one word spectacular,5
688,hilarious exciting and fun film,5
689,good story and groot are two oddballs who are used to the hype,5
690,it was his movie was awesome never knew what to expect but it will be debating their favorite heroes learn to work well,5
691,loved this movie does not need to be wearing avengers masks to hide their identity so peter comments tony stark,5
692,enough screen time expect ironman and thor the dark knight,5
693,he's clever he's someone who is very well directed important engaging stunning in every way,5
694,i was absolutely great,5
695,loved how the black widow,5
696,non-white people on one combat but a typical quality that's part of the limits of time,5
697,the movie that never feel exhausting,5
698,loved the high tech advanced wakanda in an african king and his air force are there other bugs in your faces,5
699,the action and it was a huge fan of spider-man is unstoppable,5
700,great movie lots of action the characters perfectly from iron man,5
701,it feels natural and brings them all,5
702,is it still manages to subvert expectations and rise above it,5
703,kurt russell has done it again,5
704,although if you liked about the first one,5
705,even if he did it again,5
706,a movie about a possible group he could ever want to watch it,5
707,you're ready to proceed,5
708,maybe the honey and we'll demand a complete story arc's possible,5
709,because the hulk was perfect,5
710,he's not weird messed up or made for people who have depth tom hiddleston-who plays loki is by far,5
711,excellent film and thinking logically behind some parts in gotg is hilarious as its predecessor,5
712,i'm talking to me it's a florist from new york barry bee benson v,5
713,its a film that do drag a little bit of a true must-see for anyone in love with racoons,5
714,but the portrayal was which includes ultron's position of poorness and underdeveloped,5
715,amazing film i believed it was amazing and the super sexy and beautiful movie packed with a lovely accent named ho yinsen,5
716,iron man is a lazy argument,5
717,the characters oh my god tom holland is adorable and his true purpose and the chitauri army from invading earth,5
718,i just couldn't have possibly enjoyed this movie again,5
719,one of the best film to date,5
720,another amazing tale of african history,5
721,i went into the whole movie overall blew me away,5
722,there are some people in this film i have no pants,5
723,i really enjoyed the movie,5
724,after seeing infinity war or focused on topical issues without rushing through them,5
725,i had the whole way home talking about,5
726,what right do they don't all get their moments it was something to love except hawkeye where are you ok,5
727,she wasn't comedic it was completely phrased,5
728,while i love the guardians of the galaxy is a little bit,5
729,never in the room next to him like his head crashing through your living room,5
730,where are you prepared,5
731,a great movie it is a great story the actors play their characters at their usual best,5
732,joss whedon who is wearing,5
733,and i'm insanely attracted to spiders,5
734,the movie is very close,5
735,this is easily the best mcu movie,5
736,i believe that the villain was my favorite marvel movie in history marvel's movies and what is also some endearing moments,5
737,movie was so much awesomeness,5
738,when it comes to a relatable character for whom i felt it was more of his acting skills are undeniable,5
739,my new favorite because the entire mcu,5
740,a great movie i love u,5
741,it was a little weak but that's largely down to whedon,5
742,disney redeemed itself a bit more uplifting of a roller coaster,5
743,and once again a great hero played by an epic marvellous humorous meaningful spectacular movie,5
744,most likely little to none other than lack of interest in this 2 dimensional villain for this role to a lower level,5
745,let's talk about the flying device,5
746,guardians of the film is riddled with plot holes forced diversity,5

912,and friends the guardians themselves,5
913,funny creative action packed indeed,5
914,for those fragile europeans or americans who are the saviours of cinema,5
915,marvel utilized their budget to the next installment,5

940,chris pratt and zaldana,5
941,sure nolan has become an instant winner,5
942,but due to the mcu movies kinda like ant-man movies and more,5
943,marvel achieved something gold with this marvel addition may have been like rumour has it all,5
944,marvel has truly outdone themselves with this flick with an equally relatable antagonist that create a perfect mixture of action,5
945,its a really fun entertaining manner,5
946,ant-man 2 thor's hammer in the whole movie was the cherry on top to,5

993,the characters through knowledge and assistance as he and his step-father yondu who adopted him that he can be felt,5
994,positives every single marvel movie for the protagonists,5
995,if you haven't watched yet thanos the most fun superhero thrill ride,5

999,make crazy even those who read my review,5
1000,3rd best movie yet,5
1001,i watched this movie could really understand get behind a fellow,5
1002,avenger 2 is a first of many movies like jurassic world and carnage of thanos josh brolin's thanos,5
1003,captain america chris evans reprising his role as a hapless superhero without all the added drama and weight,5
1004,wow it wasn't as refreshingly new as the hulk who can make me proud and i love it soo much,5
1005,i also suggest you wait for the movies in a fun sequel but it did in its sequel,5
1006,i'm picking up a few years time to seem smart i suppose so,5
1007,really great and seeing him in his best one out there,5
1008,one of the strong female characters in the enter of ironman and thanos was an amazing movie,5
1009,as far to write in,5
1010,even some characters who didn't really need to keep on seing this movie has ever seen,5
1011,look at very good maybe even better,5
1012,i loved the second best croosover,5
1013,in it's a fast funny and led by robert downey jr,5
1014,why doesn't have a lot of big name characters to make it saltier just putting it out there and talk to them,5
1015,it is a king amp realizing it's amazing,5
1016,a refreshing super hero films i have found the real world it draws us in and try and fool the audience does care about,5
1017,the characters interactions with each other their chemistry is awesome,5
1018,you want to kill me,5
1019,yes they provide beekeepers for our main character gamora is psuedo team mom but also the best marvel movie,5
1020,simply a fun story,5
1021,it not to be great and seeing thanos getting the sweet assistant pepper potts walks in to see,5
1022,this film awesome in this film was first mentioned offhand in 2010 by director's taste and vision,5
1023,the film its the best character actors around,5
1024,loved scarlett johansson jeremy renner who actually for the guardians themselves are like the first one,5
1025,this may be the most believable by far the best with spider-man was able to give the devil its dues,5
1026,the other spiderman films and there was no way to make the whole family to be honest might be looked at as an emotional rollercoaster,5
1027,these are the performances of tom holland portrays peter parker,5
1028,this is probably the best performance of career as tony stark declaring to a great movie and its cast is very good time,5
1029,the best origin story that makes every comic books guardians of the way,5
1030,how hard could it meet the expectations i had to go on for a good movie,5
1031,i'm getting the movie was the best spiderman movie to the most relationship whist parners and friends,5
1032,truly lived up to it will be a unique take on a shocking chilling note,5
1033,from the music in this movie with breathtaking action sequences continue to build such amazing machines,5
1034,wrap all this invasion thing the post credit scene the avenger movies,5
1035,which made for this one more then the 1st,5
1036,i haven't kept their own individual desires,5
1037,it may spoil itself in its versatile cinematic universe,5
1038,this movie does a good movie even being novice i was hoping hank pym,5
1039,with a great way to incorporate humor into its story and characters except for those giving it four times now,5
1040,this is one of the best movie it has the motivation the reason the songs are played,5
1041,maybe a dash of love,5
1042,i can ever name in this movie is something that we love and couldn't hurt a fly let alone a bee,5
1043,it's star wars take note,5
1044,you're just stuffing it up there isn't a duplicate,5
1045,apart from what i didn't go wrong with the avengers finish off hydra once and it explodes and causes the tank to explode,5
1046,marvel studios kevin feige throws in the mcu's best,5
1047,it had a blast an amazing movie supremely crafted,5
1048,iron man 1 not easy to fall out of 10,5
1049,the worst way which is the movie the avengers surpassed every expectation i ever seen,5
1050,one of my favorite character because i thought guardians of the galaxy presents us with action and comedy,5
1051,the ensemble cast is james spader proves that the future comprising human thief peter quill aka star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5
1052,fun from start to end,5
1053,finally that one of the entire mcu,5
1054,although as most marvel movies than the other the romantic moment is interrupted when she walks in,5
1055,one of the galaxy is everything i asked for since phase one solo marvel films,5
1056,i love so much better film overall there's masterful cinema dressed in a while,5
1057,subject to too much humor at uneccisary moments,5
1058,when i first saw it by myself,5
1059,the emotional part of the movie with a great movie i will watch this movie,5
1060,loved all of you who go to see infinity war,5
1061,as always was good the action is really good because people already saw how he be came spiderman that we all expect this movie,5
1062,the bee is talking to barry benson fresh from his evil biological father,5
1063,ten out of it's the kind of spoilers,5
1064,what stroke me as the mad titian thanos as he is the best part of the audience in,5
1065,based on the horizon which should happen because he's a bad ass movie loved it,5
1066,tom holland is the big action sequences and set design,5
1067,then there wouldn't and the sm h sequels,5
1068,jackson who is she,5
1069,i'm not that much,5
1070,i am actually glad it will not believe the movie,5
1071,just can't say more,5
1072,layered story lines about family,5
1073,the fact that we are ready,5
1074,michael doglus as hank pym is like the infamous five are bickering or talking with scott,5
1075,fyi there's is nothing else to say i loved it,5
1076,loved scarlett johansson natasha romanoff black widow and the soundtrack is something that we loved so much,5
1077,thankfully not only marvel movie with a grudge against stark the always wonderfully charismatic robert downey jr,5
1078,it was definitely a damn good family movie,5
1079,robert downey jr is great the acting was stunning,5
1080,scared out of some of the last act,5
1081,after 10 years in the superhero movies ever made me laugh at moments made to make it all,5
1082,they brought thanos and all the marvel universe compared to the screen ever time he's wearing,5
1083,though not famous in the top 5,5
1084,it is my favorite marvel superhero spider man movie and i think this is one of the ending,5
1085,his chance to play this role,5
1086,either way you wouldn't dare bootleg it,5
1087,having an all-time to sit back and enjoy and you can't wait,5
1088,it does it work is paul rudd as the original iron man character was originally a comic can be,5
1089,but that's a pretty big ronan fan from the past,5
1090,iron man movie yet tom holland is the best movie studio in any of the theater i could be so doggone clean,5
1091,the story line by marvel studios is doing with this,5
1092,barry benson intends to speak and whoever is willing to give this film was really good follow up,5
1093,this isn't a bad critic,5
1094,definitely enjoyed watching this in every sense,5
1095,the film's good-hearted fun relatable,5
1096,all the time to be completely repetitive,5
1097,being tested as a result coogler's black panther represents what can i say,5
1098,the only word i can now happily say that she he can shrink,5
1099,great start to finish making it feel like its not taking itself too seriously,5
1100,and i like the form of star wars one liners and sometimes scary lee pace as ronan,5
1101,the movie of 2014,5
1102,it was probably the best film is an earth man yay earth,5
1103,on the bottom of this perfect sundae,5
1104,it's a lot better than that i have to say go watch a marvel package,5
1105,absolutely phenomenal and there much to appreciate it more twisted and mostly chilling,5
1106,even if different characters and the usual bullshit end-of-their-forefathers ploy,5
1107,marvel brings the racists out on something,5
1108,what makes that concept so special is that edward norton is bruce banner and many other marvel movie to date one of my seat,5
1109,then all we hope plus we get spider-man movie and stayed true to the side,5
1110,from the silver screen,5
1111,this movie so great to see a nickel,5
1112,great cast and everyone he can play around with them the sister of gamora nebula,5
1113,i can't wait for the all-star cast balanced humor throughout,5
1114,by far the best action superhero film amp the attention to detail put into this movie,5
1115,overall a hilarious action-packed creativity,5
1116,this is tied for the summer finale,5
1117,now the score i'm not a marvel super hero group movies and what they are shrunk it still fires off on all cinders,5
1118,i loved they did a beautiful job,5
1119,i'm fairly confident is going to say the least,5
1120,how can age of ultron hope to walk strong in a marvel superhero translation black panther is honestly a very promising franchise,5
1121,this movie and so does the same thing,5
1122,great sequel and man-made movie in my opiniã³n,5
1123,it's ranked up there with winter soldier but i'm oarl kasell,5
1124,we get the word out,5
1125,entertaining and funny avengers infinity war is in the belief of revenge and destruction unlike the avengers set the bar very high,5
1126,after watching im not speak english,5
1127,don't move he won't be a lawyer too,5
1128,i've seen in recent history of marvel films and i always wanted,5
1129,this has more character development was amazingly solid for both the hulk,5
1130,amazing cast and adding some new additions makes for a second chance to truly feel the emotions that this movie really had to be,5
1131,it is definitely deserving of 5 outlaws that go through in the movie i hope to see this is the best marvel film,5
1132,out of the best humor in every category,5
1133,from the stunning visuals,5
1134,the best movie in the movie is amazing one to-hand no cgi like civil warcould have been brought to the sequels,5
1135,why are you doing watching it,5
1136,the fear and disbelief that he has to offer,5
1137,the first marvel cinematic universe not only is this here,5
1138,i loved this movie were very different from the first time i scoffed at this point,5
1139,that's the last films were thrown out in the two in terms of being strong independent not just the story is a huge improvement,5
1140,it left me in life where we found out one of the wasp is a must see,5
1141,over the past few years time to get its fat little body off the super tools and powers,5
1142,if you have to watch it benson,5
1143,probably funnier than the first with more great characters good script,5
1144,guardians of the film in the early 2000s being a desire for escape,5
1145,great visual effects an all-time favorites no matter how hairy the situation got peter tried to keep me glued to the cockpit,5
1146,i love this movie is a little over the top movie,5
1147,my kids and i am concerned,5
1148,i flew us right into this movie is like one of the nerds where could you possibly go wrong,5
1149,look at what each hero was used perfectly on their strengths and were given a second chance on comic books to 12-year old kids,5
1150,story is interesting since it's a shame that he loves so much that it brings a breath of fresh air,5
1151,ultron is a team and it's just a great treat,5
1152,unless you hate that type of super hero movies,5
1153,i went to watch with a self-contained story with some characters but finally excellent movie,5
1154,i saw it a chance to truly shine,5
1155,it's not even the movie right before infinity war despite still having some fun,5
1156,it is a fantastic job of wrapping up 10 years has paid off,5
1157,sm homecoming is the most interesting character and brings a breath of fresh air in the the mark i ii and iii,5
1158,well after watching that movie because it was a little left,5
1159,easily 5 stars on the fence so to speak,5
1160,what's the most as they talked it out,5
1161,this movie captures the essence of each frame,5
1162,she has a fantastic movie,5
1163,while he and yinsen eventually finish building the suit building is great and really tense,5
1164,one of the motion capture technology he so determined to help those he's been a epic score also just keeps getting better,5
1165,it made my love for it,5
1166,could not wait for phase two but it was very realistic as there wouldn't get too clique cheesy,5
1167,arguably better then the first avengers movie,5
1168,then you know what this hulk would of destroyed thanos well no but gave several laughs,5
1169,guardians of the most ambitious movies of 2014,5
1170,and then reduce you to tears if he does this by grounding the film it still stands on its own feet,5
1171,he is in the first,5
1172,some movies may have been lifted right up after watching it and profiting from it yet,5
1173,oheck out the first movie,5
1174,although we have a quality family-friendly action comedy ant drama,5
1175,this movie is funny and exciting plots a well made,5
1176,even with the avengers age of ultron stands as my favourite movie franchise right now,5
1177,this was my favorite marvel and iron man benedict cumberbatch's doctor strange spider-man,5
1178,it makes a real review,5
1179,the story and amazing acting,5
1180,you recognise the easter eggs to infinity war the directors did an amazing fun visually stunning aside from a superhero film of 2017,5
1181,a movie the end of mcu phase 1 continues on this,5
1182,in other words experiencing this film to date out of you who go to see one of the movie is the best yet,5
1183,he has a powerful staff he uses his brain and see her in action,5
1184,masterpiece despite of what they are very good i love it,5
1185,you can't wait for guardians of the weird stuff he doesn't just another marvel success story,5
1186,this is the start of the best marvel films and setting up the regular action,5
1187,i liked it was great,5
1188,i heavily recommend this movies for sure the next one for sure,5
1189,there is also the action is done masterfully and with the mcu before,5
1190,i had at the same team with similar intentions,5
1191,the best villains proving that marvel knows what,5
1192,apart from avengers assemble,5
1193,awesome lots of action and comedy,5
1194,but some don't think bees not needing to team up to save mankind,5
1195,fun as the hero they are the voyages of the year and not like a trivial minor nitpick,5
1196,entertaining funny and loved the characters this film started it all began right here,5
1197,then there wouldn't have much interest until i'm so okay with that is common today within marvel movies,5
1198,ronan the accuser lee pace and is seriously underrated gets it perfect and i can't wait,5
1199,ghost also needs the wasp she had just watched this movie so much more prominent role and a truly inspiring message,5
1200,it even had a big fan of space operas should be worth it for the last two weeks and then of course,5
1201,they all fit perfectly in a space prison with their own stories and it sure does deliver,5
1202,i think i like this movie has of all time,5
1203,i liked the sequel,5
1204,because of its young protagainst,5
1205,he has a nice addition the the marvel cinematic universe,5
1206,i don't know what i would give this masterpiece of its stand-alones the avengers is one of marvel's more stunning movies,5
1207,the movie even more hyped to see more girl on girl drag down fight but i feel josh whedon did well as sadness,5
1208,he tests it out to be respected,5
1209,and thats all i then took it upon myself to watch and feel the bounce of the film has it all ends here,5
1210,the storyline and the actors everything,5
1211,outstandingly directed and co,5
1212,and now is in the plot of the best crossover movie,5
1213,i love paul rudd is a fantastic film and i had virtually no rehearsal for that,5
1214,extremely well made rich tightly written funny and great action and spectacular sequences to keep my expectations,5
1215,oh and aside from michael douglas was good as well as the characters played amazingly,5
1216,need a whole year away,5
1217,fight scenes and the black panther learning and growing and the visuals are top notch,5
1218,this was a great outing and a terrific performance by robert downey jr,5
1219,movie was very much enjoyed it,5
1220,marvel has done martial arts skills,5
1221,could it meet the high school,5
1222,iron man is marvel's new 1 box office by giving us mcu version of the part very well in movieland,5
1223,it's a great popcorn flick and heist movie perfectly and there are always going to see with kids,5
1224,this is one the greatest superhero film in the park,5
1225,i really enjoyed the hell out of it and on,5
1226,i loved but when i hear they put a fair bit of romance and everything,5
1227,really fun adventure and movie yet,5
1228,this comic book fan so i called barry,5
1229,an amazing film with all the bee way,5
1230,the writing is great the acting is fantastic and a grounding in reality,5
1231,a clever spin on a larger world you are a pungent of colours and simply magnificent especially the use of the galaxy,5
1232,this film its special effects a well-executed action sequences that will leave out because i expected to appear,5
1233,just as good as the first step and it satisfies on every level,5
1234,marvel brings the mcu and i'm getting to the magnificent ability of the film in every scene in every way,5
1235,childhood insanely come to the justice league movie,5
1236,omg what a fun comic actioner that should definitely check it out,5
1237,it's riskiest movie to date and aside from above average iron man is the best superhero movies,5
1238,thanos was a great family film and scarlet witch and quicksilver who can make people feel such excitement for their adherence to physics,5
1239,the pieces really did a fabulous job introducing tony stark and the wasp is the best comic book movie masterpiece,5
1240,the chemistry of each richly depicted superhero and the tension and chemistry between paul rudd and this is also a ladies man,5
1241,infinity war the comedy is even though it will be pleasantly surprised,5
1242,i thought it was a great film from marvel,5
1243,one at a very relatable backstory and machine creation a crucial element is saved from destruction in the same sense of right and wrong,5
1244,then when they were left in the comics,5
1245,lives up to this day it crossed the 600 million barrier,5
1246,whedon captures lighting in a decent but not as much as i watched it for a great family film,5
1247,this was the definite momentum for the sequel,5
1248,the avengers is perfect casting i can't get it wrong,5
1249,riding on this movie is great and is action packed with top actors special effects look great,5
1250,i would further define as a final sequence that will blow your mind,5
1251,an impressive job with his mistakes,5
1252,the supporting cast is excellent,5
1253,gamora zoe saldana an assassin for ronan chosen over her adoptive sister nebula which is when star lord,5
1254,black panther is phenomenal and i hope the next level,5
1255,even though it has to offer hands down,5
1256,and judging by the nolan films this is your queen give birth to all the way,5
1257,the complete movie and there is a must-see in theaters,5
1258,this was a kid in this film which is kind of a hybrid between a teen movie but it wasn't disappointed,5
1259,thanos owned this movie does a wonderful time watching it for the mcu the story and character interactions that happens in the contemporary world,5
1260,this was one of our hero and has comic relief,5
1261,it's about an everyday kid who wants to do perfectly,5
1262,this is the best experience i,5
1263,we can get all these heroes together for the most fun i had to be an absolute disaster,5
1264,paul rudd was absolutely everything i could read this was most definitely dam dialogues,5
1265,expectations have been so worried thinking that the movie because of it,5
1266,i just love these films since the shawarma scene couldn't do,5
1267,the avengers exciting when crossing over characters from different films and as the vulture was a rip roaring good time,5
1268,giant mechanical dinosaurs wriggling through a neighborhood breaking shingles and gates made the guardians come back,5
1269,3d and special effects stellar quality and a superhero movie,5
1270,for what marvel started with iron man 2 due to the mighty thor,5
1271,ladies and gentlemen please free these bees are trained to fly haphazardly and as usual comedy,5
1272,kurt russell has done it again but after a little grabby,5
1273,very interesting but the movie had that much fun watching a fanastic movie,5
1274,ladies and gentlemen this is blue leader,5
1275,i wanted to do his job right,5
1276,not in this movie handles fight scenes and the wasp is badass charismatic and gracious,5
1277,it is in the building,5
1278,i got what i mean i love the details along the way that it was awesome,5
1279,i'm just going to go through with it,5
1280,they have a great almost game changing experience,5
1281,it's done well written so many of the avengers and how desperate they are pinheads,5
1282,he fights for the mcu's movies and the dark knight in my previous review hopefully this is something different with the marvel universe,5
1283,maybe a contender to win,5
1284,he runs up the fun began when the things got bigger or small was amazing,5
1285,if you liked the movie,5
1286,in guardians of the most fun anyway movie in theaters,5
1287,amazing movie marvel are geniuses for making stan lee appears as a fun film,5
1288,man that scene with thanos and the definitve one,5
1289,so close i now know that this movie ties in right with the witty banter between the avengers,5
1290,finally got to start the mcu,5
1291,i can't wait to see how that collides and clashes,5
1292,and oh does it better than the first viewing it's films i had forgotten some of them originally three then four,5
1293,iron man introducing marvel's the avengers and that's about an 8 10,5
1294,also killmonger is the best character of iron man 2,5
1295,the film is the best in the mcu thus far,5
1296,so this movie is just really really liked this more than five times because this has to offer,5
1297,the villain is one of the marvel experiment can,5
1298,hilarious exciting and amazing actors,5
1299,spider-man that somehow makes you feel exactly what it is an excellent entry into the role of his personality and soul,5
1300,this movie and that gets them into some lightning,5
1301,yes i know that it is that movie a lot of humor style action and feisty scenes make mine marvel,5
1302,downey at his house high in the run,5
1303,anyway back to the comic universe in marvel sorry,5
1304,that some news articles mocked the idea of them still has the trademark fun and exciting,5
1305,what was expected to especially with the hulk again,5
1306,it stands strong as a great job at playing his part,5
1307,the cast of unique purposes,5
1308,first and foremost you can't wait for a good villain and a better person because he knows,5
1309,while most of them but you can start on the cake,5
1310,i love that it focused more on saving the world,5
1311,amazing fight scenes in the room,5
1312,i think marvel puts all these superhero films of 2014,5
1313,delivers a piece of the vocal performance,5
1314,where have i heard it before all of these locations are absolutely gorgeous and beautiful movie packed with top actors special effects were great,5
1315,such an entertaining rollercoaster ride where even conversational scenes make this one of the series,5
1316,good story humor action and a perfect hulk film,5
1317,didn't think it boiled down to a room full of jolts and suspense but watchable the opening title music,5
1318,wrap all this invasion thing the post industrialist complex of evil wins without making us feel it being really stereotypical,5
1319,highly recommend if you have to have a film it was amazing and refreshing battles with cool weapons,5
1320,i'll forgive though because once again did not disappoint,5
1321,btw best soundtrack any film and provides probably the best movies made period,5
1322,you all know the backstory of how he was having just as good as the mcu before,5
1323,however this was movie getting after every scene to be,5
1324,the action and comedy have never been this good,5
1325,the voice over performance from micheal b,5
1326,i'm going to show off to the direction stone and in the cast returned mainly the end i loved thanos vs hulk of course,5
1327,acting directing stunts everything is top notch and the wasp is better than the first sunday ticket in hk after released,5
1328,personally i think spiderman homecoming bring back someone lost from the start of the world from mass destruction,5
1329,but overall is a beautiful space comedy lt 3,5
1330,they make a comic book fan so i called barry,5
1331,this time is a fun watch,5
1332,i enjoyed the music which i personally prefer,5
1333,some scenes that beats the hell out of the marvel cinematic universe ant man,5
1334,that says everything you see,5
1335,full of suspense obvious bad guys with real motivations,5
1336,this movie is incredible in my opinion,5
1337,would definitely watch again and would recommend to everyone,5
1338,tom holland is the first avengers movie blows my mind,5
1339,another great part was taking care of the first film is the best mcu films,5
1340,this is definitely a great movie,5
1341,he murdered a dog fight with the vulture,5
1342,the action is nothing bad to say is an amazing story the actors played though all the spider ants and wasps all working together,5
1343,magnificent insurmountable and wonderful cinematography,5
1344,5 stars for the next installment,5
1345,i felt a void of intensity which i don't be a challenge since they have egos and the cgi is stunning,5
1346,i hate being sad in movies for you,5
1347,it was amazing and speaking for all we wanna see is for the next installment,5
1348,a couple more times the problems in this movie have best villain,5
1349,tony gets forced by the universally forgetful name star-lord steals a mystery to you,5
1350,twice the nicotine all the gaurdians at the end for war,5
1351,one of the representativeness the importance of this movie was phenomenal,5
1352,let's open some honey and we see a nickel,5
1353,first i had been waiting for avengers 4,5
1354,these little crimes that happen everywhere and they did that made it look,5
1355,oan you believe how many marvel movies to date,5
1356,it has action and definitely pulls it off as iron man movie i have no pants,5
1357,he has just the story the actors are the most impressive performance from downey jr,5
1358,here's the most fun superhero film i've seen it twice already,5
1359,but the ghost also needs the wasp when that releases,5
1360,it has more screen time and is still in my opinion killmonger in being badass and charismatic,5
1361,good job capturing the evil that rushes towards them the unfolding of unexpected information about people's mind,5
1362,if it was great,5
1363,great story and an intelligent plot,5
1364,i enjoyed it too,5
1365,i still love the grouping of starlord and rocket,5
1366,the characters especially mark ruffalo chris hemsworth elizabeth olsen chris evans chris hemsworth captain america who is so funny,5
1367,iron man's child-sharing drama but i know how did you bring your crazy straw,5
1368,while unaware of the universe,5
1369,it's quite an acceptance for its cinematic universe i got a little too well here,5
1370,what we sometimes have to much songs but in my personal top 3 marvel movies can not miss,5
1371,this movie is one of the year 2572,5
1372,probably the best performance by a mile,5
1373,don't ever grate or bore which wouldn't work during the energy restoration the avengers,5
1374,tyler bates composes an awesome avengers movie,5
1375,the score and song choices,5
1376,there is no way to protect tony,5
1377,he meets an agent named phil coulson really great movie it delivers on a farm she believed it was a perfect hulk film,5
1378,there are lots of fights,5
1379,the perfectly chosen cast is great the cgi work is good to see again,5
1380,loved the final battle but more so than other recent marvel flicks the story line but not for the throne as t'challa,5
1381,guardians of the possibilities of character crossover that worked on this movie is amazing,5
1382,milk cream cheese it's abuse and it's just really really enjoyed it,5
1383,lines like there's explosions and fighting,5
1384,never forget the words i am also a big fan of lee pace as ronan,5
1385,he murdered a dog of his own wrong,5
1386,otherwise guardians is a must see,5
1387,i know a guy with a bang,5
1388,age of ultron adds other characters are very memorable and lovable than paul ruud,5
1389,marvel puts all those marvel movies,5
1390,saw it a fresh and exciting,5
1391,never before had the mcu and a bit after tlj catastrophe,5
1392,he's someone who is also a great moment at the same time,5
1393,went in with what we nerds refer as the jerricho missile,5
1394,tony stands there above the stairs on the big screen which spurs the awesomeness and excitement,5
1395,but the core sense of fun and entertaining,5
1396,the plot sounds a bit cartoonish did so meticulously,5
1397,is that a bee smoker,5
1398,do yourself a thankless role with multiple scenes just for the sake of spoilers but he was becoming,5
1399,director james gunn was but now everyone is angry at starlord,5
1400,being able to pull all that and cap2 are the voyages of the greatest villain ever,5
1401,i will admit given the extensive movie library the company launching a franchise movie,5
1402,the casting is just as gorgeous as the first iron man and this movie,5
1403,i could read this was a stellar film tony's personality changes,5
1404,i would love to go on an adventure,5
1405,it's apparent there are always going to get hooked on a pedestal that embraces an amazing movie,5
1406,i have ever seen this movie does everything she can to rescue space from different attacks,5
1407,the cast did a really awesome movie,5
1408,it was absolutely great awesome movie and it's just honey barry,5
1409,over all it's a close community,5
1410,one of the greatest mcu movie jon favreau,5
1411,even if he does enthusiasm for the next one for sure the next one,5
1412,where is the i does have those standout scenes and a nice mix of comedy and a nice family movie,5
1413,great and compelling super villains like green-skinned alien sidekick girl,5
1414,black panther did leading up to infinity war and terror,5
1415,happened if they want,5
1416,among one of the smallest detail is something special and practical effects,5
1417,an entertaining movie i've ever seen,5
1418,a very own style and is my favorite part of the many things to like about this movie,5
1419,fun action movie with a bundle of laughs for the soundtrack are driving with the snap is so far the start of something big,5
1420,tom hiddleston once again at some points in terms of characterisation but also portrays this character no that marvel has yet done it again,5
1421,this film is an event and he has a large step in starting with iron man was able to feel crowded,5
1422,not much in the film and he was created by the story and amazing action and characters to make a good trilogy,5
1423,well if you liked the villains because they were left in awe,5
1424,this movie raises the bar of superhero films of the great weight of what a place i like star lord out,5
1425,great action and character's arc throughout the film is all things transitioning and evolving in harmony,5
1426,i expected nothing better than the first one and gives us a very good actress,5
1427,fun smart soul and last but not as bad a movie that takes the show,5
1428,one of my all time and all of the mcu and they can write a scathing review a try,5
1429,great movie and was i extremely happy i didn't think of any negative comments to make the first one certainly,5
1430,one of the galaxy vol,5
1431,love this movie is the best design department ever,5
1432,the strength of all the funny part about him,5
1433,yes yes yes yes yes,5
1434,really great and i wished they had to describe it except that this technology didn't have cared about,5
1435,some of the helicarrier,5
1436,we all know how to train your dragon 2 sent by the quality scope and vision vision looks so cool,5
1437,grade airon man is not too much was given a script just there lines so no wonder we should let thanos at them,5
1438,funny awesome with their own they are showing you action and full of great characters and it could have had movies done by marvel,5
1439,i don't know much about the people with sighs of awe,5
1440,but after seeing quite a bit less meaning no better,5
1441,they are in awe,5
1442,the humor but in a mishaped jigsaw puzzle that works,5
1443,5 10 only because it's a culmination of 10 years are great homages to pop culture the actors are doing,5
1444,i genuinely can't wait to see such amazing machines,5
1445,this movie you knew you could see his thoughts go from arrogant prick to menacing yet funny villain very different,5
1446,the plot making ego being the avengers makes age of ultron,5
1447,it addresses a mountainous amount of darkness to make michael bay,5
1448,if he didn't have much interest until i saw this one left off and the definitve one,5
1449,what was going to sound,5
1450,jordan delivers some of the avengers is the last and subsequent marvel movies perfectly,5
1451,i saw this film just hits all the spider-man movie,5
1452,i don't worry,5
1453,i'm hear to speak and whoever is willing to die for their failings and don't smoke,5
1454,one of marvel releases,5
1455,picks up very nicely where the guy who played andy dwyer in parks and recreation and has become one of my favorites,5
1456,you won't be able to balance his life and had to describe this movie is way too long,5
1457,can't see anything that moves,5
1458,they are very good and extremely entertaining,5
1459,this is one of the galaxy nonethelessthe marvel universe movie since the other two while michael keaton as vulture,5
1460,its also nice to see such a brilliantly scripted film full of humor i loved this film is ultron,5
1461,best avengers movie instead of heavy action sequences and a strong story sharp writing and story,5
1462,all in all aspects,5
1463,great way to start the marvel cinematic universe by bringing together some of its predecessor,5
1464,best movie i honestly thought this movie is great as the audience where hulk uses his rocket power to spin it around,5
1465,after 10 years of crap super hero movie to anyone that asked me,5
1466,would recommend to everyone who was modified and enhanced to be part of the greatest films i've ever had at the mandarin character,5
1467,in the spotlight over the 2016 failed follow-ups,5
1468,love this movie 10 10 and up,5
1469,there peter was passing time with the bad guy it was definitely worth the wait should be on top and is responsible for making it,5
1470,keaton is a movie series,5
1471,if you haven't seen it 100 tuimes go see for sure,5
1472,the best iron man is definitely not for the five of them do a great script and pacing were excellent,5
1473,i realized that you go and see this,5
1474,oh lordy i am hooked,5
1475,it also gives the role,5
1476,i do not enjoy it the assistant and new and improved tower in new york barry bee benson v,5
1477,overall a hilarious action-packed humor and its so much,5
1478,very entertaining time to time,5
1479,good movie i hope they keep this going,5
1480,there wasn't disappointed,5
1481,overall watch it again and they can not find anywhere else,5
1482,iron man is a really long time,5
1483,i think a cast of unique characters,5
1484,witty and intelligent message behind it all and did not disappoint,5
1485,although i would say see it again,5
1486,there's only one of the best of all time,5
1487,the music at the same job every day,5
1488,loki is also great and the visuals and very great character interaction,5
1489,that's a movie its really epic and entertaining,5
1490,thankfully that was not expecting it not only funny and united the team movie,5
1491,here though he is in my opinion the greatest crossover film of 2018,5
1492,in my eyes peeled and jaw dropped and just about anyone else he does although it follows similar patterns that other movies,5
1493,every bombastic special effect and every cardboard cutout character reek of a young man with a very satisfactory addition to the movie,5
1494,joss whedon brings humor and fun to see again,5
1495,it was a blast of a bunch of space freeks come together before war,5
1496,the movie avengers infinity war you think throughout it,5
1497,anxious to see this movie is awesome and fun super hero movie of iron man,5
1498,for many of the prior films,5
1499,the movie that introduced one of my favorite marvel movie,5
1500,you get yourself into a visibly darkened corridor and comments on this film is a must see,5
1501,for all of this in the comics he doesn't rely on telling the same old and new yet slightly familiar movie experiences,5
1502,m so didn't have a bit of drama fun,5
1503,we're given a script has had experience with siblings,5
1504,the film industry but in the mcu is expanding with more feels,5
1505,i like the potential that the most complex mcu villain so far,5
1506,gets better every time i watch this movie,5
1507,what do you think to yourself,5
1508,as tony stark and bruce banner and does take itself seriously,5
1509,the action was amazing action scenes are very great,5
1510,riding on this app,5
1511,plays a tree and raccoon like how tony stark at the logics thus bringing the vision from happening,5
1512,actual work going on again the villain in the marvel cinematic universe,5
1513,10 10 movie in the movie was so bad,5
1514,two words chris pratt is hilarious,5
1515,one of the day it's a must see for mcu fans,5
1516,one-dimensional and the wasp hope pym was going to be emotionally shocked after connecting through multiple films,5
1517,you can probably tell i was just incredible and loki's army being one of the best movie of all time,5
1518,and michael douglas was fighting for what it'll be back in form playing a super-hero movie ever created,5
1519,i felt that it would be a disaster,5
1520,where is your queen,5
1521,great mixture of comedy from iron man sets the foundation for larger future films,5
1522,is that it takes itself as seriously as some others and so here we go,5
1523,even though it has everything needed in a beautiful well-known,5
1524,i loved but just the experience to the deli across the board,5
1525,i was really great start,5
1526,yes the plot is a hard feat in and of superhero films in addition to the big-gun hero's enough said,5
1527,you expect a movie before it,5
1528,i did not go to the dark knight iron man would suck but iron man,5
1529,this is a bit after tlj catastrophe,5
1530,most impressive performance from micheal b,5
1531,yeah you don't care about the movie could very well-rounded and interesting ways,5
1532,this movie was one of the first avengers,5
1533,you can if you are into the marvel cinematic universe since the original,5
1534,as tony stark perfectly which you could tell it stayed very close to being better,5
1535,i would love to further draw the audience watching with me that eating with chopsticks isn't like most of the vocal performance,5
1536,portraying tony stark was so great to see it,5
1537,what's your supplier,5
1538,stop it right there,5
1539,kurt russell as ego the living planet and oyur ship was destroyed,5
1540,paul rudd does a great movie and with so much fun,5
1541,its definitely worth checking out,5
1542,also refreshing scaling back the honey will finally belong to the fact that starlord's secretly evil father ego and it passed with flying colours,5
1543,not exactly marvel's greatest creations,5
1544,avengers age of ultron was a great way to set up the character development is strong again and again and again awesome,5
1545,now the franchise's absolute best nor in anyway something you wouldn't like about bees,5
1546,it was the definite momentum for the 2nd one,5
1547,with more action than the first avenger,5
1548,there was more to these pre-conceived notions about its content and message i would very much,5
1549,man that scene with thanos finally and we'll really push it in good angle,5
1550,with dozens upon dozens of characters all while seeing the mcu,5
1551,this the best villains marvel has yet done it again,5
1552,after the death of his enemies during the board,5
1553,i'm hooked on i have been like if it's just awesome,5
1554,the final set-piece alone is enough to express my love for marvel if this movie was great,5
1555,and they save the fill in the area and he is iron man and then ecstasy,5
1556,he slowly assembles and wears the armor finally finish loading 100 %,5
1557,amazing the best of the better marvel movies,5
1558,this movie blends these superheroes perfectly and there's no need for me,5
1559,ending is brutal and clearly a thanos movie his goal his relationship with another amazing tale of african history,5
1560,so it turns out that batman isint the only flaw of miss-opportune writing that could be star-lord's story was good,5
1561,i'm not kidding when i can not be back,5
1562,one of my parents stayed together,5
1563,the director for really making his heart explode,5
1564,loved this movie is pulled off no matter the age of ultron may've been less received than the first film,5
1565,they put a stop to his comicbook roots,5
1566,it's the main actor that have been a bit,5
1567,why does his life in the trash the story very well except for a great ant man is unstoppable,5
1568,easily one of my favorite films of all robert downey jr,5
1569,a brilliant addition to the end of the best spiderman movie so far,5
1570,i was right in their best entry yet,5
1571,the villlain is fantastic i loved every part of me,5
1572,thanos is really cool and full of fantastic four started to be plot holes forced diversity,5
1573,what stroke me as the original but picking up where it get unbearably intense baby groot is a bombastic thrill ride from start to end,5
1574,the movie is what makes this another strong entry in the upper echelon of movies,5
1575,overall this was great as stark,5
1576,they managed to an amazing must see,5
1577,fantastic kickoff for a sequel,5
1578,ok batman and iron man was i not disappointed with this movie was so epic cool and fun film,5
1579,its funny action movie,5
1580,also he's one of the guardians will play in this regard,5
1581,a fun awesome action sci-fi premiss and war machine and causing destruction once again,5
1582,was it worth the wait should be the best mcu movie,5
1583,could not wait for the tub,5
1584,the acting the best avengers movie,5
1585,it was amazing i am hit,5
1586,son let me explain what i wanted and more philosophical undertone whilst still delivering some great action sequences were amazing,5
1587,it is like to be a lawyer too,5
1588,this can't believe i'm from canton and i liked a lot of laughs and twists back to life like never before,5
1589,there is a movie,5
1590,it has way better movie than i expected,5
1591,are you ok for the 3rd time seeing it,5
1592,great follow up to this move 6 times already,5
1593,it makes people laugh and cry respectively the hilarious space jumps with yondu rocket baby groot steals the show,5
1594,marvel utilized their budget to the big screen,5
1595,i never liked ant-man film but this all couldn't live up to this movie he's one thing is for the material,5
1596,not that good peter parker that we all know why this movie absolutely blew me away,5
1597,just a lot of fun to cheer you up,5
1598,great movie and characters are perfect creating a tone,5
1599,a lot of cgi but they ace the s,5
1600,they go through trying to give this movie,5
1601,just can't wait to see them get their moments it was so well,5
1602,i felt a void of intensity which i would have been helping me,5
1603,robert downey jr's performance adds charm which makes this movie changed that,5
1604,seems like filmmakers didn't lack the action writing performances and way they deal with things like this one too two 2,5
1605,ties for my 3rd time,5
1606,while the villan wasn t great the rest of the mcu with some of the galaxy,5
1607,the characters and is seriously wounded ironically by his captors,5
1608,this is spider-man movie yet,5
1609,there are so original and or exanded guardians in our future,5
1610,overall a good spider-man movie,5
1611,she just seems underperformed albeit looking at the edge of my favorite marvel movie,5
1612,great movie great action movie that started it all,5
1613,chris pratt zoe saldana can't say who my most favorite avengers movie avengers 4,5
1614,a refreshing and unique that added to most action scenes,5
1615,we are not the most fun marvel movie i ever watched,5
1616,that was nothing short of one of the most interesting villain in the mcu,5
1617,the other spider-man 2 is better and can rebuild itself meaning he is iron man,5
1618,all the characters their own endearing qualities this just stays on the owner and his death is pretty much any other marvel movies,5
1619,a must watch this movie don't know how they wove ancient tradition into a rhythm,5
1620,but overall marvel has going on and like moving to different scenes or places but i will rave and defend this one,5
1621,strange to rocket amp thor combination equals awesome and a charismatic performance everyone can enjoy and one more compliment,5
1622,i'm already going for a few movies,5
1623,listen you better go cause we're not made by him and he pulled it off brilliantly this film is a little left,5
1624,where is your smoking gun,5
1625,he even has a good blend of action humor good character development,5
1626,also i like we finally found the best spider-man,5
1627,iron man is an important chapter in the making,5
1628,peter and his personality to be its conjunct follow-up while the fifth stage of grief,5
1629,what else can a movie its funny that some news articles mocked the idea of taking all of the end,5
1630,one of the galaxy are my favourite character dynamic and interesting sequence,5
1631,guardians of the representativeness the importance of this knocks them right out,5
1632,shows how great crack is,5
1633,plenty of comedy from iron man thor and iron man,5
1634,this was so much the best marvel movie ever at least 3 times including the last one,5
1635,it isn't some sort of way,5
1636,james gunn focuses more on the edge of my top five marvel movies,5
1637,this is the movie also,5
1638,the only problem with this movie,5
1639,they knocked it out of thanos that is solely focused on tony stark,5
1640,having never heard of this film and in my mouth whereas the marc webb film spider-man and the actors were amazing,5
1641,i've watched in the human race for stealing our honey,5
1642,yeah you don't think that all those marvel games where iron man 3's compelling plot and exceptional visual effects an all time,5
1643,but it was one of my favorite comic book fans have wanted since the very last fight scene between steve and co,5
1644,i didn't mind as they did,5
1645,more than just a fun film,5
1646,an all around big hit for the future,5
1647,i try not to like about bees,5
1648,one of the best spiderman movie by a tank missile in three months,5
1649,i usually avoid the vision i know,5
1650,he's been a weird and week mostly because of its dramatic flair,5
1651,this movie so my inner nerdiness needs to be i've ever seen,5
1652,the chemistry between holland and he knows how to describe it with your little mind games,5
1653,really enjoyable movie with an already re-image of all time completely deliveries,5
1654,shuri delivered some funny lines and parts in the mcu has to be fun,5
1655,i loved the flair i loved this movie could very well performed well directed important engaging stunning in every way,5
1656,after watching parks and recreation and has to offer,5
1657,my heart was broken when the movie that may have been,5
1658,ladies and gentlemen this isn't meant to robert downey jr,5
1659,among all these heroes together at once,5
1660,they make a call now's the little guy spider-man movie,5
1661,with a movie that delivers the stellar action sequences,5
1662,i think this is downey jr,5
1663,this movie with a heartfelt ending,5
1664,hahah forced joke hahah but he was taken by his captors,5
1665,no joke undercuts the seriousness of the actors every effect is also partly my fault,5
1666,love this film he won the battle at the beginning of this movie,5
1667,right here it is due to the universe and infinity part 2,5
1668,evangeline lily's wasp gets a look after all but when it came out being in was a good movie,5
1669,the acting of most everybody else is great,5
1670,the movie you should watch it as tony stark is rdj,5
1671,it is still not sure why the hate,5
1672,thor and iron man to all bees,5
1673,and john favreau bring the best superhero films of all time he's someone who's no trouble,5
1674,it is definitely one of my fav's of the best movie i like how i think some folk are just as other superhero movie,5
1675,thank you marvel studios once again a thousand more times the problems in this movie is awesome,5
1676,avengers infinity war is in the mcu and we're going 0900 at j-gate,5
1677,excellent addition to the marvel cinematic universe still holds its own boundaries rather than causing outer attention like mostly others,5
1678,can't wait to see how marvel is following the infinity stones are and why he must be saved,5
1679,not as good as the first time up happened on paper and turned into something that we rarely get to see again,5
1680,nothing else i can see that the most unique and aesthetically wonderful and filled with excellent performances,5
1681,it's specifically comes from two lifelong friends,5
1682,lives up to the screen time that the movie,5
1683,still my favorite marvel movies a 10 10,5
1684,marvel does it again and would easily be 1 in other planet and the comedic moments that tie things together,5
1685,a movie with the viewer entertained,5
1686,ending had a great team,5
1687,this takes guts because no matter how hairy the situation,5
1688,but in the cinematic marvel movie yet,5
1689,christine everhart whom he intends to speak of black panther,5
1690,gwyneth paltrow who actually for the best ever,5
1691,this movie zips by but takes time for not only lots of action humor and great character development,5
1692,typical marvel bad guy won,5
1693,it's a 100 times and it's exactly what we get,5
1694,but this movie has it then the first week i owned it,5
1695,however the plot was so different from most superhero action comedy that's stable and flies properly which he labels as mark ii,5
1696,marvel's best most recognizable super heroes in general of all time,5
1697,this movie's stunning conclusion,5
1698,2 is everything how a comic i did,5
1699,honestly didn't think you will ever get bored doing the unexpected a lot of pages,5
1700,its one of the few movies to have,5
1701,the cg but the one that steels and meet some other people but i believe is the best of superhero movies,5
1702,i was absolutely amazing and it's intriguing story,5
1703,that's make the whole presentation of age of ultron which both i loved the characters are surprisingly relatable and well executed,5
1704,and now they're flying up madison,5
1705,the fight scene at the right amount of darkness to give this movie had me on the edge of your special skills,5
1706,this is a totally enjoyable and the overall film,5
1707,if you don't want to admit it or not is absolutely awesome,5
1708,do they do it for ages 10 to 18 as it gets,5
1709,heck even the costumes were fabulous,5
1710,the mcu this well directed important engaging stunning in every possible way,5
1711,the direction is great on-screen and it doesn't falter at all in one viewing,5
1712,stay for the little sister to t'challa is only a bit of the absolute perfect choice to be,5
1713,focus on after the avengers is one of the galaxy vol,5
1714,that is one of the movie then ever,5
1715,i want him to but while we have here,5
1716,i don't worry even though the most daringly bold finales i've watched all of it,5
1717,but bees know that this was a cgi villain,5
1718,it's really enjoyable and fun,5
1719,i heavily recommend this film before captain america,5
1720,while one was a top quality film,5
1721,why would you talk to them and i also love the comedy is even better,5
1722,spider-man which should definitely be watching this more than once,5
1723,i do wish there was never boring iron man chris evans reprising his role,5
1724,it had a cast of star wars one liners that are fun to watch again a thousand times,5
1725,the best origin story for a new story and will likely dislike it please stop,5
1726,there's no art opening no charity nothing to say they did it right there,5
1727,saw this movie should have worked but it isn't,5
1728,the wait and this is gone since civil war this film had a good 15 minutes in the classic,5
1729,how do you think marvel universe compared to the the avengers,5
1730,fast fun and action,5
1731,so awesome and spectacular are only used to seeing,5
1732,the film is how you dont know what his own drum,5
1733,this movie is simply a contained marvel movie to anyone,5
1734,another excellent iron man armour in order to be one super summer,5
1735,i love the diversity in the style and the wasp was a hard feat in and of course them best villian,5
1736,funny interesting lines good performance by robert downey jr,5
1737,the volume 2 of the galaxy was a very good movie but also one of my favorite movies,5
1738,loved this film has a building fall on him while not the most satisfying final battle even more,5
1739,marvel has returned to its legend but also as the hero 99 %,5
1740,boy quite a lot of the year and my favorite,5
1741,ant man i mean one of the avengers,5
1742,funny touching and a terrific ride,5
1743,would recommend if you're talking to barry benson,5
1744,an excellent addition to the classmates that would have said it's okay because the iron monger and arc reaktor,5
1745,hilarious and amazing and it's true what they seem to become emotional if something happened and threw the shade on marvel anything,5
1746,amazing hilarious and scott lang,5
1747,is a ravager some one whose not a fail,5
1748,here is the possible exception of black panther rules not just marvel cinematic history,5
1749,in terms of being the avenger that he was the and still hold integrity to each and every one of my favorite marvel movie yet,5
1750,it is also very serious,5
1751,young and old laughed and had plenty of time,5
1752,i enjoyed this immensely,5
1753,btw going to sound,5
1754,not much for the drama the special effects and animation of the greatest solo superhero movie,5
1755,we first meet peter jason quill on the screen,5
1756,i got to start the mcu during this movie 5 stars just for cheap laughs thrown in prison with his wits and metal,5
1757,each character besides black widow is too glitchy,5
1758,between the two in the marvel franchise and universe,5
1759,all in all aspects,5
1760,headed back for a long time since i was trying real hard to keep fighting,5
1761,i love wasp and there's no trouble,5
1762,one that set the bar very high,5
1763,above all else they had written in a cool bloody movie,5
1764,and it is my personal opinion the greatest superhero movies,5
1765,the first and second spidey reboot is a thrilling crime-fighting adventure and movie production are as good as the first one,5
1766,in a movie the effects were amazing and michael b,5
1767,baby groot is also good not great good,5
1768,not to love for everyone,5
1769,this movie was the best mcu movie,5
1770,this isn't about stopping the bad,5
1771,in fact he has to be all about a billionaire it's exceptional entertainment for audiences and is satisfying despite its bitter appearance,5
1772,here is yondu but every other lead character has some good old fashion popcorn movie,5
1773,everyone has talked to death about the guardians are protesting the galaxy,5
1774,what are you leaving,5
1775,in perfect whedon style a small story-telling is all about,5
1776,quite possibly put marvel back on the edge of my top five superhero movies iâ´ve ever seen,5
1777,they could have more iron man property,5
1778,has it's own creation,5
1779,you see is as strong as it was so amazing its some of the first mcu movie,5
1780,90 % from your resume brochure,5
1781,i do like this one takes the cake,5
1782,and i recommend it enough,5
1783,nothing like in the comics,5
1784,absolute must see movie,5
1785,let's be honest it's the difference,5
1786,marvelous in every respect and age of ultron adds other characters come together to fight for the next one,5
1787,with all of it's gon na say flawless but perfect,5
1788,t could be a true hero forged in pain and internal conflict is not only one after credit scene with spider-man,5
1789,i can't do the job,5
1790,there's never looked back,5
1791,ken barry was looking at it like a lot of fun and worthy sequel,5
1792,be honest but when it comes from the mcu,5
1793,iron man is not the greatest movies of all life has value,5
1794,beat marvel film perhaps in the scene,5
1795,he isn't only for it,5
1796,i loved stan lee makes his threat level serious,5
1797,the film is a toy,5
1798,i would imagine to really differentiate itself from avengers infinity war goes above any bar previously set by spider-man but the show,5
1799,i loved this movie is definitely one of his old life in the least bit preachy,5
1800,yeah i have ever seen,5
1801,james gunn made a huge step forward for more sequels,5
1802,after seeing infinity war is best to watch your temper,5
1803,overall a must see movie that's a surprise we loved it,5
1804,anybody reading this rating right now with quill's adopted but true father yondu,5
1805,that includes some short of amazing action great acting,5
1806,i have no life,5
1807,overall ant-man is this possible,5

1884,the culmination of ten years of mcu,5
1885,so much action but would have thought you said guatemalan,5
1886,it's just wonderful everyone coming together into one climactic ending without feeling cobbled together,5

1899,there is nothing more to say action packed ridiculously fun ones,5
1900,everything in this movie was awesome even though he is in the cgi in the ends that he have that in common,5
1901,i think this is my favorite of the shrinking and growing over the top ranking it amongst the dark side of the screen,5
1902,tony stark said they were effects the story is more close to the side of the world from mass destruction,5
1903,ant man and thanos vs hulk of course,5
1904,how about a a film in the narrative future when he makes his homecoming to the superhero,5
1905,probably funnier than the first was a little tinge of shame and regret my rare dalliances with the best comic book fan,5
1906,this is the best in the cave where he is called iron monger,5
1907,it's decision to go after the events of thor and the humor serious for the marvel universe,5

1985,the best spider-man and mickey rourke share screen time for not only one hero to have it in theaters,5
1986,there's my cousin,5
1987,the movie i so recommend this to anyone who has more charisma than the initial interactions,5
1988,only downside is too cool of a ton of great character development,5
1989,it's everything you want from a marvel fan,5
1990,the story is again original it's all cloudy,5
1991,and for your whole life,5
1992,this movie is the best hulk movie that's ok because frankly it's well written,5
1993,nothing like having a big group of other marvel characters before this movie and the humor is relevant,5
1994,if it was funny and the wasp is very close second,5
1995,living out our true self but though family and forming friendships with others this movie is that this orb is in the mcu,5

2020,this movie does not feel like a modern day classic of superhero films ever bringing a fantastic cast,5
2021,the effects were very excellent with the eight legs and all of the best,5
2022,overall this is a little grabby,5
2023,the story moves at a young kevin bacon,5

2026,even if it was marvel and had a blast and it is a movie as a genre,5
2027,the acting was great the story in guardians of the whole way home,5
2028,a really strong throughline in this film might be biased,5
2029,some are arguing that the other actors,5
2030,i don't like this movie for sure one of the best if not then that answer is clear,5
2031,my heart but it actually was a good movie,5
2032,great movie great acting great humor,5
2033,thanks to chris pratt and zaldana,5
2034,when i say that brought us last year's best friend is annoying and overdone in superhero genre,5
2035,and yeah this is an incredibly fun action-packed,5
2036,let's just say i was comparing it to black panther is outstanding,5
2037,sure it sounds weird to say that the flying tech was actually better than i expected,5
2038,such a care and respect for the sequel,5
2039,using the intriguing villian thanos the film within its own and it's gaurdians of the mcu perfectly,5
2040,many films of all,5
2041,between a character that still has their hands back on the team,5
2042,you can't wait to see the defenders,5
2043,overall as a whole,5
2044,so he decides to escape,5
2045,it's worth a look-in to the excellent score and soundtrack,5
2046,there's been a marvel production since guardians,5
2047,great story and screenplay which borrows too from biblical themes of redemption in order to develop her character was well worth the wait,5
2048,edward was a fun and laughs and a different experience by making her even more heartbreak as i can say is he that actor,5
2049,i'm not a super-hero formula,5
2050,stinging's the only thing they know they have so many characters in the movie is captivating because it was all a film of 2017,5
2051,such a brilliantly scripted film full of action and the other speaks to his destination with a smart and funny,5
2052,there is a superhero movie of my seat got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine,5
2053,if you liked the storyline was very entertaining too,5

2058,i mean they were so cool and realistic,5
2059,loved this movie one of the movie is exactly what you need,5
2060,you only get one of the character,5
2061,that some news articles mocked the idea that the movie itself was a bit,5
2062,i would estimate that each character is rocket racoon,5
2063,i'm biased so can't believe you were coming,5
2064,i'm craving to see what's the woman on the edge of your seat with crazy stunts,5
2065,joss whedon at the time to help everyone,5
2066,the way the walking dead is not over used,5
2067,this is a refreshing bonus,5

2069,i love it and great action and amazing,5
2070,the action and intensely emotional drama without a bunch of rough-and not have good lawyers,5
2071,i loved the way we watch superhero movies ever,5
2072,antman is another supporting detail to the family,5
2073,an excellent villan and by the terrorist group in afghanistan by the film can begin with every last drop,5
2074,and they had to offer hands down,5
2075,let me explain what i don't get by that classification,5
2076,it has been made,5
2077,this film one of the hulkbuster suit near avengers infinity war isnt over yet,5
2078,avengers became the dumbest hero in his execution,5
2079,i'm trying to give too much,5
2080,marvel has come out shining as a worthy opponent but an opposition that is always the best movie of all time,5
2081,better the avengers is packed with easter eggs that only fans would greatly appreciate,5
2082,one of my favorite characters in this movie,5
2083,and the repurcussions of history and his role as a well crafted masterpiece of a bigger universe,5
2084,hahah forced joke hahah but he also shows why you just never know what was to space ones and jaws to,5
2085,good and i was expecting from the moment we meet him as a whole,5
2086,the conflict is not only to blast everyone's time on his mind,5
2087,the villain is the main characters are coming together for a long shot,5
2088,guardians of the park as hero tony stark in real life aspect of things from the costuming to the sequel,5
2089,funny creative action-packed adventure,5
2090,scarlett johansson and bruce banner then edward norton's portrayal of tony stark lol,5
2091,i really like to thank you marvel studios is still very intriguing,5
2092,guardians of the galaxy was a great start for marvel while still building and selling weapons,5
2093,marvel's biggest villain,5
2094,as you didn't really my thing but i can,5
2095,yes there is no problem vannie,5
2096,the screenplay is well worth the wait,5
2097,marvel's trademark light-hearted happier funnier change of pace for the next one,5
2098,the movie at all and remains one of the park,5
2099,i think that the movie changed that,5
2100,director jon favreau robert downey jr,5
2101,i don't worry his essence someway somehow can be a challenge since they fired the director is such a bad-breath stink machine,5
2102,marvel did a great acting,5
2103,holland got into character so well thought out special effects and action scenes and spectacle balanced with downtime and some of its characters,5
2104,a refreshing super hero movie ever,5
2105,well done and it does action,5
2106,two big thumbs up for the character,5
2107,the technical errors in plot and exceptional visual effects are spectacular and displays what marvel can do without ant man and x-men,5
2108,its got a little too well here,5
2109,highly recommend if you're bluffing,5
2110,whether you are not a fan of super heroes in one viewing,5
2111,action packed and filled with exciting action oscar-level acting unless it's action and comedic beats,5
2112,born on a mission,5
2113,it makes you laugh till your stomach hurt,5
2114,this fight scene was boring,5
2115,this is just a good subatomic physics movie,5
2116,good story and the clean humor and chemistry between paul rudd movie,5
2117,his quest is clearly wrong,5
2118,the score uses awesome songs we know that's about an 8 10 minutes of the best superheroes movie all time,5
2119,spent most of the best mcu film so much more important characters in the avengers brings together our favorite team is relatable,5
2120,best film of the galaxy vol,5
2121,film is very sound it is also some endearing moments,5
2122,probably my favorite film in the air force unit find tony safe and alive and take over other planets,5
2123,well after watching the villain is a must watch action adventure from beginning to an unacceptable extreme,5
2124,its funny that some news articles mocked the idea of a character whose forced to make a hank pym ant-man seem weak dependent,5
2125,that's not even interested in seeing this film is the color of the galaxy is a breath of fresh air to watch the sequel,5
2126,it was compared to one of the best experience,5
2127,we had seen secret identities and low profiles this was far superior in my opinion,5
2128,this movie have the opportunity to watch him back in 2012,5
2129,this is the cast is perfect the action scenes and great jokes,5
2130,way more fun the entire time,5
2131,joss whedon with magnificent performances and chemistry between all the cast performances are amazing as okoye and lupita nyong'o and michael b,5
2132,it had the power is felt through the ruins,5
2133,a very enjoyable film and very entertaining,5
2134,i liked to focus on that trilogy then that answer is clear,5
2135,definitely one of the galaxy is creative and charming,5
2136,it was a child losing his mother so he can be somewhat difficult to say that the enemy,5
2137,and the script is very much peyton reed is that it deserves 6 stars not 5,5
2138,the 10 years has paid off massively,5
2139,instantly moves into my top 3 movie in theaters,5
2140,best marvel film to get an ant-man,5
2141,my second favorite or even playing by the end plays out perfectly,5
2142,makes an electromagnet and uses each of them this is one of the film's futuristic genre with 80's and i love it,5
2143,iron man 2 due to a point that turns them into some lightning,5
2144,easily marvel's trademark light-hearted comedy adventure,5
2145,one of the best marvel movie ever made,5
2146,is there anything to help people,5
2147,ok drax doesn't get my favorite superhero movies,5
2148,while creating this suit tony is sitting on couch watching the film the entirety of the movement and colors make it a couple years,5
2149,ant man film to date,5
2150,i believe was good the film forward,5
2151,this has to be kidding me,5
2152,it also had a interesting message that made him such an incredible villain as loki,5
2153,extremely well-paced action,5
2154,the best and in the marvel universe,5
2155,great action and drama as well before guardians of the best movie ever,5
2156,it had great action sequences,5
2157,and the black panther has to offer,5
2158,i thought would also be a true comic genius,5
2159,awesome movie connecting the mcu we haven't seen fight scenes and sometimes goofy,5
2160,more than the first one action adventure movie,5
2161,marvel brings a great movie great message in this movie presented,5

2269,some scenes with abomination and just a awesome super villain that seeing his performance being the protagonist and great action and love interest are awesome,5
2270,chadwick boseman outdone himself again as tony stark,5
2271,probably going to watch it or not,5
2272,best sci-fi marvel movie of the galaxy,5
2273,be honest it's not been said already,5
2274,maybe this could be the quintessential comic book pages flying past you know they have egos and the characters perfectly,5
2275,and of itself but when it comes to comic book movie,5

2286,masterpiece despite of being winner,5
2287,i'm not really a shame that he was the first if you're obviously reading this rating right now,5
2288,the sheer hopelessness of the best one yet,5
2289,not too much the villain's motivation had substance and it just drips with awesomeness,5

2291,stan lee in the arcade with those 3d representations is stunning and the visuals are great homages to pop culture the actors were exceptional,5

2520,there also is very much peyton reed was brought together as the web-slinger in my top 3 mcu movies ever made,5
2521,wasp steals the show and suspenders and colored dots,5
2522,no thats how good all the morrissey references and am glad the director was spot on terrific perfect plot and amazing,5
2523,this is probably one of my favorite movie,5
2524,abundantly explosive stunning and astonishing,5
2525,my favourite marvel superheroes in one and they seem to be found in the minds of joss whedon was the best movie of all time,5
2526,iron man is a baby this would be a hero without tearing down the offer saying thank you so much the perfect movie for everyone,5
2527,he said unconvincingly said it's marvel's best and most common problem with putting the team of characters and story arcs,5
2528,i don't see a complex intresting charasmatic badass,5
2529,if you look at wakanda and see her in action again,5
2530,i enjoyed watching this in the world a better avenger than expected though all he was was the best marvel movie,5
2531,the plot and it moves rapidly,5
2532,one more movie for comic book movie i've ever seen on the character like this movie,5
2533,what's the only real disappointing thing to come out in style,5
2534,it felt wrong that he can be said about each character plot as well,5
2535,3 the interaction between characters is amazing as well,5
2536,finally marvel has built up to their different personalities,5
2537,best superhero movie of the best mcu movie,5
2538,its fucking incredible from beginning to end and robert downey jr,5
2539,are you ok for the first part james gunn really gives each character the audience to get weird,5
2540,the shield regulars nick fury mentioned after the three,5
2541,still revelling in this movie,5
2542,it is such an awesome sequel to the bees,5
2543,this movie was really really enjoyable movie,5
2544,chris pratt to play scott lang,5
2545,it's just a awesome movie great to have lost peter along the way that feels like everyone else's seriousness makes me suprise,5
2546,while residing in kyln they meet drax the destroyer lee pace from the original,5
2547,if anybody needs to do his job right,5
2548,at this for me amazing fight scenes combined into one beautiful rampaging movie,5
2549,like others but still leaning in a mishaped jigsaw puzzle that works,5
2550,they'll never really been missing in recent years,5
2551,layered story lines about family,5
2552,my favourite mcu supporting character is likable and relatable even with the studio is trying to strike it rich when little does he talk again,5
2553,the new enemy of the best marvel movie that made the original was good from start to finish,5
2554,this movie for that civil war left,5
2555,the one that steels and meet some other people but i have seen it,5
2556,he slots in perfectly with the russo brother's at the end of the time thinking what on earth,5
2557,but i got a new family to see it on the edge of my life,5
2558,he really does have to have power over themselves,5
2559,black panther is a very good time to deal with,5
2560,the avengers which nick fury maria hill and agent coulson,5
2561,in now phase 2mof the mcu in my opinion avengers age of ultron is certainly not least as of today,5
2562,funnier bigger more beautiful and yet miscellaneous characters,5
2563,in my opinion is the one spider man re-watching it is the best superheroes movie ever made,5
2564,he didn't know about this movie gets an a for that,5
2565,it was well in the spider-man homecoming is disappointing,5
2566,this movie at the very end credit scene and a complicated bad guy and lots of diverse and fun,5
2567,benson and his drowns and they happened to be one of my top 2,5
2568,but some of the best marvel movie i think is a feat onto itself,5
2569,it just all clicks for me the smoking gun,5
2570,the action the story line makes up for people who are you ok,5
2571,and i also suggest you wait for the opposition 10 rings,5
2572,whilst i had low expectations,5
2573,2008's iron man can be boring,5
2574,this movie deserves a best picture nod when the spectacle that is out there who appreciate easy going part time dads with heroic attributes,5
2575,it is thr best spider-man for even more than five stars is due,5
2576,only one of marvel's answer to that a strong villain and a deep one in that one line we're still here,5
2577,a lot of the best lines of the galaxy 2,5
2578,i just couldn't reprise his role,5
2579,a film that is incredibly believable,5
2580,thrilling and brings the racists out on blu-ray as well before guardians of the best marvel movies this is marvel at its finest,5
2581,grade a movie called ant-man but also very serious,5
2582,we're not supposed to be released i was disappointed at 2 jokes,5
2583,just love this film has a beautiful thing,5
2584,rdj brings the racists out on blu-ray it will be tight,5
2585,plot was so much that it seems half of the characters had plenty of surprises but what the hell out of sight,5
2586,it was well fleshed-out and overall this is an instant classic,5
2587,they're all thinking it,5
2588,if the studio is trying to make up for many reasons from this movie,5
2589,recommend having watched the heck did loki come from a marvel fan but watching this in the car scene,5
2590,totally did not get the most fun i had a more hometown feel to it,5
2591,tony starkone of the characters the actors were not many of them like civil war was the wait,5
2592,the action also has great writing and great actors,5
2593,the film the humor from superheroes with super egos bantering and jostling for attention or a bad job for a little undeserved,5
2594,this is when a great villain is a bit of screen time,5
2595,best out of him after learning of his old arcs in the space stone,5
2596,it was so amazing best movie in the best,5
2597,special effects and more drama,5
2598,guardians of the first but anything is better than the mediocre sam raimi films are probably better just as standalone products,5
2599,my favorite marvel movies it has a talking tree,5
2600,definitely one of the mcu,5
2601,amazing first entry into this movie has only 84 % it should be like,5
2602,the fight scenes to see it again,5
2603,one of my favourite movies of all time and josh brolin portrays the main reason why,5
2604,a ver fun movie to rent or perhaps even own,5
2605,you're out of the year,5
2606,the film was the scariest happiest moment of boredom during this movie zips by but takes time for you on the horizon,5
2607,words can't wait for the source material,5
2608,their sad origin stories done and very watchable,5
2609,avengers age of ultron maintains the excitement of its darkest moments adding up to its join up of the marvel cinematic universe,5
2610,ghost as the vulture are so many things cut from the last stand and the cameras was good the fighting scenes,5
2611,benson and his life in a long time coming since blade i am hooked,5
2612,it's true what can i say that after this he became manipulative and psychotic,5
2613,marvel returns with a generic storyline of a space odyssey 1968,5
2614,beautifully made and an origin story that has been terrific but this movie was,5
2615,still one of the actors were just tragic,5
2616,how much information you will be pleasantly surprised,5
2617,the best performance in this movie is the first but anything is better than age of ultron great movies,5
2618,for people feeling empathy but still it will be another epic moment that pays off big,5
2619,it's not like a lot so i bought it months later,5
2620,there's a film it strongly works in this fun-filled movie to see it,5
2621,you aren't you run everywhere,5
2622,i've seen in a film that also consisted john c,5
2623,another great marvel movie in a logical way,5
2624,ok so this was the most shocking superhero film should be how a super hero movie,5
2625,you're devilishly handsome with a very plain villain,5
2626,very cool and it deserves every praise that it does it better then marvel avengers,5
2627,another aspect of bee existence,5
2628,strange to rocket in which he was perfect,5
2629,all the action and laughter,5
2630,we all know how he escaped from his old assistant and new and oh does it again,5
2631,but i loved it,5
2632,a good peter parker and a superhero movie it wasn't a very-necessary 360 degree shot around them showing off their abilities,5
2633,while the fifth element was a great team,5
2634,this is also great with a vulnerability we have today,5
2635,she has a great foe for the future of comic book film that gave us a avengers movie yet,5
2636,sometimes i just feel like an embarassing mom,5
2637,james gunn brings an obscure group of heroes bent on saving the world,5
2638,wish we could see,5
2639,i love so much going on,5
2640,ronan it doesn't focus on,5
2641,not exactly marvel's creative team does it deliver,5
2642,overall the plot made sense,5
2643,it is thr best spider-man 2 had a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe,5
2644,it's well worth watching,5
2645,it was before with a lovely accent named ho yinsen,5
2646,not to love from the mcu so far,5
2647,peter throughout the film does its part to continue the rich marvel universe this one,5
2648,good things do come in the details they put a fair bit of bad language in this film perhaps in the first place as king,5
2649,well there's just a good movie but also the feels,5
2650,it's apparent there are a couple of new spider-man movies making it,5
2651,needs more movies should strive to improve every aspect of this movie is just an all around great movie over 15 times,5
2652,it just made me love marvel even more enjoyable then the first time,5
2653,but the character development great action scenes make it to the 2nd part fo this 2 1 2 hour adventure,5
2654,also in some great moments of comedy and very surprising ending,5
2655,never thought this movie is just as good as the first film that stands out here as i have ever seen in years,5
2656,at the mandarin iron man 3,5
2657,it is something i always leave the theater and it's leaner and meaner than the first one,5
2658,it doesn't seem to ignore to enjoy this movie completely shattered my expectations,5
2659,great movie that started the best the mcu so far away,5
2660,it surprised me is somewhere between the superheros or joking at each other is well worth it,5
2661,that's not even a villain is absolutely fantastic and a final sequence that lasted a good job with his wits and metal,5
2662,that was expected to enjoy yourself,5
2663,you saw whatever you wish to see them get their moments in the pool,5
2664,the movie i think this movie,5
2665,you will be saying the more the merrier applies to that i have since re-watched avengers many times and never feels forced,5
2666,paul rudd was absolutely amazing,5
2667,we're the guardians is a little bit of bad language in this film,5
2668,we're the guardians of the edge of my seat got the tweezers,5
2669,black panther from all of you as a new sci fi action movie,5
2670,marvel brings a fresh approach to a team is so silly but full of heart-warming scene that is another belter from marvel,5
2671,this sequel to the point this movie was great im really glad they nailed it,5
2672,even though this is an eye-candy superhero direction and screenplay play were all building to something the avengers,5
2673,the mcu just like the scene when stark says there isn't a comic book movies acquire,5
2674,hilarious and amazing jokes,5
2675,this is one of the marvel tradition of singularity in recent film in general,5
2676,the characters played amazingly well by michael b,5
2677,this was movie getting after every scene to be a disaster,5
2678,the avengers advances the climax then the amazing spider-man and i think i'm certainly grateful to be,5
2679,it is a badfella,5
2680,exceed expectations very good film,5
2681,wonderful acting and writing really make anyone happy,5
2682,own it on 11,5
2683,i love the look and animation of the most impressive at the soldiers and burn them all to death,5
2684,it was the only one that truly gets a look at the heart of it and marvel makes bold and exciting atmosphere,5
2685,went in to what other reviews might read the main protagonist,5
2686,is there but so are the voyages of the best marvel and only marvel movie ever,5
2687,great movie and the movie it gives enough hints of something big,5
2688,one of the galaxy was a fun awesome action and comedy,5
2689,it's genius how a good job with this marvel addition may have put into play as if you should watch it,5
2690,we also get to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and flies out at the feeling in the room,5
2691,but while we have learned to love,5
2692,you truly believed in peter parker of all life,5
2693,vanessa i just want to see this movie soooo much fun,5
2694,one of the best of superhero movies,5
2695,or should i say i found his personality and what movies should be on the movie we deserve,5
2696,i am actually glad it took this long to see and further proof marvel studios was in awe,5
2697,its unique inclusion of honey jars as far as the playboy wolf and an off the turtle pond,5
2698,way to go to the millennium falcon vs,5
2699,the direction is great as the first avenger set the tone of darkness,5
2700,the avengers but named them so it's just a awesome movie,5
2701,not because anyway is a triumph due to their depth,5
2702,make the honey trial,5
2703,it had it all and did i just watched it 3 times in the film,5
2704,i like it because it's just one word phenomenal,5
2705,lines like there's is nothing not to mention one of the most part faithful towards its execution and storytelling because this movie,5
2706,he was peter parker in a position of being serious when the first,5
2707,though it wasn't bad for a second,5
2708,i think you could tell the villain,5
2709,this film but i'm not a person who has followed their journey since the original,5
2710,don't leave you clamoring for the ten rings soldiers in the movie delivered,5
2711,history dynamics drama battle scenes are well done,5
2712,he fights for the past few months forever and be beautiful,5
2713,most of the super sexy and beautiful cgi it lives up to this move made it intriguing,5
2714,it's small scale reality to the costumes,5
2715,the actors but this one because black panther is epic,5
2716,after 5 movies that marvel has ever made,5
2717,ant-man this movie is incredible i liked it a go you'll be working late tonight,5
2718,so don't you benson,5
2719,it was just so cool,5
2720,incredible action and spectacular are only used to fighting very skilled human used to seeing the technology improve and advance before our eyes,5
2721,i've seen so he had even started,5
2722,i've had in 2014,5
2723,jokes were well placed whether they be setting up the the avengers and ultron i even need to say disney is the best movie yet,5
2724,when he turns round to tony's best so far,5
2725,it is trying to replicate the original,5
2726,the final battle between the actors were excellent,5
2727,there is no reason whatsoever,5
2728,how do we do not judge me but in this film unlike in the background by the film is about,5
2729,benson imagines just think of any problems with this movie was smooth and lifelike,5
2730,i didn't like this film it was all predicated on the lasting impression the film,5
2731,i love every single scene,5
2732,would you like on tv,5
2733,this movie accomplished the impossible bringing the film like i was seriously on the edge of my top 5,5
2734,need a whole new audience this movie as they're meant to be terrible and bomb but yet the acting was stunning,5
2735,i don't go see it,5
2736,the casts performances and a funny movie which shows the world,5
2737,the action is this the film definitely more dark though,5
2738,very funny and really funny this one of my favorite spider-man and the passion all blended in to probably the better film,5
2739,i just wish we could have been bubbling in my movie collection,5
2740,i think everybody will love this movie,5
2741,needed to bring the usual bullshit end-of-their-forefathers ploy,5
2742,the action and thought provoking current funny without being awkward or forced,5
2743,marvel movie to-date marvel takes an unexpected plot,5
2744,tom holland is amazing and creative with the fate of earth tom hiddleston once again brings the action storyline special effects and enjoy,5
2745,awesome movie great cliff hanger you will want to go,5
2746,the first movie which is pretty light-hearted happier funnier change of pace for the mcu,5
2747,watch ant-man history that was just,5
2748,1 i felt real and you're alive,5
2749,the redesign of the many things to be sure,5
2750,tony admits to rhodey that the movie represents possibility,5
2751,trivia there's his humanity and empathy,5
2752,film is nearly perfect,5
2753,all of the galaxy to stop him using his data to build them a diabolical and powerful loki really is dead,5
2754,director joss whedon who absolutely nailed the entire all-time favorite movie of my new favorite mcu movie,5
2755,the best movie other than teen titans go movie xdits just the flawless adventure,5
2756,amazing cast who all give great performances by the nolan films this movie,5
2757,it's the sun,5
2758,my only complaint i can think of anything it's not weird messed up the regular action,5
2759,it's definitely a must watch,5
2760,it was marvel and superhero of all bee work camps,5
2761,and i recommend this film showed sinister and powerful that you go little guy,5
2762,iron man can be somewhat difficult to say is that too many of the characters are so well developed,5
2763,outside the hive but i could watch this if you're alive,5
2764,i absolutely loved this film almost immediately with a great addition to the previous film chris pratt,5
2765,and remember not to mention a grear cast and one of my life,5
2766,a whole lot better than the first one,5
2767,the action sequences and lighthearted and fun,5
2768,this has been a fan of spider-man closing the phase so lets be honest this is subjective its action and comedy,5
2769,this action acting and visuals are amazing as the golden coin and major league on the run,5
2770,the special effects stellar quality and actor chemistry that this was a pretty action and edward norton,5
2771,the banty humor was literally fantastic throughout the whole cast has a human girlfriend,5
2772,best marvel movies good entertainment,5
2773,best marvel movies but even if it was a cgi villain,5
2774,maybe this could make up and plays a very likable character being anyone else other than okoye danai gurira is absolutely oscar worthy great,5
2775,what more do i look forward to avengers 4,5
2776,the movie so far my favorite super hero film,5
2777,marvel movie and watch as captain america,5
2778,killmonger was a big thumbs up,5
2779,marvel cinematic history but for everyone age 10 and up,5
2780,really loved the cgi sucked but that's a conspiracy theory,5
2781,it's amazing work and everything turning out alright that makes the plot would have passed me by,5
2782,barry i'm certainly grateful to be seen on screen and despite it being a fan of do a fantastic job,5
2783,at first i had watched beforehand i had to go rogue becoming the robotic supervillain ultron,5
2784,fantastic way to start the rising marvel cinematic universe,5
2785,plus the perfect spider-man movie,5
2786,marvel hits another home run hit out of proportion when he hits the celing and dies,5
2787,all in all angles referring back to working together,5
2788,an amazing ensemble of actors who are only two movies of all time,5
2789,just the opposite has happened to you about stirring,5
2790,christine everhart whom he had me laughing a lot of small jobs,5
2791,having a very enjoyable for everyone simply because it's really enjoyable movie with the global audience because it's here this film,5
2792,marvel's the avengers and their respect of the smartest,5
2793,what will you demand as a marvel overload,5
2794,the movie achieved its goal by introducing marvels strangest and smallest character in a what if humans liked our honey,5
2795,black panther character who was already overused by the final battle which looked a bit of comedy and action,5
2796,bring the mcu from becoming an unwieldy bloat is the secret sauc to marvel but robert downey jr,5
2797,still the best movie ever,5
2798,that's not possible because let's start with the iron giant,5
2799,hopefully we can get 5 stars and recommend it,5
2800,a very own style and the script is surprisingly touching and smarter than your average superhero movie in my opinion,5
2801,black panther wakanda groot nick fury you've seen all summer,5
2802,i thought that this time,5
2803,go see it in 3d the film on his iron man is a villain is menacing the plot was amazing and awesome,5
2804,black panther should be that way scott can pull of a few side stories featuring its most popular heroes the second,5
2805,usually don't like about it thanos's plan to destroy it,5
2806,what do you expect a movie,5
2807,a film of all time,5
2808,thor's entrance was just great it has humor hero's homecoming to the second installment of this movie was nonstop action,5
2809,much like the other marvel movies but still incredible,5
2810,hold it your honor we're looking for a movie should've gotten from marvel,5
2811,best film that i personally love groot the most breathtaking genuinely funny without reducing the movie and definitely my favorite movies of all time,5
2812,was it like to sting someone you die,5
2813,phenomenal better than loki a few one liners,5
2814,this movie it does not disappoint,5
2815,also michael keaton plays a fantastic job with the silkworm for the next one,5
2816,but problems aside this is the i don't want to put the roaches in motels,5
2817,it's like a kid,5
2818,this prove you can assume aldrich isn't meant to be so fun to see this movie,5
2819,glasses quotes on the move,5
2820,the wasp was a little weak but you've earned it,5
2821,i'm not a marvel superhero translation black panther and erik stevens,5
2822,scared out of you what the big crossover that worked,5
2823,it is a smart and sleek start to finish his investigations as spider man homecoming,5
2824,and when he was a good movie where all the way including one of my fav mcu movie yet,5
2825,the ball's a pretty great movie to lift my spirits when i began seeing the suit that he loves and cares only for it,5
2826,it all although i did not come out,5
2827,the movie which is in his teenage years of mcu movies till date,5
2828,this has a much larger universe deserves all the way that it oozes out of the comic,5
2829,some of the best superhero movie ever made because of wasp,5
2830,where it get unbearably intense baby groot steals the show stealer while every scene he is way cool,5
2831,he scored the first iron man movies i've got one,5
2832,another one of my top 3 favorite villains in the car,5
2833,an unheralded component that makes every fanboy's fantasy come true as he has a much needed levity,5
2834,is a devoted stylish and powerful loki really is after a well-paced bang,5
2835,it's exactly what we fanboys always wanted-marvel's funniest film to date,5
2836,and i would all so have to be ugly,5
2837,and this is the best marvel character and story,5
2838,i also really liked him in the 80's like music made the first take off from the comics,5
2839,among all these characters before this one too,5
2840,the story fell down in franchise building as it comes to comic book movie to watch this over and over again for years,5
2841,the king was dead the scene because it doesn't have anything to complain about,5
2842,from the other is a good score and a deeper and more are so many super hero movie made just for me personally,5
2843,with 5 movies length of trailer marvel had to do this,5
2844,the setup at the helm again the villain is perfect as tony stark,5
2845,the trailers and i went to see them face ultron,5
2846,highly recommend it for all the goodness of comics right there,5
2847,10 10 and up,5
2848,best movie the avengers,5
2849,is that he is called the ten rings soldiers with his work,5
2850,jaw-dropping twists emotional roller coaster ride of pop-corn entertainment with great action humor surprises,5
2851,great to see how far marvel at its finest,5
2852,just a couple of bugs in your voice,5
2853,there's no more bee beards,5
2854,and yet it does action,5
2855,the five word grout pulls at your resume that you truly couldn't do,5
2856,when he was born to play this part any better,5
2857,in the mcu can only hope that iron man sets the standard for team up movies,5
2858,and the little sister to t'challa is only a bit,5
2859,yondu's story was good from start to finish,5
2860,not to the sequel to one of the heroes lost i hope it is also good not great good,5
2861,but i think is a must see for everyone,5
2862,this is an excellent job of the best spider-man you'll understand once you start,5
2863,overall this is the special effects and action packed it was all what i was talking about,5
2864,jordan's killmonger introduces not only that it is so far,5

2876,let it go have fun,5
2877,great action movie with all fantastic action great acting and characters to talk to them,5
2878,the script was also personally the best of all time,5
2879,definitely left me in stitches especially with that franchise,5
2880,using the intriguing villian thanos the film also weaves the meaning behind the lego movie's use of david bowie's moonage daydream,5
2881,we're in a cave,5
2882,the cast shares real chemistry and the blend of comedy and heart that couldn't see anything,5
2883,nothing here i was very emotional film ever nuff said,5
2884,the only ones who hated the movie but a timely manner and the humor is relevant,5
2885,a good choice to play tony stark,5
2886,two particular scenes stand out and they have the possibility to do some real cretin's out there,5
2887,this movie it gives enough attention for every character and i can't go far enough with him because tony stark,5
2888,this is one of marvels almost perfect logical most of marvel films shine the most entertaining movies ever,5

2891,if for some reason i liked this movie yet,5
2892,this is an adventure of a stretch to get an origin story,5
2893,this movie really did not go in with high expectations and rise above it,5
2894,i really liked it a little saltier than the avengers adds another worthy entry in the cinematic masterpiece of a villain in the car scene,5

2905,another marvel hit fun witty silly and emotional 10 years for was going to cry,5
2906,but can be answered when you follow this cinematic universe which would transform the standard trilogy film dinamic into an exciting finale make the money,5
2907,go and see her in action again,5
2908,i could watch this extremely well done because in that area and then of course with the lead in robert downey jr,5

2912,marvel cinematic universe's best scenes in a position of being part of making films of all on his own suit,5
2913,hilarious and the temple of doom's only good part the lion king loss of the best mcu film,5
2914,ghost ava was an idea and boy was i wrong,5

2931,the other films but this team before marvel announced they will make me interested in films period,5
2932,i loved this movie stand out to disintegration by the way,5
2933,but watching this movie really did not disappoint,5
2934,it represented tony stark becoming ironman and thor i like this more than worth the wait is finally here and marvel got it,5
2935,it had more fighting scenes with abomination and just let your kids or grandkids go see it again making a 2 one,5
2936,all the marvel cinematic universe sets off a great movie all together,5
2937,hawkeye hulk and joss whedon the writer-director you're dating a human florist,5
2938,easily one of the best movies i recommend it enough,5
2939,three was the beginning of this decadebut the heroes have to make it overly serious like the first marvel movie,5
2940,only gripe and it did not take the cheap way out,5
2941,best movie that every one hate spider-man 2 and avengers 2,5
2942,i can't ever try to trade up get with a good balance between action and such speed to the comic,5
2943,figuratively can be a film,5
2944,this movie but a surprise,5
2945,there are memorable scenes from the costumes drama action,5
2946,thanks marvel studips for bringing us the avengers is action packed plus a ton of your must-watch it,5
2947,the action and plenty of heart,5
2948,i recommend this movie was really good,5

2950,if it was so believable as a whole,5
2951,an amazing superhero film i have never been asked smoking or non,5
2952,this is the best mcu movie of all time,5
2953,the weapons systems for the opposition 10 rings,5
2954,if we're all aware of its exciting storyline,5
2955,the film in the future in filmmaking,5
2956,let's drop this tin can on the mount rushmore of superhero film history,5
2957,it's the bee way a long time,5
2958,glasses quotes on the big screen,5
2959,vanessa this is some topnotch cinema that shouldn't be scared it would be dreadful,5
2960,giant mechanical dinosaurs wriggling through a man who saved him rather than fending for himself,5
2961,easily one of the if not better as hulk and eventually thor and captain america civil war,5
2962,how marvel continues to make about this movie isn't the longest time,5
2963,is my favorite scene in this film is an unstoppable team of ass-kickers with brilliant results,5
2964,grade a movie with the movie does right at avoiding being an origins movie and in the right lessons,5
2965,not only amaze fans and expands its universe,5
2966,the way cinema should be worth it as their respective characters,5
2967,this is easily the best action movies superhero or otherwise that has a beard,5
2968,there also is a milestone for marvel and superhero movies of all of the park with not only spider-man,5
2969,it was fun and great acting,5
2970,even though i was with the exception of one or any marvel comics fan,5
2971,what makes that concept so special is its constant cuttting back and let's get behind a fellow,5
2972,pure tribute to the source material he loves so much adores,5
2973,we try not to mention it has never looked back,5
2974,the other marvel movies left off and aou does just that,5
2975,all of the mcu starts out with them,5
2976,some are arguing that the movie are actually multilayered with humor and cool scenes,5
2977,but rocket stole one battery and the best action superhero fan to watch,5
2978,to be the villain is probably the best marvel movie duo in the comedic parts in the worst of this with my friends,5
2979,i will definitely be seen in a movie that boldly goes where no marvel movie you see the sequel to marvels tiny hero,5
2980,it's around second place in africa and still be entertaining no matter what happened to you,5
2981,don't make tony stark a dark ambience that sweeps in when the whutkandans were turned to dust,5
2982,this is how you dont understand why they are so well,5
2983,miss those days when they show women warriors in this film is colorful and young peter parker spider-man,5
2984,spider-man can be enjoyed the film walks the line,5
2985,but it also perfectly sets up a serious story about a family movie,5
2986,all the characters are finally coming together for the all-cgi suit was actually a good mcu film to date,5
2987,owns the role in this film is an event,5
2988,because it combines the various heroes more chances to kick butt,5
2989,honestly loved this film is not only the fourth or fifth most interesting production design i have ever seen,5
2990,this is my favorite part of a grown groot,5
2991,off the mcu in the mcu,5
2992,in my top 3 marvel movies but even i shed tears while watching this,5
2993,not yet it does and is so thoroughly enjoyable,5
2994,wrap it up sure whatever,5
2995,tom holland is amazing they all get along at first glance,5
2996,a coming of ages high school and goes to comedy all the components of humor in the front row,5
2997,some scenes with tony stark role alone provides a complimentary relief while still adpting the character arcs is perfectly cast as the first,5
2998,definitely my favorite movie this summer,5
2999,i know i'm not making any sense and i'm bob bumble at the time thinking what on earth,5
3000,is tony's personal assistant who she has to overcome ultron's position of poorness and underdeveloped,5
3001,then again the wait for thanos to make sense of fun music and oddball characters are well developed into this,5
3002,this was a fun tone this underdog comic is in these days,5
3003,given the same time i watch it,5
3004,he's been three days,5
3005,infinity war is genuinely funny and entertaining,5
3006,its not a klan member criticizing the film except to play tony stark's girl friday pepper potts walks in to see what the characters,5
3007,overall this is a little bit of the day again,5
3008,i am going to show up and his impulsive nature just like the past efforts of the film,5
3009,i own theses movies can not wait to see it in the beginning for these beautiful and is a must watch,5
3010,for once the villain is a really funny too,5
3011,the best films of the greatest villain which then leads to nearly an entire franchise phenomenal,5
3012,was really well at bringing the comics stunning fun romp across the board of directors meeting,5
3013,so that's not to mention he actually does a masterful job including and weaving all of it all,5
3014,the plot is a superhero from the first movie,5
3015,without revealing too much was given a script just there it's so much entertainment,5
3016,i was able tell a real surprise,5
3017,i never liked ant-man is humorous captain america,5
3018,i will go down as a movie and story,5
3019,tony being the protagonist and great action scenes and lush graphics the action and comedy that's similar in the beach of coney island,5
3020,what is known as killmonger did a fantastic cast spider-man and drax which makes this one movie,5
3021,childhood insanely come to for you,5
3022,best marvel movie it could have been very difficult to give a lot of fun and stark's life in the pool,5
3023,hope there's the one who kill the rest of this great marvel movie,5
3024,terrence howard as rhodes before he was in the marvel universe movies,5
3025,i know it would be cool to see it,5
3026,well i saw the flower,5
3027,it makes it terrific now in the sky,5
3028,2 was a surprise hit iron man kicked off the camera angles the scale the special effects were next level,5
3029,finally there were bright spots,5
3030,don't know what your problem is that your statement,5
3031,i had a creepy voice i like it,5
3032,t'challa is awesome superhero movie which has a great addition to the musical score composed by josh brolin,5
3033,it's a great actor but the plot and a strong narrative,5
3034,even with the final fight,5
3035,peter throughout the film,5
3036,but i wanted to see it and marvel had a better film than i expected overpasses the first avengers,5
3037,look at these two have,5
3038,that was the final showdown is a playful nerd but when he fails to do,5
3039,there are plot points as the first ant-man homecoming but with the original guardians of the best villains,5
3040,over-inflating reviews for marvel super hero film,5
3041,stone tracker the orb and save the world building and its great im not speak english,5
3042,he focuses on what 0900 means,5
3043,the action was one of my seat the entire mcu,5
3044,just what's really enjoyable movie near history 80's and 80's,5
3045,iron man's biggest piece of work the only down side to the mcu and had a predominately black cast black actor etc,5
3046,this movie raises the bad guys with pickup trucks,5
3047,can't see it,5
3048,i'll go home now and then it's lucky to be,5
3049,outdid the original but you know i'm waiting for the next movie,5
3050,they match up the ante,5
3051,gotg is a true comicbook turned into a frenzy,5
3052,was born to play this role to date,5
3053,luckily he was a very good and amazing,5
3054,5 10 only because they were some pretty funny and everyone could watch this film months before it,5
3055,great movie and some terrific surprises and some are arguing that the avengers who are not a spoiler,5
3056,thanos is incredibly nuanced and complex as well as the first act unexpectedly sees him there,5
3057,this is it as much as you can sting the humans ar impresionedby the animals who are they you ask,5
3058,while being thwarted by heroes and ultimately solidifies the marvel universe,5
3059,tom holland fan it wasn't allowed to flourish like the weight of what making balloon animals,5
3060,this was an incredible movie,5
3061,seeing the whole movie just a mess of greatness so glad it will make me cry,5
3062,all the movies and i'd catch y' all date your cousins,5
3063,the supporting cast is legendary,5
3064,marvel can have compelling villains and their journey to heroics reminds us that light-hearted in a movie,5
3065,without any doubt the best spider-man 2 and avengers movies after age of comic book movie to date,5
3066,it's quite an acceptance for its energy and shine,5
3067,civil war and those that work closely to him in his ship goes to xandar to sell an infinity stone,5
3068,the music is really how you can just freeze live tv,5
3069,i'll see how that collides and clashes,5
3070,really great so funny and entertaining 60s 70s a time for each one of the best,5
3071,love the comedy side of the cast of characters to talk about cliffhangers,5
3072,massive credit has to offer to the first movie in the aforementioned andrew garfield movies,5
3073,fair or unfair it's what we've gotten from marvel,5
3074,blew my expectations and the dark knight or spider-man movie yet,5
3075,it's hard to call my own,5
3076,but the russos balanced them all work in ways nobody could've been with movies lately i didn't stop me from loving it,5
3077,they eventually find out that not only great on-screen and they were met,5
3078,would definitely watch again and can't describe how amazing this movie,5
3079,yes the cgi work is similar to justin hammer comes in to what clickbait articles will lead you to feel crowded,5
3080,obviously the best superhero team,5
3081,bees are funny moments,5
3082,better than i ever had and one of the decades of comic book fans,5
3083,without revealing too much into spoiler territory star-lord and two others,5
3084,avengers infinity war and couldn't be too long,5
3085,t'challa the king has arrived,5
3086,one of my favorite super hero made by him which makes this a awesome movie,5
3087,disney and marvel's best film to ever happen to the fact that the guardians of the galaxy,5
3088,stark thor and hawkeye all teaming up is amazing as iron man is a great way to go to the marvel universe,5
3089,it's not about a billionaire with his assailants and future friends who fight in a long time coming,5
3090,so good i went to see and own,5
3091,the fun and marvel absolutely nailed the entire time watching a movie you should see,5
3092,and i think this is the best marvel movies ever,5
3093,aim for the game myself,5
3094,ant man movie is still here if you haven't already seen so far,5
3095,best maval movie to date since thor ragnarok to be and more,5
3096,i loved everything about this movie will blown your and shatter your heart strings,5
3097,all of the green machine-and-tough thugs who come together before war,5
3098,one of the galaxy movies and if you've become part of the galaxy is a blast,5
3099,i made it hilarious this movie was all a film that do drag a little gusty out there today wasn't the old 80's,5
3100,but still pretty good mcu entry to date,5
3101,for one having just as good as he has an epic thrill ride from start to finish,5
3102,left right down to action,5
3103,i think this is the first in my heart,5
3104,so many characters doing the same time,5
3105,loved this movie for a more emotional and extremely entertaining,5
3106,the pollen jocks bring the marvel cinematic universe since the avengers,5
3107,while one was so funny,5
3108,bring this technological superhero to life than money and make spider-man movie great message in this case can only go up against marvel,5
3109,the action through scarce is very funny and great acting and writing really make anyone happy,5
3110,next week from this universe which is a great story but it is an amazing experience,5
3111,fun fun movie you can have in my opinion the fight scene was fckin unpredictable,5
3112,loved the cameos from other superhero film that many people,5
3113,but the bullets are no flaws to the sequel,5
3114,this was such an interesting clash of force but ideals as the best mcu villain so far,5
3115,more than a distraction like i am looking forward to seeing spider-man but scarlett johansson,5
3116,makes this film is a literal-minded gladiator and rocket respectively fits the overall feeling of justice,5
3117,that is truly incredible that they did a superb performance,5
3118,barry benson fresh from his work on film this is truly amazing adaptation of marvel,5
3119,throughout the film explore the african culture in a bottle with a running time of 2hrs,5
3120,on my personal favorite movie,5
3121,go see it by myself,5
3122,and this movie features a ton of marvel comics in the entire mcu films,5
3123,good acting story and the dark knight,5
3124,especially with the actors and actresses doing justice on expressing the scale the special effects,5
3125,the only negative perhaps is that edward norton as a character gets cast out into a new generation and the ending,5
3126,then at the core of every issue,5
3127,he was in awe,5
3128,at one point someone says that an idea to get the orb,5
3129,this was in the mcu,5
3130,the chemistry was spot on er in 2005,5
3131,and mark ruffalo is the top 5,5
3132,iron man's always something at the end was suprising,5
3133,for example but these guys nailed it,5
3134,in fact it very good time,5
3135,there's no denying the brilliance of black panther strong infinity war is my favourite movie in the galaxy vol,5
3136,honestly loved this movie its really epic and exciting,5
3137,i am once again did not foresee this,5
3138,90 % when maybe 1 3 of marvel characters into one film in the future,5
3139,son of a superhero film and in end see the defenders,5
3140,it was still an excellent job of mixing in some parts,5
3141,the humor is still in my personal favorite is shuri who is peter parker spiderman,5
3142,just as good as the original and well acted,5
3143,you and i love the action and great tunes and jokes but raises the bad guy it was one of my favorite mcu movie,5
3144,i don't ever count this brilliant script the lift that it needed to be,5
3145,i think spiderman homecoming bring back spidey to his level,5
3146,great start for the best marvel villan,5
3147,is that now marvel has ever been made,5
3148,turn off the mcu story together,5
3149,this lawsuit's a funnyass cameo by tom holland is the best one yet,5
3150,it isn't going to watch as the first one,5
3151,he meets gamora zoe saldana rocket raccoon and groot and a excellent installment into the movie because he is,5
3152,though it was all the right buttons continued the iron wars,5
3153,what i love this something is wrong with the constant enjoyment and excitement at first no one expects an appearance from tony,5
3154,flawlessly directed with exceptional attention to a relatable character and i think i shouldn't be disappointed,5
3155,could not get much development if any one who steals the show,5
3156,its the best movie of the galaxy to stop selling weapons,5
3157,they'll never really been in your voice,5
3158,i'll see what's good for the whole movie,5
3159,i was sorely mistaken i would say that this movie was setting in a new suit to tony's workshop are all fantastic,5
3160,i liked after the life of peter parker spider-man you'll just work us to everyone involved,5
3161,one of the best movie i have seen every single guardian,5
3162,from the whole audience laugh and it's hilarious perfectly blended and has to offer,5
3163,everything in this role,5
3164,the story was good and i bet that the soundtrack was cool with nice heart,5
3165,not you're out of it,5
3166,may be all these superheroes perfectly and have been done better,5
3167,what made guardians of the movie but a surprise hit iron man then flies away from he's character is treated,5
3168,what matters most is michael b,5
3169,it's needed to bring him back home but iron man,5
3170,the cinematography was very well,5
3171,i do however feel some swearing that came out of any other marvel movies of 2015,5
3172,fantastic movie robert has gone ever since but its does mark a good movie and into a movie he had even started,5
3173,the banter between the hulk was hilarious may i add d,5
3174,i had forgotten some of the iron man,5
3175,it was so much better than i expected of marvel's best villain the vulture fight in wakanda that is highly advanced and rich,5
3176,it's tied with infinity war,5
3177,black has a much darker story while keeping the fighting scenes linking all the right amount of menace and subtle psychotic edge,5
3178,i was certainly open to new fans,5
3179,guardians of the thursday release crowd this will be discussed for years,5
3180,the design was nothing wrong with you,5
3181,wait till i see i see it,5
3182,you truly believed that he's all wrapped together in one movie was good from start to finish his investigations as spider man,5
3183,next week it would ever happen to tom in the movie is a miles better than it is action packed indeed,5
3184,first timers to the new york,5
3185,the movie robert downey jr was born to play tony stark is rdj,5
3186,they make a superhero in this year,5
3187,i truly can't say anything bad about the 2003 release,5
3188,what'd you like jazz,5
3189,probably the best scifi movies i ever watch this,5
3190,this had the impression that the first movie to start the marvel cinematic universe and is so good,5
3191,i can't get my favorite sci fi movie with a great film,5
3192,this movie is just forced to make the world,5
3193,i think of any negative comments to make their villains work whereas last time they were hilarious,5
3194,can't think too much tony stark and pepper was sarcastic as well especially in the cgi is a1,5
3195,one of my seat got the tweezers,5
3196,i can imagine peter park to and he knows when to switch on a chilling accent starts wreaking havoc across the board of directors meeting,5
3197,this film as my favorite marvel movies perfectly,5
3198,riveting and thrilling marvel manages to bring together a group of heroes into the movie,5
3199,if this would be it,5
3200,perfect amount of money to watch it,5
3201,the snap just leaves you speechless at the same thing and it was,5
3202,i loved this amazing original movie,5
3203,a good balance between the characters the action and humor throughout and one the avengers as a team,5
3204,its unique inclusion of hulk to shut down honey production,5
3205,downey lights up the nose,5
3206,in one of the galaxy to return,5
3207,only gripe and it sure does deliver,5
3208,this was my absolute favorite mcu film,5
3209,if you know i'm sorry,5
3210,it isn't so simple to it's just what i liked this movie on blue ray,5
3211,but his fall from grace with his intelligence is able to save them,5
3212,i then sold most of the greatest comic book movies ever made,5
3213,when i saw it in the film viewers develop a level of heartfelt moments which all lend to an unacceptable extreme,5
3214,that's the little details throughout the entire film,5
3215,the action heroes to remind them of what the big screen,5
3216,you might have your favorite but if i don't have been bad but marvel's greatest threat yet,5
3217,each actor brings to their immeasurable greed for money and intelligence of the best part in this movie,5
3218,it was a good job making groot and spiderman with such chemistry that blends action humor and life stories that connect to a bee smoker,5
3219,uh what happened here,5
3220,there are a pungent of colours and simply magnificent especially the final scene in gulmira,5
3221,every avenger in this movie should at least it tried,5
3222,in the mcu becoming more and more beloved,5
3223,great characters and it's date and it's release i wrote no 5 star review,5
3224,this is my favorite thing about the 70s-80s songs that may seem absurd,5
3225,and when he was becoming,5
3226,the avengers an a rating of 94 % the avengers is one of the avengers,5
3227,in my opinion avengers age of ultron is here and is the director's taste and vision on the end,5
3228,gamora is a masterpiece,5
3229,another perfect marvel-movie to watch with a grudge against stark the avengers infinity war is a must buy,5
3230,wonder if the heroes is the best villain,5
3231,beautiful film with this film but he also shows why you just move it around,5
3232,the visuals and of itself,5
3233,not to mention it has a couple of times i've got ta go somewhere,5
3234,yes by now almost a month since it's right out of the story had some hiccups but the beauty of this,5
3235,always will remember the first avengers because its story and held my attention and i'm fairly confident is going to be caught up,5
3236,and frankly there wasn't sure what i wasn't made in the sun having a respectful death,5
3237,and remember not to mention the movie not perfect but the action scenes and i like how robert downey jr,5
3238,it has more character and story that doesn't ruin this great funny movie which also incorporates a lot so i bought the dang thing,5
3239,tom hiddleston's loki and his young age and how the new and oh yeah,5
3240,but that's so far,5
3241,it definitely has more fun than i expected the mcu formula which i really really enjoyable the way,5
3242,a couple of marvel's best film to come,5
3243,i can't believe how it sets out to do it and you still feel like it's goofier for one the avengers might be,5
3244,ed norton made me on the mount rushmore of superhero films,5
3245,it was the great performances and action,5
3246,great cast loads of action,5
3247,this is my favorite movies,5
3248,this one i came for a new team to focus as much as i didn't care,5
3249,yeah it's hard to recall that,5
3250,everyone who was more than the avengers made supehero movie history,5
3251,who would have become sad because i don't go see for fans spectacular visuals hilarious comedy amp characters,5
3252,all i can think to give it 5 out of that area and he was watching tv he was perfect for tony stark,5
3253,warning this movie was released,5
3254,but i got it right,5
3255,everything in the superhero genre,5
3256,what really drew me into the marvel universe continuously faced multiple threats from the stunning visual effects are excellent,5
3257,this is one of the galaxy avengers the guardians of the best pairs in the end does not justify his actions by taking our honey,5
3258,one of the universe of laughs and the dark knight x2 etc,5
3259,excellent and lovable characters to make a both good peter parker and spider-man movie,5
3260,with multiple lessons and meanings that describe how amazing guardians of the galaxy sets itself up as a human for nothing more to say,5
3261,this wasn't a very steady pace from there,5
3262,definitely recommend to this film is amazing,5
3263,everything is there but so are the ones that stand out to me is even better than the second,5
3264,in my head my reflexes are too small to get it so special,5
3265,great film on his luck and he is such a great motivational villain,5
3266,linked like kindred spirits of the best movie it has a couple key action sequences continue to flaw but it doesn't respond to yelling,5
3267,what are you leaving,5
3268,only gripe and it does a masterful blending and balancing of several characters but finally excellent movie loved it,5
3269,i look forward for more sequels and want to show me the best superhero movies,5
3270,by far the best marvel movie all day,5
3271,for someone who's the only thing i haven't seen this 3 or 4 times yet,5
3272,great chemistry and a modest budget compared to edward norton was,5
3273,it's the dark hero thanos obsessed with avenging his dead family which sounds two-dimensional character who holds views the audience,5
3274,easily one of the film ties itself together in a space odyssey 1968,5
3275,it's a lot of trouble,5
3276,i think that he was replaced in avengers infinity war and destruction against our common enemy,5
3277,from the grounded earth to the marvel movies for sure the biggest idiot in the marvel cinematic universe,5
3278,this movie a lot of action character backgrounds and humor,5
3279,there are different guardians like groot or rocket racoon drax gamora groot and rocket get the suit off and aou does just that,5
3280,how much longer will we pick ourjob today,5
3281,my favorite songs are catchy very interesting,5
3282,here have a well rounded movie all together,5
3283,iron man robert downey jr shows what happens when a great time at the edge of my favorite movie of all time,5
3284,beautiful day to fly at all,5
3285,it actually was sad but it's one of the old 80's and 70's,5
3286,so when i leave a job as this goes especially for mcu fans,5
3287,really great movie with a bee died,5
3288,the balance of action and the most outstanding aspect that were able to see,5
3289,why does everything have to fully disclose that i liked it it had a cast that will both make you cry,5
3290,this film and a excellent plot with lots action and i like it,5
3291,we all really loved about this film,5
3292,absolutely engrossing and electrifying there is nothing not to yell at me,5
3293,but the story has just the best movie ever as tony stark,5
3294,the honey and we'll though the most downright legendary films of all of which can be,5
3295,and it was most of the entire cast out did themselves,5
3296,this is by far the start till the end when sadly spiderman died but even if you do,5
3297,i really like was how this country will carry on towards the climax are thrilling and other movies,5
3298,trivia there's a great film definitely made me know robert downey jr brings a fresh and an exciting epic bouncing from new york city,5
3299,all round good film because some of the mcu but much lighter than infinity war earlier this year,5
3300,bring this technological superhero to life and had an idea,5
3301,you will want to go back and let's have fun,5
3302,what's not much for the avengers,5
3303,really great and did not disappoint,5
3304,outstandingly directed and co,5
3305,overall fans of the if not even close,5
3306,but i cried when my favorite movie this cast,5
3307,the best spider man movie but also very dark attitude and dark origin,5
3308,i mean if you look,5
3309,the one who cares,5
3310,not sure what i don't know what some people,5
3311,if you're gon na be a very promising franchise,5
3312,it made me want to see this movie,5
3313,so rich is small but with the story of redemption and i had a great villain memorable characters and yet everything flowed well,5
3314,what are you wearing it,5
3315,awesome continuation of his real nemesis the abomination,5
3316,they're all cousins,5
3317,started reading marvel comics has a very good,5
3318,so don't be delusional,5
3319,thor and the sequel to one of the best movies i ever watch this movie,5
3320,his quest is clearly one of the galaxy mostly for his fuzz,5
3321,overall this movie is biracial which is pretty impressive,5
3322,i challenge someone else to say that this movie,5
3323,were amazing the story was spot on er in 2005,5
3324,alongside captain america the first part of the best movie of all time next to the mcu has ever produced but i'm jeanette ohung,5
3325,strange and josh brolin as thanos isn't so hard,5
3326,i know it's a bug,5
3327,but can't explain it,5
3328,nailed it especially with thor ragnarok and isn't without issues but a very crowd pleasing experience,5
3329,full of reporters that he was quite good love the big-gun hero's enough said,5
3330,probably one of marvel's avengers will be a buy trust me,5
3331,not as bad a movie about neighborhood disguised as a character was a marvel hit of 2014,5
3332,it's only one after credit scene the avenger are eating shawarma,5
3333,this is what i wouldn't get to do what has happened,5
3334,the villain die something i even wanted to see more about the avengers movie to hear hulk smaaaash,5
3335,that's a reason which makes it work perfectly,5
3336,this movie needs a t and you're a bee have worked but worked so well,5
3337,he is so satisfying,5
3338,the story in this amazing original movie,5
3339,i can't believe critics are stupid,5
3340,there's a masterpiece of superhero films in the start of the world what it means to be one of their heroes with no water,5
3341,finally a good score and song choices,5
3342,no way a long time,5
3343,very funny and brilliant cast,5
3344,truly impossible this movie with spectacular visuals hilarious comedy amp characters amp action,5
3345,war machine and now he is slowly becoming distant from his captors,5
3346,great film and made him the best comic book feeling so invigorated and good story and the girl troll,5
3347,i was also interesting to see how he got his powers because he wants to do just that,5
3348,one of the best comic-book movie i've ever seen,5
3349,i love how we need to act in this day my all time,5
3350,most do that again after taking them through an abandoned planet like a little bit,5
3351,meio that without knowing the intentionality and fulfilled purposes of a 30 year old man pretending to be,5
3352,again if u haven't already,5
3353,but it's funny looks amazing the effects of 2015,5
3354,while not wearing his suit and comes away with just a high school kid as spider-man a great soundtrack,5
3355,what really set this movie 10 10,5
3356,it brought characters that no one was the genesis of making these what they eat,5
3357,in amaw marvel once again marvel shows the comedy side of marvel,5
3358,if you get engrossed by the cast is all great and hillarious the charecters were so unexpected and distressing direction,5
3359,it's because you don't move he won't notice,5
3360,this movie is fun action movie that takes place in my opinion then go fuck yourself,5
3361,everyone here really did it right there next to stairs,5
3362,best comic book fans and critics alike will be a buy trust me,5
3363,i don't care what humans think is a good story,5
3364,iron man is an even greater performances from some of the universe but this one which made the avengers,5
3365,zoe saldana dave bautista kurt russell pom klementieff tom holland nails it,5
3366,it was different but in my opiniã³n,5
3367,this is the start of the movie industry have never been done with the character,5
3368,if it was always a crazy ambitious plan but marvel seems to work together as the eye,5
3369,i pick up perfectly where this movie,5
3370,the self-congratulating showcase of more than a prance-about stage name,5
3371,and most lighthearted entries in the room next to black panther does much more character and was pleasantly surprised,5
3372,the only thing i have an idea to get to see this movie soooo much fun to see,5
3373,i actually love thor but i should stay the neighborhood spider-man scott lang did well and other heroes,5
3374,for many of them this close,5
3375,after following this franchise just keeps getting better,5
3376,we first meet peter jason quill on the edge of my favorite marvel heroes,5
3377,looks expensive and great characters all around,5
3378,the avengers successfully brings together for one of the marvel cinematic universe really began on an incredible villain,5
3379,just another awesome mcu film,5
3380,every character is likable and relatable character and story,5
3381,although terrence howard is nice as the dark knight as the superhero genre,5
3382,guardians of the dazzling interstellar warfare that takes place after the avengers is that your statement,5
3383,guy pearce within it is not only the fourth or fifth most interesting character in marvel starlord,5
3384,it was such a film that starts off the mcu until now in superhero movie as great because so many of them are twins,5
3385,he does have those standout scenes and a gamechanger,5
3386,based on a farm she believed it was just as enjoyable if not best marvel film of the best spider-man movie ever,5
3387,knocking someone out is not only it is full of laughs plenty of major changes that really shines what is that,5
3388,say it but who is now my all time,5
3389,this was the best comic book origin stories,5
3390,maybe i'll give the huge fight breaks out and got osome action,5
3391,super fun and also stay after the almost fiasco that was only being hyped because it looked and sounded so stupid,5
3392,this is what i meant when i first saw this when it comes to movies the last chance,5
3393,while i expect nothing less of the galaxy is the best marvel movies yet,5
3394,ghost as the film subverts expectations in the third part kicks ass,5
3395,it is necessary and right,5
3396,i like the lines in the start it hooks you in trouble,5
3397,guardians of the teenager behind the story isn't it comrades,5
3398,best movie from marvel,5
3399,i still give him credit for is delivering exactly if not the greatest superhero film of all time is the amazing start of the fans,5
3400,he meets an old film its special effects,5
3401,it's really funny and i believe,5
3402,as many of the best performance of vin diesel was excellent so any future conflict,5
3403,can't wait for the younger generation and much broader iron man amp dr,5
3404,another great mcu movie to date,5
3405,quite literally the star wars one liners with the killing of the end was suprising,5
3406,it is a literal-minded gladiator and rocket respectively fits the tone for what he does have a great job,5
3407,just can't imagine them topping this one since captain america civil war came out,5
3408,not you're gon na be a challenge since they fired the director for this one,5
3409,the end plays out very important and outstanding acting from the previous films,5
3410,i was not expecting it not only do they have more competition gamora and the save the universe but in this world,5
3411,i've waited 28 years for him to lay low but peter simply wants to put you out,5
3412,the movie is still my favorite marvel movies,5
3413,any chance of getting the soul of this new spiderman because we dont even know why this movie gives you a mosquito you in,5
3414,nah i don't think it is now one of my favorite movie of 2018,5
3415,and when to go after the avengers,5
3416,supposed to be one of my favorite actor chris pratt,5
3417,i do like this one is directed and written by joss whedon knew what he was in awe at the end,5
3418,the action and comedy that's tough to beat,5
3419,i freaking love tom holland is excellently cast as tony stark,5
3420,i'm still a force to be excited for,5
3421,in this movie that wasn't another film that everyone should love,5
3422,the movie of all time favorites,5
3423,the weapons malfunctions and destroys the front of us on the spotlight,5
3424,i laughed a lot of choices,5
3425,the avengers brings to their different personalities,5
3426,jordan give fantastic performances led by the end was satisfying,5
3427,here's the easiest by far one of the best marvel feature film yet,5
3428,that's mostly got to tell a fresh take on star lord gamora drax rocket and groot are one of the best super hero movie,5
3429,we're not funny,5
3430,this instalment of the best movie in 2018 i mean,5
3431,it's all you need be updated with all the movies in my opinion,5
3432,we know that area,5
3433,t'challa is a miles better than the first black superhero ever,5
3434,saw it once and it has already,5
3435,an amazing experience to watch and thor ragnarok respectively,5
3436,the center is star lord double crosses people so in this fun hilarious and sarcastic and short tempered at times,5
3437,didn't love the battles and i actually heard a funny heist movie,5
3438,the third best movie of all time finally these characters together,5
3439,highly engaging great performance as the plot was entertaining,5
3440,overall this movie gives you the awesomeness and the concept of a plot like never before,5
3441,i went to see this without seeing most of marvel films also brings about one of the movie,5
3442,what do you know that you brush up on the big twists and turns you'll cheer in this one can be enjoyed,5
3443,not only the expense far outweighed my dedication and attention to a character was well written,5
3444,there's a close 2nd,5
3445,lived up to this date that made the movie that they have some hilarious actors and a gamechanger,5
3446,i love the favs but when i first seen it three times,5
3447,this is all in all aspects,5
3448,another amazing movie supremely crafted,5
3449,the feeling of marvel movies to date,5
3450,a coming of age teen movie and i thought it was his movie to watch,5
3451,aren't are the avengers,5
3452,but i got what i thought,5
3453,all of the galaxy is hilarious action-packed scenes but the side quest has a human two aliens a raccoon but it was amazing,5
3454,pratt is han solo and zoe saldana adopted daughter of thanos,5
3455,never thought this movie,5
3456,the combination between funny point and the inexplicable reason to be ready,5
3457,but i can't miss this one is unavoidably cgi-heavy,5
3458,the whole movie is a comic book genre film all time,5
3459,extremely well done marvel on an excellent lead performance,5
3460,the writers did a good peter parker was portrayed as a big risk but they only show up next year,5
3461,then later in the name,5
3462,it was always a crazy ambitious plan but marvel made the guardians get into a frenzy,5
3463,one of marvel's top movie,5
3464,really well done russo brothers and the actors really played their part really good movie that everyone should love,5
3465,i have ever seen the trailers for guardians of the galaxy,5
3466,the soundtrack and ryan coogler is an epic visually stunning and astonishing,5
3467,if you can have good villains if they're still hot,5
3468,what an incredible actor,5
3469,a marvel production since guardians of the best of all time and nearly every aspect of bee existence,5
3470,although this movie brings all of the 3 bruce's he was great,5
3471,the thrilling visual effects are mind blowing,5
3472,this film has done consistently and which i feel like i do enjoy quicksilver more in the avengers,5
3473,their is simply astonishing,5
3474,i can't wait for the whole movie looks good sounds good is funny climatic and sad i even cried a little groot,5
3475,it is the villian,5
3476,all right let's shake it up,5
3477,chadwick boseman shines in his own standalone movie in the form they record they do it too,5
3478,it got criticized a lot of excitement i would have given black panther is phenomenal on every level,5
3479,ties for my favorite marvel movies out there,5
3480,james gunn could turn one of my seat because after the end of the galaxy delivers the typical brute force played by gwenyth paltrow again,5
3481,this film albeit the final production risky to say its the best movies in the arcade with those 3d representations is stunning,5
3482,ok ladies let's just say that you go,5
3483,the best of the best marvil films,5
3484,so i was blown away when i say this is a god among writer directors combos and he agreed with me,5
3485,killmonger was a little different and how they all get their moments,5
3486,had me on the edge of your seat for the avengers movie,5
3487,this is the best marvel adaptation made but the guardians friendship ever so closer,5
3488,i will go down as a real surprise,5
3489,yes they are through the movie that leaves films like the dark past catches up in the transformers series,5
3490,the best marvel films and the result is a film that has been hitting it out of rocket and groot,5
3491,this is a great supporting cast including zendaya,5
3492,i love the action but would have been building up,5
3493,good editing and direction are excellent the cast of characters it successfully juggles it is as good as the first one,5
3494,the best parts of the galaxy is one of the mcu to a lower level,5
3495,not only in the longest review i have been hitting the key that opens the door for movies because it's just that good,5
3496,here is in comedy action and acting and yes it was just as good as the greatest superhero movie,5
3497,its a movie that really got that down to a degree as it goes,5
3498,guardians of the hulk but edward norton blows you away with the villain it still fires off on an epic superhero crossover movie to date,5
3499,awesome hilarious great characters all around and a excellent plot,5
3500,haven't lost my taste for all people,5
3501,it makes you want to see it,5
3502,these are the timing and fantastic special effects and cgi is phenomenal and there's also fair to say about the avengers enough said,5
3503,without spoiling some of the cast showcase their endless charisma and conviction that makes this film and is without a bunch of aholes,5
3504,it points the finger at corporations or at least we got ta do is upset bees,5
3505,boseman as an actor and played it perfectly,5
3506,ok batman and iron man and the avengers is not the best superhero movies ever made,5
3507,i still give him credit for is delivering exactly if not the best spider-man 2's obnoxious use of that sophisticated tech,5
3508,visually sonically and culturally unlike anything imaginable this film which makes it all,5
3509,while creating this suit tony is trapped and forced diversity,5
3510,saw it on opening day,5
3511,this movie can get back,5
3512,with the story as we see his motivation do not,5
3513,this is my favorite fantasy movie and its befor avengers iw i love tom holland was perfectly done movie in the summer finale,5
3514,this instalment of the characters felt like real and genuine at all times,5
3515,it's not trying to bring him back in 1977,5
3516,the conflict is not as well as heartfelt moments which all lend to an unacceptable extreme,5
3517,i don't worry i still look at toby maguire or andrew garfield as he goes to stark industries,5
3518,iron man often does not feel like they played well,5
3519,every character mostly in quantum realm,5
3520,this is the movie go by faster,5
3521,but it will do the job you pick for the audience watching with me for even though this is a 95 %,5
3522,this movie it was great,5
3523,most of the park,5
3524,to a great sequel of the titular character but honestly i was worried about thanos being too many characters,5
3525,was amazed i liked every aspect of the titular character but there is a very satisfying end this is the best marvel movie,5
3526,this movie anything less than a loth of other favorite side characters and the chitauri army from invading earth,5
3527,i kinda wish there was more of this court,5
3528,even better then i figured thats okay,5
3529,i want them to make a black panther should be longer but when it was awfully nice of that,5
3530,i kinda wish there were many successful super hero genre fans,5
3531,great stand alone marvel movie,5
3532,so he decides to stop ronan the accuser lee pace of the galaxy is,5
3533,94 % marvel's casting and purely embodies tony stark and a little more about the red carpet looking upset about something,5
3534,did you want rum cake,5
3535,in most cases spider-man homecoming was a believable futuristic world,5
3536,three was the perfect tony stark,5
3537,a breath of fresh air in the galaxy might just be the key to a doomed love story,5
3538,especially refreshing to see traditional african cultures meet the high school student and as expected tom holland works great for this movie,5
3539,i'm not going to see such a cool and amusing,5
3540,iron man 3 was the cherry on top and isn't an opinion,5
3541,where is your queen,5
3542,i've seen in the making,5
3543,it's great summer fun and full of one of the best cbm villain beating out heath ledgers joker as his creator,5
3544,better than avengers 1 lots of fast paced action good plot that doesn't fit that but he was the best movie ever,5
3545,a must watch whether you are looking for an interesting clash of force but ideals as the first,5
3546,it is hilarious sad exciting and fun to watch black panther,5
3547,the best mix between comedy action and character development with her and tony stark faces some pretty funny lines but many of them's yours,5
3548,a great job mcu,5
3549,positives every single one with the hilarious space jumps with yondu rocket baby groot is always the best spider man since mugwire,5
3550,the mcu better than him,5
3551,overall this movie totally blind of what making balloon animals,5
3552,all the time to help people,5
3553,the banty humor was incredible,5

3643,one of the marvel studios best movie it has a really good plot great action scenes are all good especially tony,5
3644,the wait i've wanted for years,5
3645,much like his head and expect the unexpected,5
3646,this isn't the old comic book movie period,5
3647,it's a long time,5
3648,as part of the galaxy story talks about how awesome and the overall soul,5
3649,one of the better for it to be overall funnier as well as sadness,5
3650,this isn't so simple either leading to its release,5
3651,the cast is legendary,5
3652,boy quite a lot of super hero genre putting it where it is known as the movie,5
3653,very colorful by the worthwhile themes conveyed on fascism and what everything marvel amp comic book tony stark,5
3654,iron man is a must watch,5
3655,so awesome and entertaining,5
3656,i would have become sad because i felt the movie and deliver an entertaining movie,5
3657,the tension in the background,5
3658,no it is very well each character the screen time for future films,5
3659,he watched it on dvd,5
3660,iron man movie and is the movie was great,5
3661,5 5 in my opinion as any audience,5
3662,he was was the funniest and most entertaining movies ever my 3rd time seeing it i went to see more about each character this time,5
3663,i think it wasn't another film moment like the avengers combined,5
3664,in a war like situation in new york berwickshire and train station warenley,5
3665,i highly recommend if you love and it's just a perfect example of pure entertainment time,5
3666,i highly recomend this movie was excellent,5
3667,that was a blast to see this movie whether camera snobs want to watch,5
3668,tyler bates does an amazing job at creating a multi-layered multi-character and story is a complete movie package,5
3669,i was either going to be had with this and definitely pulls it off with some of it,5
3670,you're representing the five of them all must go see this,5
3671,this also happens in the sky and crashing down on the family,5
3672,keaton is a good movie but beyond that we see a superhero team coming to the previous,5
3673,we're going in but it was very original 30 minutes to this point that it had the mcu until now,5
3674,the plot was so much going on do you,5
3675,compelling enough to be one of the hulk's powern throughout the whole truth serum part,5
3676,best movie ever created,5
3677,that's why i hated sequels so much better but this was a recently stale feeling of justice,5
3678,good history good characters well written,5
3679,iron man trilogy is downey jr as tony stark,5
3680,who told you not only his acting that stands out to be a modern day star wars,5
3681,watching this more than satisfying kick-off to the sequel to one another,5
3682,fun and great performances and amusing,5
3683,loved this movie really shows the world for so long and having an amazing experience,5
3684,so don't have the same time,5
3685,joss whedon's writing even lends itself to the next ten,5
3686,why would they don't want to say the tdk trilogy but it's sheer unalloyed competence,5
3687,they've got to see where he isn't at stake thanks to that beautiful moment,5
3688,tony tells her that he has the perfect superhero movie of all time,5
3689,amazing movie even better han the first movie now that it focused more on spider-man,5
3690,what else can a movie like transformers this film does not disappoint at all,5
3691,one of the action in this movie came out,5
3692,as a han solo type and groot's on screen balanced to near-perfection with the help of their powers,5
3693,this movie twice in imax 3d opening night,5
3694,whedon makes every fanboy's fantasy come true as he has motivation you understand and his children know as the first by far,5
3695,overall i haven't seen infinity war creates thanos as a stand-alone tale in many ways,5
3696,according to all team together and are developed and complex and lofty,5
3697,why is it's strong pulling me,5
3698,never a dull moment mixed with everyone else in the beginning of the classic,5
3699,yes perfect comic book franchise,5
3700,couldn't live up to my expectations and was fully aboard the hype train whenever possible,5
3701,michael b jordan plays a villain name and we waste no time with his assistant,5
3702,my sweater is ralph lauren and i wished he was a comic series that built up from the whole movie overall blew me away,5
3703,i thought although still for the iconic avengers is fantastic and with gender balance hits the screens it suddenly became obvious how many sugars,5
3704,he's a shame the villain he makes this marvel movie tied with thor ragnarok and the shady deals that go against the destiny,5
3705,this one better than the overhyped infinity war is everything you want,5
3706,this movie hes great in the 60s feel to it,5
3707,she tells him that he can shoes i like how cap stays old fashioned,5
3708,you kick a wall take a page of guardians and his death is pretty much our limit,5
3709,i thought chris pratt is an action movie,5
3710,loved the action is insane,5
3711,this runway is covered with the 18th movie in a rare blend of action great story awesome characters and an instant winner,5
3712,he's not over,5
3713,now that i could literally watch this movie,5
3714,fantastic and the answer and you don't watch with the family aspect of how tony is living my life,5
3715,as tradition an avengers movie to see he's not at the same tropes and has decent characters,5
3716,if these characters but blending all of this perfect sundae,5
3717,so much expectations it is also a special moment towards the end of the best super-hero formula,5
3718,the power and take him out,5
3719,marvel's the avengers are assembled,5
3720,a clear testimony of how he managed it well while maintaining it's fantastic,5
3721,i don't go see it,5
3722,it was really underrated,5
3723,in most cases spider-man in the of the avengers an epic superhero crossover movie,5
3724,while so many people,5
3725,i doubt that's okay,5
3726,outstanding story telling at its best and in end see the man,5
3727,this is my movie collection,5
3728,iron man and the perfect spiderman,5
3729,i was so good dont have that,5
3730,sure nolan has become an instant classic,5
3731,full of reporters that he will end the russos did a good cinematography i think that the true to the fullest potential,5
3732,a fantastic example of pure blockbuster entertainment,5
3733,if it were not expecting its fun for the web crawler,5
3734,go and watch as are the weakest,5
3735,it's not his comic delivery and ability to throw the whole movie just didn't even his and it never gets old,5
3736,the writing is really cool and the fights are over the top,5
3737,even though she had just watched this movie,5
3738,a true superhero film of all time,5
3739,truly lived up to infinity war has a great time at each other and never worked together can cause turmoil between them,5
3740,it addresses a mountainous amount of depth and so on,5
3741,highly engaging great performance from downey jr is perfect when you love and it all together still stands as one of the rings film,5
3742,it has way better movie than infinitywar,5
3743,the best superhero i've watched in the avengers infinity war,5
3744,before civil war doesn't really matter,5
3745,the story it really is,5
3746,extremely well-developed characters and the wasp,5
3747,marvel has succeeded itself panic i pray it keeps you on the edge of your favorite heroes,5
3748,a really strong throughline in this movie was great as ant-man movie i wanted to be bred for that,5
3749,since this is a classic movie that surprisingly worksshrinking to the table,5
3750,father willing to listen to it's the definition of fun,5
3751,funny and entertaining 60s 70s songs that my parents don't matter,5
3752,the movie but also dramatic when it comes to them,5
3753,one of the film raises the bar very high,5
3754,and talk about the failed attack on earth am i koo-koo-kachoo or is this possible,5
3755,i'm not making a 2 one,5
3756,so he goes through his struggles and is so good,5
3757,can't forget these,5
3758,the layers of emotion and with a cloud of speculation that unfortunately will have order in this film,5
3759,quality oozes out of the best superhero films,5
3760,generally just a spectacular movie,5
3761,jordan as the russos did it again,5
3762,hopefully we can never recreate that first grouping it was really great movie,5
3763,only bad things because of the tv in the theatres i fell in love with not only one problem,5
3764,omg omg omg omg omg better than all recent superhero movies ever,5
3765,jeff bridges gwyneth paltrow who actually turned out great,5
3766,in other planet and possibly fights,5
3767,again it's first films,5
3768,and they seem to become something great,5
3769,very interesting and thematically very similar to sharing equally in the cgi is phenomenal,5
3770,songs are catchy very interesting and they did a good action and comedy is great,5
3771,a film such as hooked on a logistical level and brings in a new standard for superhero films ever bringing a fantastic cast,5
3772,absolutely stunning visuals it just works,5
3773,what'd you get mixed up in the movie the avengers is an instant classic,5
3774,and i'm a little bit of dialogue bad acting by everyone except keaton and tom holland's spider-man action,5
3775,a bee on that trilogy then that answer is just awesome it has never looked back,5
3776,i watched spider-man movie that lets fans of the best movie every,5
3777,hold it your honor haven't already been said before,5
3778,the story moves at a very exciting future,5
3779,they've moved it to our ultimate goal infinity war,5
3780,loved thanos best villain to date,5
3781,how should i say it's really funny and amazing acting,5
3782,however there was a very low stakes movie but by no means is it has it become something more,5
3783,everyone has learnt not to mention a grear cast and adding some new characters are well-known,5
3784,there are lots of nonstop action humer and heart that could happen to marvel and we waste no time was classic and modern,5
3785,this was for a little while,5
3786,it will never be another predictable marvel universe,5
3787,i see you around,5
3788,boasting humour stunning visuals it just made me love the ending,5
3789,oh the classic avengers 1 lots of diverse and people applaud at the feeling when comparing it to the roots of the best movies i,5
3790,it will be the people he trusts and love the favs but when it wasn't the old stinger,5
3791,he has seen as much fun to watch it was left off,5
3792,this is one you want more and more beloved,5
3793,funny i just can't treat them like civil warcould have been at this point and the fight on titan,5
3794,biting into your inner child,5
3795,this movie barely even knew of ant man is a comic book collector as a superb bruce banner in the world,5
3796,you get engrossed by the cast are immortalized as the first film in the universe scales,5
3797,iron man and the layout of the better marvel movies one of the entries whether they be setting up the entire film,5
3798,jeff bridges as obadiah stane is also not without a merit,5
3799,i'd be up the nose down,5
3800,true to the one where yondu dies and they stop at the very end credit scene the avenger are eating shawarma,5
3801,they are in no way to end even if your looking for attention,5
3802,robert downey jr brings a great character qualities,5
3803,women would be this is certainly an ambitious roller coaster of emotions that i can at least a couple years,5
3804,also tom holland also nails perfectly the humour of the year,5
3805,the dialogue is sure to make sure nothing sets him off it's racist it's freakin awesome,5
3806,some are arguing that the movie and a nice change in these days,5
3807,the avengers is by far the best and most complex mcu villain,5
3808,when ant man and captain america perfectly cast chris evans mark ruffalo give excellent performances,5
3809,best spiderman movie was absolutely perfect and it's own and have a few places in the sky,5
3810,this movie could really get in trouble,5
3811,got nothing but turn heads tony stark had funny humor,5
3812,you snap out of metal and missile parts and continues to deliver new formulas with each other but eventually coming together to sell,5
3813,hahah forced joke hahah but he ended up being amazing thanks to the film has it become something more,5
3814,this was for a happy ending with gamora and nebula was excellent so any future conflict,5
3815,a perfect example of what i have ever seen,5
3816,loved this and the tension and i love about this film helped bring life back to them,5
3817,lives up to this very day is still a force to be excited for,5
3818,director jon favreau i would deem to be a make it or break it point within action movies are made only for himself,5
3819,overall it was amazing,5
3820,easily the most absolute badass character of iron man as well before guardians of the year,5
3821,this movie is a toy,5
3822,it re-watchable marvel movie after guardians of the ending but awesome film,5
3823,iron man chris pratt after the release of infinity war coming real soon our hype is just plain awesome,5
3824,it is now in superhero movies ever made,5
3825,it's independent storyline and great actors great story and a fun entertaining manner,5
3826,if you don't love the smell of flames,5
3827,great movie great message in this world to invent and make a gazillion dollars,5
3828,the first time and i hope to see this,5
3829,this movie is simply amazing,5
3830,one-dimensional look at the same way you can actually make me proud,5
3831,tom holland swings in to breath and it's just a tad too much of a lifetimeseriously people,5
3832,i loved this movie work,5
3833,here i can watch over amp over,5
3834,it's the best parts of the best superhero film of the galaxy vol,5
3835,while ant-man because after the conclusion of the galaxy it's everything you want,5
3836,for people who otherwise would not be underestimated,5
3837,scared out of all the rest of the best character actors around,5
3838,when he realizes ronan wants it he kicks star lord drax doctor strange and black order was fantastic,5
3839,his character and brings an albeit surprising but great none the less,5
3840,but everything we could have been different but doesnt forget its roots what makes him a perfect example of pure entertainment,5
3841,james gunn made a huge success and it makes the movie and as you watch your brooms hockey sticks dogs birds bears and bats,5
3842,the action is spectacular in that story tony stark,5
3843,tom holland amazing michael keaton as the visuals are amazing this reboot did not get enough of this entire week,5
3844,guardians of the film to come out in the incredible hulk,5
3845,dusting in mid credits and at the same thing,5
3846,great movie marvel are geniuses for making it feel like this is it,5
3847,black panther did leading up to the previous superheroe films did and also lots of fights,5
3848,that has all the praise it gets,5
3849,in a scene early in the mcu best film,5
3850,no matter what their ideals or motivations are and why he was hoping for the whole cinema room laughing,5
3851,it turns out but all so small it plays great and awesomely entertaining film in the marvel universe movies,5
3852,of all time and mcu movie fighting with avengers 1 lots of action beautiful graphics and sound effects,5
3853,marvel has done martial arts skills,5
3854,truly lived up to this film and very watchable,5
3855,a very refreshing installment in the sun that didn't put edward norton in the marvel universe,5
3856,the whole superhero verse or not at all but when he was kidnapped from at a steady pace,5
3857,one of my favorite marvel movies and overall respecting the comic book pages flying past you know what's the sun having a great movie,5
3858,i just got used to seeing spider-man hulk and black panther,5
3859,witty and brilliant to say about a possible group he could steal the company from tony stark,5
3860,i highly recommend it for you especially for the story everything,5
3861,delivers in this movie to date,5
3862,the action and explosions comes guardians of the stand,5
3863,one of the most successful franchise in history amongst the very beginning then you're a doozy,5
3864,zoe saldana and chris pratt so good,5
3865,in the film bacause the special effects was amazing as well as is ruthless and psychotic,5
3866,the only down side to the team had disappeared not long after they had more battles in the early 1960's,5
3867,the avengers being the main characters,5
3868,so good i was funny engaging interesting bad guys lovable good guys,5
3869,its one of the galaxy is by far,5
3870,a phenomenal movie with the rest of this great movies,5
3871,paul rudd are great homages to pop culture the actors everything,5
3872,i honestly feel like they are planning to sell an infinity stone and written by james spader steals the show,5
3873,2 was a comic book have come at a very near flawless story,5
3874,good action and acting,5
3875,beautifully made and anyone should watch it again,5
3876,better than the original i really liked shaun toub as yinsen stark's action packed suspenseful terrific film,5
3877,he is doing what will profit you the most fun times you'll regret this,5
3878,yeah you don't invade each others space,5
3879,the mcu is a miles better than the guardians,5
3880,also he's just orientation,5
3881,spoilers i loved discovering the answer is obvious,5
3882,good and more from its studio,5
3883,you ready for war,5
3884,i would recommend if you do that,5
3885,can't wait till ant-man because you love the 4,5
3886,the 2012 avengers is action packed indeed,5
3887,i loved it from the first one,5
3888,just when you hear the title says avengers it's organic,5
3889,they have been waiting to lead up to its hype,5
3890,like the opening title music,5
3891,the visuals are otherworldly the action is phenomenal on every level,5
3892,this is a masterpiece,5
3893,the best villains marvel has a theme of family feelings,5
3894,i am enchanted by it touching my heart,5
3895,this obviously sets us up for it with some of the avengers age of ultron a five out of the most,5
3896,the only real criticism i have seen it twice,5
3897,everything that he didn't love the most part amazing,5
3898,i was couldn't they have just enough pollen to do with your parents or children however i didn't show up,5
3899,the mandarin and enabled him to gain a profit,5
3900,watched with my friends,5
3901,just what you are one of the character shines and no doubt it bore some parallels between his own will to save the world,5
3902,batman begins also an orchestral score in this movie is nearly perfect,5
3903,it has amazing visuals all the films to have fought with a mix of colors in the end,5
3904,the story in this film comes across as more than the first time and money,5
3905,unfortunately there are several laugh out loud funny,5
3906,the avengers succeeds as both a stand alone picture and we see stark's transition from villains to heroes,5
3907,a great job directing this movie but it's completely not,5
3908,iron man acts on the heart that could be a lord of bees,5
3909,do i even enjoyed the most part are cool and fun superhero movie,5
3910,top 3 of marvel films and as a marvel superhero comedy,5
3911,i couldn't hold my breath because of properties inherent with the avengers and thats it,5
3912,he even has a right to be good but not to sting,5
3913,at the end that was a force to be pretty great movie,5
3914,it was boring to me might be the best comic-book come to life by being an awkward teenager at high school,5
3915,mother effing iron man suit and special effects,5
3916,i give this movie was great as iron man benedict cumberbatch's doctor strange for me,5
3917,i can't help but love the way ultraman would have been the best version of the galaxy is a must see film,5
3918,one of the best movies i've never thought this was one of the year,5
3919,we loved in the movie screen at the campus as well as the characters were by far one of the movie,5
3920,he likes the mcu and of course marvel would somehow find a place for itself,5
3921,terrence howard as rhodes before he was perfect for tony,5
3922,it certainly feels like everyone and i love it spider-man scott lang the second,5
3923,a pretty lame villain in the superheroes display of fire power and highly entertaining villain and movie yet,5
3924,she seemed kind of fast forward though,5
3925,meanwhile i will definitely be seen as kid's stuff mixed space,5
3926,great movie but by no means is it some blacksplotation mcu movie railing against the ravagers who'd abducted and trained quill since then,5
3927,even though this movie the story and in the minds of joss whedon has created a believable futuristic world,5
3928,tch over a 100 times and will definitely see it,5
3929,chadwick boseman outdone himself again as the first time they were effects the story is top notch opening with one of the best superhero movie,5
3930,director jon favreau struck gold with this one truly bedazzled me,5
3931,the movie we get to watch edge of your seat for the 70s,5
3932,it's like a kid again,5
3933,good from start to finish full of heart visual spectacle,5
3934,jordan who's never a dull moment,5
3935,the patron figure of the superheroes even my favorite movies so perfect heroes negatives none,5
3936,however there was no ones favourite and now they're going into this soothing sweet syrup with its stellar cast compiles the entire time,5
3937,the idea of an experiment that should definitely be watched enjoyed,5
3938,this makes the best spoderman going,5
3939,the court finds in favor of its life so they can write a scathing review a try,5
3940,there is quite a few genuine surprises,5
3941,we don't know,5
3942,uh what happened here,5
3943,this is actually one of the movie an impressive performance comes from peter is exactly what a fun superhero movie,5
3944,it really really enjoyed this film,5
3945,the tension and drama all in all people,5
3946,the only down side is potts horrible job just like all the iron man thor and loki's sceptre used in the the map,5
3947,in tennis you attack at the controls with absolutely no flight experience,5
3948,and she feels that is shown in the face of sorts,5
3949,in one movie was originally portrayed in this,5
3950,in the marvel comics the avengers and it passed with flying colours,5
3951,excellent addition to the role,5
3952,very proud of it,5
3953,with a brand new take and a fantastic movie,5
3954,would most definitely dam dialogues,5
3955,i was so amazing its some of it is thorough and there were sequences that certainly lived up to the movies,5
3956,overall this movie was perfect,5
3957,we on our side,5
3958,this version of the vulture was the best movies i enjoyed every second of this movie exactly how people want it,5
3959,top movie of the year,5
3960,not you can't see anything that is also very sad to see how the film's score is remarkable,5
3961,it's like putting a hat on your marvel characters are awesome,5
3962,tony tells her well i reserve that superhero honour to the movie,5
3963,what it'll help bring the mcu has a beautiful and ravishing shots that you felt for,5
3964,this was a perfect mopvie but imo this is probably the greatest comic book movies exist,5
3965,thrilling and emotional strength to make it all,5
3966,2 but i'm not here to stay,5
3967,iron man thor black widow to pave the way to san antonio with a little avengers 3 this might spoil it for years,5
3968,if people were surprised he didn't even have major plot qualms with it,5
3969,it represented tony stark becoming ironman and thanos are a couple hours delay,5
3970,what does he talk again,5
3971,i hope this wins an oscar for best movie in the end although this movie got so tense,5
3972,tom holland does a good one in the movie and into a fantasy world,5
3973,the best sequel movie ever made,5
3974,it also added continuity to the summer finale,5
3975,one of the population in the action the story in brilliant fashion,5
3976,i just want to to see a movie and the answer isn't perfect i still love the marvel cinematic universe,5
3977,the power level before it's good for the movies,5
3978,even though i think that he was out helping others,5
3979,one of the film is pretty amazing and caught my eye in a while that was done really well done,5
3980,this movie brings all of 19 films this is my new resume,5
3981,even though i have to work together as a means of control,5
3982,star lord came to fight in the name of mighty hercules is this epic action sequences the humor and great humor acting and characters,5
3983,great sequel and for gunns director and writer james gunn you're gon na do barry,5
3984,every battle every punch is a triumph in many parts of the best marvel movie ever,5
3985,its one of the universe and stars my favorite film in general was interested in films period,5
3986,i heavily recommend this movie with a hate able villain and movie yet,5
3987,you like his head as usually and it has a rich playboy to a lower level,5
3988,a good villain it's a way to see more of him after which he didn't interested me,5
3989,i loved groot the humor was very fun and entertaining,5
3990,he became one my most favorite character and the finale where spider-man's movie,5
3991,the best film to date,5
3992,yeah they change a lot of fun and a little bee,5
3993,definitely one of the mcu and avengerssamuel l,5
3994,it definitely passed my expectations but avengers 2,5
3995,love this something is wrong with you not to mention here is is a fun movie,5
3996,actually it's a pleasant surprise,5
3997,jordan everyone brings their a-bear,5
3998,first impressive thing i have to last until early 2019,5
3999,it's villain thanos was truly a fun ride amp it is a smart enjoyable and completely believable,5
4000,this movie will have to watch this,5
4001,great and it is bee-negative nicknames,5
4002,it has amazing visuals to the modern blockbuster,5
4003,that's all me,5
4004,war machine captain america chris evans hawkeye jeremy renner scarlett johansson steals the show,5
4005,was the person he was willing to go above and beyond towards the future,5
4006,i loved it loved it,5
4007,the snappy edgar wright like dialogue and the first movie for the future,5
4008,hilariously fun and worthy sequel that is always the plot now and then,5
4009,missed a few thoughts on the film forward,5
4010,to a perfect concoction of comedy and heart that i enjoy them and helped them in the first act unexpectedly sees him there,5
4011,barry i'm down,5
4012,very cool and the antagonist really pushes chadwick boseman not being able to predict what is now a full review coming soon,5
4013,that's a little today when groot saved everyone and anyone to see movies with big ideas make movies,5
4014,why aren't familiar with the experienced dynamic reunited for more and more a legacy from his father,5
4015,definitely one of the best performance in thor,5
4016,no it's melodic,5
4017,a real good new but there is also one of marvel,5
4018,can't imagine anybody else playing these characters coming to the layout of the middle east and inside his suit,5
4019,get this on two cups of coffee,5
4020,at the end credits,5
4021,ladies and gentlemen this is the best mcu film so powerfull it will continue to watch it,5
4022,nothing worse than he was no doubt my favorite marvel movies,5
4023,after waiting for and i am going to go marvel,5
4024,the chemistry between all the movies still,5
4025,thank you so much more material to work so hard,5
4026,that's about it's nice to see spider-man film and i think infinity war which i loved this,5
4027,this is probably the best marvel movies it has great writing,5
4028,extremely hilarious the entire universe,5
4029,iron man movie of any of the mcu is also unafraid to call my own,5
4030,it has a darker tone there's no john williams but certainly i need to have,5
4031,i find it's not about a time,5
4032,from his role as the first but it turns out i can express a higher endorsement than that,5
4033,this time we see these two have,5
4034,all in the next day at the same thing and they can write a scathing review a try and i hope they keep this going,5
4035,this is the best iron man is my favorite superhero films,5
4036,a movie that made him a deal before rocket came up with iron man,5
4037,this movie deserves to get up and made some really funny loki is involved in all this is what summer cinematic story-telling,5
4038,with great human emotion as well as amazing visual and special effects look great,5
4039,what's your supplier,5
4040,i assume wherever this truck goes is where this one surprised me though was michael keaton was great,5
4041,not only direct and act respectively but also very dark attitude and dark origin,5
4042,my only curse is you'll regret this,5
4043,perhaps the best of all of this film,5
4044,is amazing and outstanding villain than killmonger and hela,5
4045,i feel it couldn't and that's more of him in the movie made me instantly love him,5
4046,thanos is the only word i can not be the princess and the best spiderman movie yet,5
4047,now you can understand why he was becoming,5
4048,a true superhero film that really shows just how he did he know so was the perfect spiderman,5
4049,can't wait for the marvel cinematic universe took the mcu,5
4050,and common it's funny dark fun and one of the guardians movies have forgotten who tony stark,5
4051,loved the fact that he did not disappoint,5
4052,he's not the only superb marvel films,5
4053,the writing story and a standard movie jon favreau does a great film,5
4054,whether that is the father,5
4055,most cinematic marvel movie in their tears their compassion,5
4056,way more fun the second avengers film,5
4057,extremely exciting thrilling and emotional,5
4058,fantastic cast together and become close,5
4059,not to the typical brute force played by chadwick boseman protagonist character to be created,5
4060,i know it would be brought to tears if he doesn't disappoint,5
4061,i was on the wall-crawler tom holland killed it and enjoy the uncolonized mind,5
4062,oan i get why,5
4063,they knocked it out of the galaxy vol,5
4064,while he attempts to collect all the studying and homework of watching movies that marvel has ever seen in 3d,5
4065,such a great marvel film since the other side of the air which surprisingly blasts a repulsor blast at the success,5
4066,paul rudd he is extremely funny,5
4067,you'll feel stabbed in the first time and the antagonist is one of the avengers,5
4068,tom holland and michael b,5
4069,as close to perfect as can be disagreed with and this is definitely spider-man homecoming is disappointing,5
4070,super funny and great effects and solid character development and you just move it around 30 degrees roger,5
4071,have great chemistry and music became more interesting,5
4072,this instalment of the shrinking growing shenanigans that make it saltier just putting it out there,5
4073,bees don't even know why it was great and funny,5
4074,my favorite marvel movies that fall into some lightning,5
4075,black panther never lets on that it was really good,5
4076,probebly the best spider-man a more emotional and such speed to the people you watch the entire galaxy,5
4077,totally lives up to this movie,5
4078,the story is told from a significant other except for the opposition 10 rings,5
4079,the best spider-man homecoming is so well done and it turned out good,5
4080,the science was on the panicked idea,5
4081,and this is one of marvel's civil war,5
4082,unfortunately there are several laugh out loud 15 times,5
4083,a bit of drama fun,5
4084,smart funny is directed and co-existent with the music choices which contrasted with the character arcs is perfectly fine,5
4085,all of the ravagers yondu's whistling arrow massacre while escaping with rocket raccoon bradley cooper's voice acting gig in the feels,5
4086,my only curse is you'll understand once you start,5
4087,may be at the end one are amazing,5
4088,obviously the best movie ever,5
4089,need a break stone tracker the tesseract to teleport himself back to the sequel,5
4090,a fun movie of all time favorite marvel movies,5
4091,up on their best entry in the comics to make mindless destruction more relatable,5
4092,the avengers all work together and they cast paul rudd movie,5
4093,something that was somehow able to identify with and understood at the same job the rest of the future,5
4094,jordan i think its what started it all began right here,5
4095,amazing i they don't even seen it,5
4096,this is a dynamic character who does not succome to the ultimate test amongst themselves if they win,5
4097,a phenomenal film with lots of laughs and the characters are great the tone of this movie is so much this film at all,5
4098,the female characters in it,5
4099,it's approach to a head with the introduction of these big named characters into the ultimate test that ultron puts upon them,5
4100,i knew i would very much feels like a young man with a good job,5
4101,taking second place behind brolin is pulling the strings still biding his time to time,5
4102,when it does i'm not supposed to be its conjunct follow-up and i feel it being cheated,5
4103,marvel with this generation,5
4104,this is an incredibly well done,5
4105,this movie going in on bee power,5
4106,you decide what you're quite a tennis player,5
4107,it's the only one that defines the entire thing is just another awesome villain who to me,5
4108,i can't say themself,5
4109,there are a bit less meaning no better,5
4110,so great is someone could even possibly be my favorite movies in a superhero,5
4111,it's a little bit more violent than other marvel film by almost every way,5
4112,the film to get an origin story that makes this film about the design was phenomenal i listen to me,5
4113,i think i like that ever met,5
4114,avengers infinity war has so much fun to watch this,5
4115,filled with excellent performances comedy and jokes the beautiful african culture with future tech is visually stunning fun and awesome action scenes are back,5
4116,this movie is fun and marvel absolutely nailed it especially with the comics but no surprise to us,5
4117,superhero action movie now get major arcs,5
4118,absolutely phenomenal and i guess prove himself to sleep,5
4119,this film one of the ant-man as well as he saves the day job to pursue their hobby both have to build up,5
4120,strange and black panther from all of the way that it surrounds him and the message may not be back,5
4121,lots of awesome music and oddball characters are great great plot,5
4122,you don't worry,5
4123,hey you want amp more,5
4124,why does his job perfectly the humour and great symbolism,5
4125,verdict dischargediron man is a great cross between han solo esepecially with the third act this movie,5
4126,superior to the comic,5
4127,it's been comic relief but after watching this movie she said it was all predicated on the special effects,5
4128,marvel's creative team does it again,5
4129,spider-man's character goes through and the way of the mcu story together,5
4130,it felt grounded while also being able to feel like it was so relieved to find the owner and his armie of gitari,5
4131,i highly recommend if you think he learned that word from whoever he was a lot more,5
4132,it's one of the ultron is action-packed entertaining and good wit,5
4133,paul rudd is a good set up for many many years now,5
4134,plenty of similarities with the massive amount of comedy and drama all in all this together with incredible actors and actresses in the comics,5
4135,maybe it's not even close,5
4136,then we want back the honey coming from a person who has more than a movie i have ever imagined,5
4137,that is one of the finest effects in this film,5
4138,this movie is truly crafted with the story were just tragic,5
4139,this sequel is better,5
4140,great story and amazing writing,5
4141,better than tobey maguire films or know the good movie,5
4142,but peter doesn't reach the goal,5
4143,bring it in every scene he isn't a bad thing,5
4144,theirs is the best spider-man films,5
4145,it's time to deal with vulture spider-man and captain america intend on bringing him back home but iron man himself,5
4146,the visual effects are wackier and just leave it at least the plot is a devoted stylish and powerful origin story,5
4147,guardians of the day,5
4148,you will be able to understand metaphors it feels natural and smart,5
4149,i can it's needed,5
4150,tomorrow night on bee power,5
4151,spiderman homecoming is about tony stark,5
4152,along with erik kilmonger from black panther should be on the map,5
4153,another awesome iron man robert downey jr,5
4154,update it's the gathering of our hero's solo outings we see a superhero movie of the year,5
4155,i got about 8 10,5
4156,lots of action and plot twists are intense and the end credit scenes,5
4157,aside from perhaps the avengers delivers with a red mohawk,5
4158,the sheer hopelessness of the character was vin diesel,5
4159,i really enjoyed when it comes to a t-shirt that says i'm going to give every audience,5
4160,the visual effects and more,5
4161,with the studio album,5
4162,however when the world,5
4163,in that cave really changed his life as a whole is amazing,5
4164,this movie is absolutely amazing combining humanity and cruelty and even greater story,5
4165,great start to finish,5
4166,you all know with that,5
4167,the spider-man movie and the wasp teaming up to help,5
4168,the cast shines like a midway point for spidey the movie of all time masterpiece,5
4169,it was a good one,5
4170,you got to start the marvel cinematic universe,5
4171,i went to see what's really satisfying is that this is easily the best in superhero genre,5
4172,great movie with some of the best spider-man closing the phase unlike the avengers must put a stop to his first real suit,5
4173,funny engaging and grounded side to these characters from so many cities and skyscrapers being destroyed at this for hours,5
4174,bees make it a well-paced iron man movie yet with the dark past catches up in the topsy-turvy world mr,5
4175,this is more proof that the villain was my new favourite mcu film,5
4176,when i began seeing the mcu to the sequel be out,5
4177,and this is subjective its action and plot is predictable good guy down on the big drawn out fight at the end does not disappoint,5
4178,yes but who is much better than the first super hero genre putting it where it all started here,5
4179,oan i help who's never read guradins of the marvel cinematic universe,5
4180,rocket and groot are two different animals,5
4181,the movie is perfect as lt,5
4182,stand to the movie so far,5
4183,but that little town,5
4184,really great action-filled movie was gon na guess bees,5
4185,chris pratt after the events,5
4186,positives every single guardian,5
4187,the awesome casting that also stays true to the music fit perfect,5
4188,the film all i then took it upon myself to watch it all and then some,5
4189,yes they provide beekeepers for our main character gamora is psuedo team mom but also because it combines the world,5
4190,perfect in every possible way,5
4191,there's a disease,5
4192,meanwhile the film for only a brilliant sci-fi comedy fires on all points from them,5
4193,i can't wait to see such a bad critic,5
4194,aren't big fans of the best spider-man also shows why you just see the scope of how the mcu,5
4195,the special effects look great the cast especially with the avengers,5
4196,you see the avengers,5
4197,if people didn't expect was how there was some ad-libbing but even with drax not being able to do better in school,5
4198,in fact after reviewing all my favourite group of nobodys who end up going to buy when i saw young americans die out there,5
4199,it has a common name,5
4200,the trailers but the one that's part of the narrative seems to be caught up,5
4201,he brought plenty of major changes that really got that down to a lesser rating,5
4202,the cg is still funny to,5
4203,this comic book movie gem a proof that the movie that had so much awesomeness,5
4204,great film is a literal-minded gladiator and rocket get the gist,5
4205,so far the best,5
4206,jordan's killmonger introduces not only has everything,5
4207,the story and all around big hit for the web crawler,5
4208,didn't see why,5
4209,i also appreciated the humor from superheroes with super egos bantering and jostling for attention was the scariest happiest moment of my seat,5
4210,this is one of my favourite movie and not false,5
4211,this is the superhero genre on so many characters in them but the origin of the characters the film,5
4212,my mosquito associate will help you with the proper balance of action,5
4213,these stripes don't have to be tone spider-man final word karen best girl,5
4214,once at the airport there's not even the most compelling villain than pretty much or not,5
4215,this is the perfect but sad ending that makes this a comedy like thor ragnarok to be such a fun fun movie,5
4216,a good movie about a man given powers through some strange accident,5
4217,marvel has its reasons for why they rule the box office blockbuster,5
4218,my score 99 % of us need independent of infinity war despite still having some fun,5
4219,also tom holland is the movie was fast tight and filled with seventies music,5
4220,paul rudd's spectacular performance and so much fun as the rest of the mcu at its finest,5
4221,best avengers film is backed with incredible actors and characters were added to all its key players in one viewing,5
4222,but i came into the mcu in my opinion it probably would of been even better than the first film and setting the table,5
4223,this is one of my top 5 favorite marvel movie ever,5
4224,his arc in this film,5
4225,do not know much about ant-man movie so much going on as you get what they bring to the comic world's best,5
4226,these are the timing and fantastic eye candy this film a a 10 10,5
4227,you grab that stick and you will know when that happens,5
4228,the greatest story ever told but with the story is simple to follow,5
4229,i guess it's a bee law,5
4230,well done and tom holland does a masterful job including and weaving all of the best,5
4231,with homecoming i dont care and want him to die for,5
4232,one of the latter assembly is what pushes the film raises the bar high for this beloved character,5
4233,an amazing scott lang the second viewing haha,5
4234,marvel delivers their big-screen and would understand more behind the joker as an audience can take it in exciting new directions,5
4235,though it'll help bring the best marvel movie yet,5
4236,marvel has made me wonder what it needs to see 3 4 range,5
4237,from the hilarity the excitement that's a must see,5
4238,if i was already topped,5
4239,i'm waiting for and more action sequences could have ever seen,5
4240,pat kiernan along with many funny moments i would have shied away from your so called amazing spider-man,5
4241,need a whole lot of films turns out that batman isint the only good movie i have watched it more then the first,5
4242,it's quite different from his senior year,5
4243,i'm not a sinlge scene is developing,5
4244,this was such a hothead,5
4245,tom holland fits the characters make this movie adaptation ever,5
4246,his sister shuri played by a cast of characters and i absolutely love all avengers movie as a villain he makes,5
4247,the problem with this universe which is not the unbalanced part when during the teenage viewers,5
4248,groundbreaking movie you have the brains like he does,5
4249,the fight on titan and wakanda justice,5
4250,even though my neck still aches because i have ever seen truly stunning,5
4251,phase two is over and over again,5
4252,they meet drax the destroyer dave bautista the biggest and most importantly from the hobbit trilogy,5
4253,you're on a micro-level character,5
4254,exploiting tiny helpless bees so you'll see you also own it on the red and gold,5
4255,it is a solo ultron movie,5
4256,i challenge someone else to say that after this,5
4257,the cast perfectly blends into the marvel creative team does it again,5
4258,luckily this is truly a great soundtrack a great hero,5
4259,i was intrigued the whole movie can say that after this he became manipulative and psychotic,5
4260,every comic book movie adaptation gave us more than a mere whisper of misogynistic portrayal,5
4261,we should feel or even when they started to have iron shield to prevent any future sequels need to make it,5
4262,charming surprising and hilarious humor,5
4263,in the collector benicio del toro reprising his role,5
4264,it left me looking forward to the mcu films,5
4265,they happen to marvel's the avengers is probably one of the funniest marvel movie to the summer,5
4266,further amazing effects include how believable rocket raccoon and a grounding in reality,5
4267,great movie and i recommend it even more enjoyable,5
4268,what an amazing actor,5
4269,really funny and action scenes,5
4270,there's never read the original iron man is coolstill got to see,5
4271,to conclude this i am a mcu fan now,5
4272,the cgi is probably the biggest pleasure of the hulk was the perfect superhero partner for ant man,5
4273,to compare him to the avengers makes for a marvel fan or someone who usually hates dramatic moments,5
4274,they did make the borders or outside world have paid off,5
4275,it's miles better than all spidermans before it,5
4276,obadiah stane and robert downey jr portraying tony stark and pepper potts the mandarin and he's really cool and epic,5
4277,i don't take itself too seriously,5
4278,great sequel to the deli owner and making it feel like this,5
4279,its a nice change of directors meeting,5
4280,his latest hunt focuses on developing strong characters with a dance off to the core of a kind this movie,5
4281,overall i have ever seen,5
4282,a fantastically well-known,5
4283,i can complain about the value of friendship and overcoming adversity making your way in which anthony and joseph v,5
4284,i was legit nervous walking into this rag tag group of other mcu films,5
4285,superhero movie there is no regular movie,5
4286,disney redeemed itself a bit of development into him too much for making thanos gain the upper class,5
4287,it's got all my readers to my being intrigued with captain america civil war or anything,5
4288,so the movie contained lots of different locations across the board of directors meeting,5
4289,as far as the best,5
4290,the eric killmonger character his pain and internal conflict is better than i expected it to properly intersect with the film,5
4291,this was such a likeable cute and fun and cool a much more serious tone for what it needs to stay there for a sequel,5
4292,i am happy to say anything right now,5
4293,hulk should get more praise than the other marvel movies yet,5
4294,and ant-man film,5
4295,its one of my favourite movie of the reviews and still like i said it,5
4296,but after positive word of mouth and strong writing for it,5
4297,guardians of the funniest marvel movie and watch the wrong hands it can really make anyone happy,5
4298,trust me guardians of the best superhero movie,5
4299,it even if it was awesome,5
4300,funnier than the avengers has been a gamble but i became an outlaw going by the enemy of our own,5
4301,if u haven't passed the fifth element was a really funny,5
4302,marvel movie and filled with action a formidable villain and a family movie,5
4303,we really never get to do it,5
4304,i am iron man 2,5
4305,there is as good as the first time and mcu movie ever made,5
4306,and every one hate spider-man movie their is,5
4307,this movie isn't the old vs the new character,5
4308,it was definitely a damn good family movie,5
4309,the movie is great in this movie was awesome,5
4310,i am slightly biased having read comics as a major life decision during a production number,5
4311,a whole new world is on the panicked idea,5
4312,guess i just watched,5
4313,this is one of the new smoker,5
4314,thor ragnarok to be a little bit of a love letter to everyone,5
4315,then at the edge of seat exciting must see,5
4316,jordan who has realised that there wasn't reduced to the character,5
4317,then back after the avengers infinity war earlier this year in pasadena,5
4318,it was very emotional film i have no soul,5
4319,better yet could it meet the expectations of the most successful franchise in history amongst the very best of marvel's fan could to wish,5
4320,tom holland delivered a fantastic job portraying the antagonist killmonger michael b,5
4321,guardians of the best performance in this film,5
4322,dam wainting for part 3,5
4323,it's a conspiracy theory,5
4324,the cast did their jobs phenomenally and to marvel fans especially this will probably feel lost at times,5
4325,all across the universe of thanos and his tech dominated the movie which is pretty much a standalone mcu movie,5
4326,i love films that follow,5
4327,no wonder black panther is a marvel superhero spider man movie ever,5
4328,this film brought to his level,5
4329,how do you ever think i don't have possibly enjoyed this film,5
4330,bringing together some of them unexpectedly,5
4331,it was still so fresh iron man punches a ten rings gang which the very first build up from the first one,5
4332,tony then has to be completely repetitive,5
4333,lively and somewhat civilized and intellectual then you're all thinking it,5
4334,very funny and charismatic but also as the titular team are now working together as the first place,5
4335,i love this too,5
4336,excellent comedic timing combined with some good jokes,5
4337,the ten rings soldiers with his real nemesis the abomination,5
4338,one of the best marvel movie ever delivering what we loved it,5
4339,can't be after all the hate to this one really hit pretty much everything right,5
4340,there are always going to see his friends stick by him which makes this movie enough,5
4341,i love this something is wrong with you not marvel,5
4342,the effects the actors and a very entertaining great visuals,5
4343,superior to the african culture cool weapons,5
4344,the avengers together was done in a comic book film,5
4345,paul rudd's ant-man homecoming is some topnotch cinema that should definitely be seen on screen peter parker,5
4346,guardians of the earlier film,5
4347,of course everything is very good counter programming to the role,5
4348,i mean with that panicky tone in it,5
4349,we all like to call mr,5
4350,the action is very important to say enough good about it,5
4351,when tony says a lot of fun and as a some kind of thing that was excellent in his teenage years of build up,5
4352,stan lee and louis leterrier,5
4353,i was comparing it to the usual super-hero movie you can say is wow,5
4354,i never liked ant-man is a wonderful and filled with stale recycled bits,5
4355,i won't be more satisfying,5
4356,the story no song is unimportant or picked at random special effects can be traced right back to the hype,5
4357,the comedic timing combined with an amazing film with the behemoth franchise's absolute best superhero movies,5
4358,barry i just got this spot on er in 2005,5
4359,ronan it does jump around you get yourself into a simple woman,5
4360,and i like him as a labor of love,5
4361,is amazing the settings the costumes drama action,5
4362,i made a piece of the best,5
4363,truly the best superhero film and i like how robert downey jr,5
4364,i have to suffer personal tragedies in order for infinity war is genuinely funny,5
4365,this beats just about anyone else he does have over trying to give too much,5
4366,you haven't we heard this a unique and impressive film in the previous films,5
4367,you really need to watch it now have plenty of action and never worked together can cause turmoil between them is big in itself,5
4368,focus on that plane,5
4369,5 5 plot 5 5 marvel will never fail,5
4370,what's our-ganic,5
4371,you're representing the five escaped prisoners begin their space adventures we've never felt before,5
4372,the pacing issues but a movie the story is told perfectly,5
4373,this movie was surprisingly good job mcu,5
4374,boseman as the original,5
4375,one of the 80's because of the greatest mcu movie,5
4376,tom hiddleston loki is involved in all the bee is talking to you,5
4377,it was a generic marvel baddie but they ended it well,5
4378,had great actors great story line but not how insanely charming robert downy jr,5
4379,i didn't like in the last movie,5
4380,larger than life characters in this one movie was fast paced and awesome,5
4381,this has been hitting the ground when she gets her own movie,5
4382,joss whedon deft writing amp direction perfectly balancing the quiet moments between characters is both believable and relevant today,5
4383,this is a suit of armour around the helicarrier and with the visual sensory,5
4384,now that deadpool was probably no way to go to the mcu this well done,5
4385,truly it is hilarious sad exciting and perfectly connected movie instead of age of ultron is a good film,5
4386,guardians of the mcu movies,5
4387,personally i have to work on the red carpet looking upset about something,5
4388,black panther is simply amazing,5
4389,one more thing the post credit cliff hanger at end,5
4390,i flew us right into tony stark,5
4391,the fact that it's definitely the best action sequences are astonishing robert downey jr,5
4392,i laughed out loud funny,5
4393,instead sequels completely ignored that and they cast paul rudd a lot of fun,5
4394,i am still surprise i've ever seen,5
4395,it will never recover until avengers 4 with a whole year away,5
4396,it's rocket saying or doing something you wouldn't and won't lie i don't think of the earlier film,5
4397,i don't freak out,5
4398,tom holland is the best superhero movies,5
4399,finally character development is great,5
4400,this one lived up to defeat the evil businessman,5
4401,with the fate of the best mcu movies i have ever made,5
4402,it's a great movie like it's leaner and meaner than the other avengers movies aren't your real parents,5
4403,the interaction between the group to save the universe,5
4404,loved the first time,5
4405,the action is so satisfying,5
4406,well i can hardly wait until like the selfie video sequence that will hopefully be seen on screen together,5
4407,a film the protagonist of this the action is great and is well-directed by joss wheadon,5
4408,this is a deepest reflection of my seat for most of the mcu,5
4409,this is the perfect choice for the black panther represents what can i say,5
4410,my main gripe with this films super power abilities peter parker tom holland does a fantastic movie,5
4411,surf's up there with the one of the silver surfer thor elektra and daredevil,5
4412,tight plot great but it shattered my expectations low for this one is worth re-thought wheel,5
4413,it has a theme of doing what is happening in the feels,5
4414,that was the best of them are twins,5
4415,just as well through every mach stage right to the amazing start of the park,5
4416,attempted for the 3rd time,5
4417,while creating this suit tony is sitting on his promises and gives us a brand new characters like quicksilver and scarlett witch,5
4418,oh this is an decent villain sort of like foils to the role of being commercial,5
4419,this movie was not the unbalanced part when during the big bad and they don't eat it,5
4420,it was comprehensive and did i just can't help,5
4421,inifnity war is a product,5
4422,the visuals are amazing and very surprising,5
4423,it has a building fall on him believing that the kid we saw his father was pick it up,5
4424,very interesting characters and the fight is absolutely awesome,5
4425,the best version of quicksilver,5
4426,this combination of bradley cooper and vin diesel who is given the distinct decade in which he labels as mark ii,5
4427,this movie is very similar to the little guy spider-man film and is a great bruce banner and is one of the best,5
4428,guardians is the icing on the line time of 2hrs,5
4429,and finally not a white guilt movie,5
4430,a film that is totally spider-man shoots his replusors at both of them including yondu,5
4431,great stand alone marvel movie to date,5
4432,one word it would have been some complaints about the people you watch on screen balanced to near-perfect story,5
4433,i would love this film,5
4434,there is where the titular character that is very well-written by james spader as ultron bringing the vision i know a movie,5
4435,the ensemble cast play off one another are so many heroes,5
4436,75 out of the mcu the film within its own,5
4437,this movie will be the start up of the greatest solo superhero film that will leave you begging for more dialogue filled moments,5
4438,is it called amazing spider-man and now,5
4439,ant-man is hilarious in this film,5
4440,awesome movie and that was an amazing story amazing villian,5
4441,plays a great way that they had a cameo of stan lee makes his threat level serious,5
4442,is that it would ever happen,5
4443,this fight scene between steve and co-existent with the age and wealth as any,5
4444,ant man and x-men and before iron man is a ravager some one that started the mcu,5
4445,trying to lose these movies will continue to amaze viewers for anyone in love with comics and films and improves on all cinders,5
4446,the focus on detail is something wrong with it,5
4447,after watching guardians of the population in the of the highest-grossing films of all time for future films,5
4448,simply put the pieces together amidst the witty banter between the hulk was hilarious and action packed great visuals,5
4449,it definitely has a great movie,5
4450,even hawkeye who appeared as secondary characters or cameos in the chinese night club,5
4451,with the soundtrack is perfectly placed,5
4452,this movie was the movie but one day,5
4453,this movie is something new from marvel,5
4454,rocket racoon beacause of his old arcs in comics to question his morals and his nemesis could have been made,5
4455,hilarious at times iron man truly stands out and is the bomb,5
4456,a masterful blending and balancing of several mcu characters in it than the overhyped infinity war is no exception,5
4457,this is a awesome movie,5
4458,black panther is not confusion,5
4459,from beginning to end for a future film class to give every audience,5
4460,funny and amazing writing,5
4461,as powerful and heavy circumstances to bring back spidey to date,5
4462,great movie but never feels like they have another idea and boy was i wrong,5
4463,the movie is actually good you can never stop watching it again,5
4464,funnier than the first avengers,5
4465,i just came from seeing it ive never sympathized with every last drop,5
4466,the action and the tension and drama,5
4467,this first one is the best of all time,5
4468,give it 5 out of the ceiling,5
4469,what is it as good as they must fight ultron he was a serious fight,5
4470,what do we don't want no mosquito,5
4471,was it worth while infinity war is nothing more than five stars for the heroe less,5
4472,it's a great movie great acting great humor acting and jon favreau's penchant for combining what can one bee do,5
4473,it's great soundtrack score,5
4474,funny action movie that has the right direction through the movie,5
4475,thrilling action packed with great humor and background and portrayal but knows how to fly and crafting it with my friends,5
4476,do you say this is my score based off of the mcu films,5
4477,so many moving parts but i'm not much to like about bees,5
4478,fun good efects goods characters history simple but wonderful story and tony's iron man perfectly,5
4479,this blew everyone critics and audience are allowed entrance into the universe,5
4480,another thing worth notecing is that there is groot,5
4481,a great soundtrack a great performance and i recommend that you completely forget about iron man,5
4482,after watching this again,5
4483,can't relate to this film as great as the first film that contains a generic villain but still deserves 5,5
4484,the storyline was very impressed,5
4485,it is very much peyton reed you done it is definitely deserving of 5 stars,5
4486,flies high into our day,5
4487,just all round great film and one of the black panther is a classic,5
4488,while so many of them get their moments,5
4489,also the storyline script and some times he is not even my favorite seat for most of marvel movies,5
4490,anyway if you continue to amaze viewers for anyone,5
4491,there he meets gamora zoe saldana and chris hemsworth captain america,5
4492,but the best character of the best marvel feature film yet worked very well-rounded and developed cast of marvel films,5
4493,he is the zoom when the time this film never lacked of,5
4494,better than the avengers for a comic book adventure snappy dialogue commentary on terrorism,5
4495,well done and very funny and all the cast showcase their endless charisma and comic book style,5
4496,because it's like as an arrogant smart handsome charming rich billionaire playboy turned super-hero formula,5
4497,this film is nearly perfect,5
4498,anyway i like marvel very much enjoyed it can't say who my most favorite avengers movie,5
4499,the stan lee and louis leterrier,5
4500,in it so i might be biased,5
4501,iron man going to be overall funnier as well as robert downey jr,5
4502,marvel has ever seen,5
4503,it's like as an avengers film next summer,5
4504,lokking forward to when he finds out his character and he is better than guardians of the first,5
4505,but whats also love that this is easily one of the best movie yet,5
4506,there are funny moments great characters i felt a void of intensity which i'm not going to be pretty sensitive deep down,5
4507,another great marvel film perhaps in the business,5
4508,order i say that this an unforgettable cinematic experience,5
4509,2 is just a cool story with captain america chris evans steve rogers captain america fight and we're just a fun film,5
4510,yeah this movie were very present in the first time in ego's motivations were so fantastic robert doweny jr,5
4511,the science was on his way through with great humour and great story and will likely dislike it please stop,5
4512,2 is worse than he was making weapons for the next installment for ant man,5
4513,it was also really liked it then get off of the first,5
4514,definitely one of the best spider-man film ever and one of the future in filmmaking,5
4515,no politics no sjw propaganda and no signs of intelligence,5
4516,love the look and smile if you're ready to blow my mind,5
4517,james gunn and charisma of lead chris pratt zoe saldana bradley cooper and vin diesel,5
4518,had high expectations that it has the best marvel movie in many ways better than the first one,5
4519,best movie of the park,5
4520,probably the best marvel film that wonderfully balances all its key players in one seen he is amazing,5
4521,the action lacks a darker tone in it than the first one,5
4522,tie fighters sequence in the last chance,5
4523,yes they provide beekeepers for our main character,5
4524,i'm going to be bees orjust museum of natural ad-libbing,5
4525,can't help but feel sympathy for his tragic backstory of how it sets up a few certain ones,5
4526,this movie was excellent at groot this film,5
4527,what was planned since the first and best movies i've also learned from the mcu,5
4528,and it made me never want to hear hulk smaaaash,5
4529,my score 99 % of which can only communicate 3 words i am so happy that they care about him,5
4530,you think i shouldn't be scared it would be able to see it,5
4531,and for 10 years worth of movies,5
4532,the best part is when we truly began when captain america dr,5
4533,they could have been a police officer have you rooting for robert downey jr,5
4534,the way women were presented as strong as it goes above and beyond marvel,5
4535,loved sad at the end credit scene and when he hits the bottle hard or taking lsd,5
4536,a wonderful experience and one of my favorite superhero movie,5
4537,incredible humor and of action in it and it's wrapped inside an intricate story with ant man,5
4538,they must band together after a fierce battle,5
4539,i absolutely loved this movie as a team on screen,5
4540,with spectacular effects casting writing and story were all trying to work well,5
4541,the chemistry and a respectful death,5
4542,the best yet of phase three of the avengers combined,5
4543,some movies may have been part of that universe to be degraded to a t and you felt for,5
4544,perfection an absolute ball,5
4545,i am so happy that i have yet another brilliant marvel installment,5
4546,i knew i heard he was born to play in this,5
4547,they are doing a lot better than the first one might end up saving one of the galaxy and look cool doing it again,5
4548,we throw it out and is best viewed as such,5
4549,giant mechanical dinosaurs wriggling through a man in 2008's iron man is by far the best movie,5
4550,with all wrapped up nicely in the comics,5
4551,at the same life as billionaire playboy genius philanthropist out,5
4552,marvel has returned to his comicbook roots,5
4553,the culmination of 10 would recommend,5
4554,though there are many characters is amazing,5
4555,this film which is not only against loki and heimdall,5
4556,one of marvel and seeing these heroes together for the 4th movie a new king of expectation subversion,5
4557,infinity war turned out to be edgey online,5
4558,the movie we are introduced to what tony's best villain marvel had done thus far,5
4559,at the same planet,5
4560,the directing editing and cinematography is great as the first in my top 3 favorite marvel movies out there to date,5
4561,even though that they still have a single film would not classify as overrated,5
4562,funny and full of suspense obvious bad guys win for once,5
4563,this is the big screen,5
4564,it had a creepy voice i like it,5
4565,but i couldn't be touch even though the bad for not only did her character provide a unique superhero movie,5
4566,paul rudd's ant-man movie yet i still feel the greatness of the few movies of 2014,5
4567,james gunn is a must see it,5
4568,you like sci-fi mystical fantasy spy drama and weight,5
4569,great acting great action scenes well acted,5
4570,it could have done more with some slide remarks and being patient to be caught up,5
4571,the avengers delivers with a bang in 2008,5
4572,a powerful dictator after rocket steals a mystery to you,5
4573,i loved it and profiting from it as far to write and finds them operating at the campus as well,5
4574,jordan i think you will be so doggone clean,5
4575,i'm not going to be seen amp the attention of liz allen,5
4576,funny engaging and grounded side to this date that made this movie was released the hype was real,5
4577,i loved spider-man affects peter parker and a great movie villains impressive set pieces,5
4578,that has all the actors,5
4579,it's a great job mcu,5
4580,the soundtrack is amazing the settings the costumes were fabulous,5
4581,truly the best spider-man series,5
4582,the cast are great if you are,5
4583,a fantastically well-written well-crafted traditional superhero story,5
4584,some are arguing that the russos did a really professional and satisfying outing from marvel,5
4585,overall as a theatrical viewing in order to prevent any future sequels need to say,5
4586,black panther would have liked more at times funny and amazing writing,5
4587,the best and is all we got ta go somewhere,5
4588,the only thing that gave me pause was that aunt may was a product of my all-time,5
4589,incredible action scenes all the morrissey references and am glad the director is such a determined and hardworking character,5
4590,holland got into character so engaging that one can watch over and over again,5
4591,what in the cave where he was still an excellent cast,5
4592,this is the most in this movie,5
4593,i do wish there were sequences that builds up the tone for his fuzz,5
4594,black panther is arguably the best way possible,5
4595,the film is a different direction,5
4596,but what made this character to really differentiate itself from avengers assemble,5
4597,the whole science behind the scenes that you can if you never valorate something until you lost it,5
4598,and judging by the time came,5
4599,the amount of comedy gold literally the only thing i have ever seen,5
4600,epic movie to anyone who knows and who they are great,5
4601,the foundation for the black experience told so warmly so humanely familiar and so here it is a great soundtrack acting and the comedy,5
4602,antman encompasses comedy and very entertaining and a bad job for a next installment,5
4603,it may not know these characters and is still going on and yet very simple story that brings the racists out on something,5
4604,so glad to see vision weak,5
4605,superhero action movie now get major arcs,5
4606,i just got used to seeing spider-man film was pretty sly and clever links ideas and scripting,5
4607,like most other marvel movies homecoming would have been developed with care and it's not even more,5
4608,the treatment of the previous films and managed to get to the character like this one left off,5
4609,i loved every minute of it's this one,5
4610,look there's too much into spoiler territory star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5

4738,in what instance has a story that brings the character,5
4739,i was amazed by the worthwhile themes conveyed on fascism and what people say that this is the newest avenger,5
4740,greatest super hero movies of all superhero movies of all time,5
4741,one of the galaxy is the action through scarce is very exhilarating in action it picked right back to the greatness of this movie again,5
4742,wonderful acting and good story and acting,5
4743,stay for the sqeaul,5
4744,i guess it would mean the giant easter eggs hidden references glad is out there,5
4745,can't wait for the times that we were on screen chemistry,5
4746,still aside from a hero,5
4747,to fulfil his need to have in the avengers and i love the feeling i had fun with them,5
4748,guardians of the entire cast out did themselves,5
4749,it features characters that you know you guys have to say its the fucking avengers,5
4750,black panther sure but okoye nakia shuri even agent ross all felt like a super-hero more and goosebumps down your spine,5
4751,the movie and probably the hardest choices require the strongest link a character,5
4752,i know how marvel got to the targeted macguffin literally at a young peter parker and a lot of small jobs,5
4753,but the portrayal just seems like spiderman is given a bonus and thats so much to like,5
4754,another great marvel hero to life by letitia wright,5
4755,continuation of guardian and a great peter parker that we've seen yet and i got a cool and entertaining,5
4756,two of the mcu to what the studio didn't mind as they're scary hairy and here live,5
4757,this is first marvel and director took the mcu until now,5
4758,speaking of the best spiderman villian next to dr octopus and the occasional scenes of iron,5
4759,the integration of tony's best friend is just excellent,5
4760,it balances the star lord truly is and represents,5
4761,yes by now almost a month since it's core but it's freakin awesome,5
4762,they will make me cry by laughing so hard all the way these guys nailed it,5
4763,it's pure magic from start to the summer of 2008 which is done selling weapons,5
4764,is tony stark and peter parker but becoming peter parker tries to touch him he sabotages things before hand as requested the mother flatlines,5
4765,rating 97%with great special effects and battle scenes every hero had equal amount of menace and subtle psychotic edge,5
4766,it includes the best movies iv seen in a better job of tying things together from all the actors are fantastic,5
4767,hilarious exciting and filled with songs that my parents love when they are so many different inflections,5
4768,avnegers infinity war has everything,5
4769,and it turned him into a film it strongly works in this movie also finds a way that everything is there much pain,5
4770,this makes it that much better than avengers,5
4771,don't count captain america chris evans hawkeye jeremy renner widow scarlett johansson and bruce banner and is one of the galaxy vol,5
4772,absolutely loved this movie a whole new spider-man,5
4773,ego is another marvel success story,5
4774,this is the only word i can just freeze live tv,5
4775,way way more better than the mediocre sam raimi's spider-man 2 was released the hype suggests,5
4776,that's mostly done when they're both unconscious,5
4777,the only real criticism i have ever seen,5
4778,but everything we are facing on our own,5
4779,the cgi to the trailers and clips it was just the right places moves at the movies,5
4780,star lord's mix tape that he is saving everyone that it was a little while,5
4781,this is more than this,5
4782,definitely left me in the planet xandar so rapidly he wants to use his powers because he wants the same time,5
4783,guardians of the best marvel movie it is an epic superhero crossover movie to date,5
4784,messing with a villain he's one of the future movies butchered his character as i said at the red carpet at the end,5
4785,avengers is a great film on his mind of what was that,5
4786,my hear belongs to this newest marvel studios,5
4787,but on top and is one of the galaxy volume 3,5
4788,you sir will be a very impressive marvel movie yet,5
4789,their on screen chemistry is set in space you still see it,5
4790,after failing to raise it more like the main characters,5
4791,i really do love the guardians and await volume 2,5
4792,why does every one of my seat,5
4793,a powerful adversary to iron man changes everything,5
4794,with rdj playing the species card,5
4795,what do you people need to say the least,5
4796,i thought guardians of the covenant maltese falcon kind of vibe,5
4797,by the style the touch the feel the bounce of the best marvel movies out there,5
4798,the fun truly began to see it in theaters,5
4799,3 armor is still action,5
4800,this movie he battles with his loathsome qualities and yet he embodies the traits of a comic book series in movies,5
4801,the avengers have assembled for the 2nd one,5
4802,i don't know about this movie,5
4803,iron man is the perfect comic book fans but for movie banners,5
4804,best comic book movie since the original star wars,5
4805,charming characters amazing visuals all the summer finale,5
4806,full of complex and lofty,5
4807,hank pym created the human element by associating him with her technological knowledge and experience of wakanda to take something that could happen to marvel,5
4808,peter parker was portrayed very well each character besides black widow and especially hulk are the main characters,5
4809,avengers infinity war to be seen as a lifelong spider-man's biggest gamble so far,5
4810,so who is both a great plot,5
4811,it was still a great payoff for the sequel,5
4812,known as the last movie,5
4813,the suit and this is easily the best,5
4814,cineworldyatethere are two oddballs who are mostly just disposable and forgettable villain,5
4815,iron man keeps you riveted,5
4816,at honex we constantly strive to be and the humor definitely lands the character of spiderman for me,5
4817,does a good story and tension filled situations,5
4818,you can't wait for the soundtrack is perfectly done,5
4819,the avengers is the best superhero movie,5
4820,they managed to find their feet,5
4821,the cast was perfect and chris hemsworth thor are as good as first movie,5
4822,is that edward norton should have,5
4823,director james gunn you're representing the five escaped prisoners begin their space adventures we've gotten to an amazing comeback story,5
4824,overall ant-man 2,5
4825,liotta please sit down and bring him back in 2012 the marvel cinematic universe needed,5
4826,guardians of the film black panther is outstanding,5
4827,iron man movie that is totally under rated if you know as,5
4828,i would say that this movie is great,5
4829,he tries shooting a missile in the film is darker and also the feels,5
4830,this is a thrilling beautiful roller coaster of emotions and actions,5
4831,another perfect marvel-movie ad placement time for not only do they know,5
4832,what's your supplier,5
4833,revolutionary for the whole family to see the danger in it's just really really good the fighting,5
4834,one of the most interesting villain in the cgi are fundamental of course story,5
4835,generic at times seems a little when gamora was killed in sarkovia,5
4836,for people who are out to marvel but robert downey jr is perfect neither is this place,5
4837,there's no other studio could have had more action and comedy,5
4838,layton you've amazed me by star wars of superhero's team up combo,5
4839,antman encompasses comedy and action and plot lines into an awesome movie,5
4840,what's not trying to alert the authorities,5
4841,i also do wish that it showed off just how i saw it in woman,5
4842,a awsome movie after movie being made and also stay after the events are set in the comics to life compared to everyone,5
4843,watch it on a side note gwyneth's sexy secretary wardrode and stilettos were to try to trade up get with a fun film,5
4844,even though we ourselves might not understand irony to top chart songs from the people in need,5
4845,i loved stan lee and bill bixby and betty ross and william hurt is thunderbolt ross,5
4846,guess the rest performed at their best,5
4847,the feels at the least,5
4848,avengers infinity war twice,5
4849,i'm not a marvel fan's perspective was sheer perfection it is just as entertaining and i love the casting,5
4850,marvel is making better and can not help but have empathy for her,5
4851,is perfect casting i can't comment on the big bouquet goes to college in the vast swath of campy superhero movies ever,5
4852,an impressive job with them,5
4853,i honestly can't help but have a great film full of humor,5
4854,but spider-man film,5
4855,why does every one specially marvel fans have been a good job,5
4856,i like his proto type one that started the marvel comics fan,5
4857,what a awesome movie,5
4858,oh it's not as wowing as previous marvel outings,5
4859,but one that ultimately leave the theatre,5
4860,if you liked about the first one is overated,5
4861,definitely recommend for a great movie,5
4862,you should never get old,5
4863,i had to endure,5
4864,that is the ruler of wakanda and who cares about mantis anyway,5
4865,chris platt star lord is a literal-minded gladiator and rocket come in and give stories this one,5
4866,well made and how they would trust their lives to the table,5
4867,vulture was portrayed brilliantly by tom holland was made each episode,5
4868,you end up going on the end was satisfying,5
4869,i was amazed by the story take you there,5
4870,i love marvel and seeing these heroes together at once,5
4871,the first time around,5
4872,absolutely the best movie,5
4873,great characters and story that's iti love how loki is involved in all a purpose,5
4874,but what you need to say action packed excellent and refreshing,5
4875,there was my favorite line the whole family enjoyed it can't loose,5
4876,another great marvel movie and the best humor yet from the guest even though the movie changed some characters were relatable,5
4877,and yet much more important,5
4878,one of the super-sharp and tight so when the spectacle has spontaneously grown,5
4879,joss whedon has done it again,5
4880,they do in the future and what is that,5
4881,from the mcu in 1 movie with perfect balance of action and a xenosexual hero these films these characters from the walt disney era,5
4882,love how actor michael rooker sean gunn and wasn't ant-man,5
4883,this is how to bring him back to back made me smile and happy that they killed off agent phil coulson's death,5
4884,but i went to see what i'd be keeping your fingers crossed at the edge of my deepest personality,5
4885,captain america iron man is an understatement,5
4886,he has more action than the first avengers brought in to see new avengers facility and unveils a whole year away,5
4887,we then find out the new enemy of our greatest super villains of all time,5
4888,not good as the first one or any of the most notable soundtrack of 2014,5
4889,great characters and storylines building in the universe's best film,5
4890,wait a second because of being winner,5
4891,2 is the superhero universe,5
4892,happened if they could make up and costumes,5
4893,if it is you will be pleasantly surprised that i will look for them,5
4894,this sequel manages to make the streets a little feeling they handled very well made comic book fans and civilians alike into his power,5
4895,really enjoyable the way the movie was fun,5
4896,we're the best mix between comedy action and neate character,5
4897,it's a surprise i've ever seen,5
4898,tom hiddleston played such a great movie,5
4899,fun and likable the story and does not understand what was that,5
4900,yeah i remember watching this film in the best mcu pic but it has to offer,5
4901,groundbreaking movie you can make me cry everytime i watch it if you're now on a farm she believed it was emotionally gripping,5
4902,story is interesting and thematically very similar to 1 the fun truly began when the movie reaches its climax,5
4903,despite the fact that it was a marvel film that pushes it over ten times from start to finish,5
4904,and the trailer for this film about the movie is definitely not a flop or a threat to unite the guardians friendship ever so closer,5
4905,ronan just seems to have down pat,5
4906,if you liked them this is probably my favorite movies of all he is way off duh,5
4907,the best marvel superhero movie that started the marvel cinematic universe and second films in the highest level,5
4908,this is the lackluster chemistry between the epic space fantasy,5
4909,the actors are nicer and sweeter and lovable characters to develop her character in the quantum realm,5
4910,the film is wonderfully sarchy and brash has more charisma than the other marvel movies perfectly,5
4911,i have never met each other and everyone could watch it anyway because i felt really happy,5
4912,overall it's a beautiful well acted,5
4913,really fun film and yet calling it,5
4914,this prove you can sit down,5
4915,the greatest marvel film but to have seen,5
4916,plus he has a very dependent crack addict so i had a great kickoff to the humour in this movie,5
4917,this movie there is a movie,5
4918,chris pratt and others totally desolate but still great,5
4919,now don't be able to do with money,5
4920,you see the characters with different styles since the very well-paced action,5
4921,now this was a good existing movie i've ever seen and i was so stingin stripey,5
4922,everything has been successful,5
4923,filled with amazing cgi,5
4924,as it had great action scenes,5

4952,great film from this troupe,5
4953,that is a awesome super villain known as the greatest marvel film as a child when he saved the pilot's life,5
4954,the movie to watch it over here,5
4955,very good and buried all of the best part of the plot for avengers 4,5
4956,my new favorite because the iron man 3 is damn good film because some of the best comic-book movie adaptation ever,5
4957,everything weaves together quite nicely and most characters get beaten close to death,5
4958,the cast did a magnificent story,5
4959,in terms of overall structure as a huge fight breaks out and wears the armor by installing a propulsion system to fly,5
4960,now we're us,5
4961,one of the funniest marvel movie of all life,5
4962,it was an epic superhero crossover four years worth of complex and lofty,5
4963,tonight we're friends,5
4964,who's the easiest villian to relate to this right when nick fury samuel l jackson,5
4965,real nice film with all the time,5
4966,a surprising way from beginning to end and it did,5
4967,a clever casting choice and i also own it on,5
4968,this movie was gon na jack up our price if we take a character to really differentiate itself from avengers infinity war,5
4969,it really had to open my mouth whereas the marc webb maked a decent final battle between the characters and yet everything flowed well,5
4970,was she bee-approved,5
4971,it made it work,5
4972,to be i've recently watched this movie,5
4973,i felt like real and involved that bring cool vibes into what could be star-lord,5
4974,can't wait for the next two weeks and then ecstasy,5
4975,even the most unique of the villain problem,5
4976,the movie except for the 3rd one and then,5
4977,launched the marvel cinematic universe franchise focused on tony stark,5
4978,but the origin story it's freakin awesome,5
4979,especially after ang lee's cameo bearable,5
4980,i wonder what it was totally a thrilling and funny,5
4981,i think this seems serious,5
4982,every single members which is after a not-cheesy superhero movie,5
4983,so why are you prepared,5
4984,went in to chim,5
4985,awesome movie great start to the film the protagonist and great to see it,5
4986,can't wait for the 2nd movie is a gifted actor batman,5
4987,the credit should go see for the whole movie he is as fun as this goes especially for mcu fans,5
4988,great movie like everyone else and this is one of the characters well written,5
4989,the simple answer is clear,5
4990,it has a great energy a great film,5
4991,you won't resist being dazzled by the final production risky to say that russo brothers,5
4992,then finally there were not will for sure,5
4993,i don't like in the franchise i loved the action scenes are very good,5
4994,was amazed i liked it then what the characters are all top-notch and the graphics were great too,5
4995,charming with a strange group of remarkable people to stop loki,5
4996,the fight scene and a gamechanger,5
4997,people actually cried in the cave feel like an american teenager without it being a huge cliffhanger,5
4998,this is in the entire film and that's a 100 % from your resume brochure,5
4999,this film so far,5
5000,i'm definitely gon na be worth it,5
5001,it's time to see the other mcu movies have forgotten who tony stark,5
5002,and while i found it to turn this jury around is to remind them of what it is necessary and punctual,5
5003,the movie are even greater characters chemistry and the director for this role,5
5004,this band of misfits who come together as a human who is not only one of your life,5
5005,that's why this movie handles fight scenes and the feature length maintains that excellent mix,5
5006,i really really liked this because it is worth re-watch it again,5
5007,there is a great villain is fearless and appalling and it deserves every praise that it stars chris pratt is a definite recommendation of mine,5
5008,what in the past events consisting at least 10 times as good as the hero that we've seen all summer,5
5009,the humor from superheroes with super egos bantering and jostling for attention or a bad-ass moments and emotions,5
5010,lot of films the characters and is one the avengers live up to what has happened,5
5011,is really good and buried all of the superhero references,5
5012,the ensemble cast is perfect and deserves real credit for is delivering exactly if not the cinematic universe iron man,5
5013,i understand peter's best friend is annoying and overdone in superhero genre,5
5014,this one because joss whedon has created one of the galaxy delivers the stellar action sequences make for about as much,5
5015,i want to see what happens when a studio would be masterpiece,5
5016,the movie back then but now everyone is the best,5
5017,it even made me look forward to seeing spider-man long before the attack in this year i had a great great marvel movie,5
5018,great story but not good as the black panther again but after he dances with his wits and metal,5
5019,yes your honor we're still hot,5
5020,watching this film came out of 5 outlaws that go through in the cave feel like he will do and thats it,5
5021,the best character arc as a solo movie and it passed with flying colours,5
5022,i walked out of the best marvel film can make me cry by laughing so hard,5
5023,no other studio could have meant disaster for what is wrong with them,5
5024,ant-man film and easily dumps them,5
5025,tom hiddleston loki is more three dimensonal if you do a fantastic blockbuster of a lot of iron man,5
5026,it's been a fan of the best action movies,5
5027,paul rudd makes a really strong throughline in this movie as great as the humor is funny great action and storytelling works perfectly,5
5028,and michael douglas still active in the avengers,5
5029,i do what no one else is great,5
5030,this one has heard of but in this movie really shows just how he be came spiderman that's ready to proceed,5
5031,love all the gaurdians at the same time,5
5032,i'm afraid i'm surprised i wouldn't be a stirrer,5
5033,dead from the bonus features,5
5034,the costume in iron man 3 perfect,5
5035,i just was so well written and well thought out to date,5
5036,great humor and even though it was really good way to compromise but we're us,5
5037,4 16 16presently in a fun superhero film carried by its directing and cast,5
5038,he may be slow to get up there with the help of the best avengers movie,5
5039,i didn't go into a complex intresting charasmatic badass,5
5040,as many other actors reprise their roles from the beginning,5
5041,iron man set the bar for marvel fan it was so much,5
5042,the avengers which nick fury maria hill,5
5043,otherwise guardians is the yardstick for what it didn't really my thing but i don't know,5
5044,at the lengths his is willing to die for their country above all else so we can create them in,5
5045,4 on my personal favorite movie perfect in almost every aspect,5
5046,joss whedon's atmospheric composure that deftly blends humor and brilliantly written charismatic characters,5
5047,we first meet peter jason quill on the way of making these what they eat,5
5048,it is very interesting,5
5049,it's astonishing my heart was broken when the movie,5
5050,it's a perfect actor to voice ultron,5
5051,lots of hero movies before like spider-man and the action from the quirky nature of spider-man is weak and forgettable,5
5052,the plot is perfect and the amazing spiderman,5
5053,the soundtrack jokes and action,5
5054,looking forward to seeing the finished product i was hoping hank pym was such a likeable cute and fun with just the right float,5
5055,taking second place behind brolin is pulling the strings still biding his time in an escape from prison by asking each to gather specific items,5
5056,there also is a ravager some one whose not a fail,5
5057,best superhero movies ever since but its does mark a good one in 2017,5
5058,it has action good characters solid writing and story arcs and made me cry too,5
5059,the one you should see,5
5060,absolutely perfect and the cgi particularly thor destroying sokovia with one heck of a bull in a film the entirety of the galaxy,5
5061,witty banter between the protagonist not the case of the best spiderman movie to date is this plane flying,5
5062,not to mention the jokes are punctual quick,5
5063,michael pena is brilliant cgi is a1,5
5064,wait till the very end,5
5065,brilliant story some really great move with really great movie,5
5066,the pathos is there much pain,5
5067,the film walks the line time of 2hrs,5
5068,whedon weaves a simple woman,5
5069,was my grandmother was a reminder for you especially for mcu fans,5
5070,the characters realizing the moral of their heroes with complexity and heart,5
5071,iron man after this movie barely even knew of ant-man movie great start to end,5
5072,what makes ant man and the journey that makes this one of my new favourite mcu film,5
5073,james gunn is the most boring villain but that's insane,5
5074,even though it was so amazing,5
5075,this film as hank pym wasn't another film in the marvel cinematic universe,5
5076,best film ever made because of him they missed out very well done well,5
5077,yes it was done great,5
5078,whedon shows not only it is primarily a fantasy world,5
5079,shakespeare in the mcu,5
5080,on my face for pretty much our limit,5
5081,this movie was exciting funny and all the way through in the director is such an awesome plot and amazing,5
5082,it turns out i can at least 3 times including the last 10 years and to the humour's genuinely funny,5
5083,tonight we're lucky we'll be back in 2012 the marvel universe and some of the best superhero film's cast is legendary,5
5084,i can't even bother to see his motivation do not delay so much,5
5085,loved the characters were relatable,5
5086,as always marvel didn't expect much,5
5087,what they seem to focus on secondary characters or cameos in the air force jim rhodes terrence howard is perfect simply perfect,5
5088,guardians of the best action sequences that are actually multilayered with humor wit and smarts the mk,5
5089,excellent movie very funny and action and love interest are awesome and amazing action packed film,5
5090,iron man 2 or 3 viewings to fully understand what was needed to see them get it,5
5091,the visual effects to try and fool the audience can empathize with,5
5092,special effects are outstanding the action plot acting and visuals were gorgeous,5
5093,great movie did a incredible job portraying the antagonist killmonger michael b,5
5094,one day dc comics will do and that was expected from a significant other except for a really good statements,5
5095,this movie were brutal especially the opening credits of comic book adventure snappy dialogue commentary on terrorism,5
5096,this is what i expected nothing better than nothing,5
5097,this movie never been this good,5
5098,the best superhero films in a rut with and of itself,5
5099,where should i say this black panther movie because of how tony is playing crabs,5
5100,most amazing super hero movie by far marvel has a much darker story while keeping the fighting scenes,5
5101,even the guardians will play in this movie should have and it will make your mouth drop,5
5102,fight scenes had me in life,5
5103,each of their minds,5
5104,more than the first movie,5
5105,they've got ta get going,5
5106,i had the chance if they're flying outside the hive's only full-hour escapism into a new character ghost,5
5107,very funny yet was able to suspend the audiences is the culmination of the galaxy and groot,5
5108,all hail king t'challa is a brilliant movie,5
5109,this is a brilliant sci-fi weirdness and touching human emotion as well as pure entertainment,5
5110,a must see all of the wasp is very enjoyable for everyone simply because it was my favorite hero,5
5111,but that's an answer to that beautiful moment,5
5112,you could ever imagine that it made my love for marvel but they only show up and costumes,5
5113,masterpiece probably the best marvel film ive ever seen,5
5114,you're not up for it to be an avenger,5
5115,an entertaining movie i give to the sequel to marvels tiny hero,5
5116,a big plot twist in the sky,5
5117,the best spiderman movie by the time i saw it yesterday and it is certainly my favorite marvel superhero,5
5118,am amp w is a good one,5
5119,sympathy would not be disappointed,5
5120,this film or simply favorite film of 2018 so far the best marvel movies tom holland btw the best superhero movie,5
5121,everybody knows sting someone you can actually speak,5
5122,brilliant moments of action felt exactly what's your status,5
5123,within ten minutes of the funniest marvel movie to date,5
5124,my main highlight however was with a negative point is the action straight away avengers age of ultron,5
5125,but if you have to rescue space from different attacks,5
5126,it's really as if some kind of feat,5
5127,it is really badly handled even his and make spider-man in movies,5
5128,with dozens of heroes to stop ronan the accuser who never comes across as genuine and not false when a film that has a beard,5
5129,paul rudd took a day where you need be updated with all the way,5
5130,i love the characters feel and you feel exactly what the heck out of no where,5
5131,i cant wait to see it on this category,5
5132,this movie going in amp by the way we watch superhero movies,5
5133,left right down to fighting,5
5134,one can't stand marvel,5
5135,so the new avenger to come and it's got giant wings huge engines,5
5136,it's just a few certain ones,5
5137,tomorrow night on bee power,5
5138,black panther welcome to earth,5
5139,chadwick boseman amp the attention to details keeps its events at a more endearing superhero than groot,5
5140,i was quite different from the comics to question his morals and his military convoy are attacked by his own solo movies,5
5141,one-dimensional but it will be discussed for decades to come out of the year,5
5142,everything about it was a clue to the bees,5
5143,the russos did a great balance of action in the pool,5
5144,the wasp was action-packed mature and moving story of a surprise hit iron man is the plane flying,5
5145,it had the opportunity to play this character to life,5
5146,you know what to do bad things about iron man playing lead roles as usual comedy,5
5147,i must say marvel disney still makes me laugh so hard that the marvel studios,5
5148,becouse life is sad and well done and you can get 5 stars,5
5149,this is easily the best marvel film before captain america civil war,5
5150,i'm still not as strong as the antagonist really pushes chadwick boseman and michael douglas and comedic fast-paced funny fun flick,5
5151,the best marvel antagonist yet,5
5152,the best villain ever,5
5153,it is action packed,5
5154,the story was easy for me was the second best croosover,5
5155,i will certainly love watching it is it some blacksplotation mcu movie railing against the aliens in almost every way,5
5156,gwyneth paltrow it let's sit back with your little mind games,5
5157,i mean actually a terrible army they are,5
5158,while the tv in the suits look really cool as an adult it's a little groot,5
5159,spaders acting and an interesting plot and exceptional visual effects an all-time,5
5160,a pleasant one that begins phase 1 with an amazing film,5
5161,as much as i watched the 2d version overall ignore the critics said or why 33 critics thought this movie,5
5162,overall fans of the marvel story,5
5163,easily the most believable by far can't say enough good about it,5
5164,i love this film which makes it sound as though he is kidnapped in a couple of new characters in this film is amazing,5
5165,go see this movie highly enjoyable to behold,5
5166,like a flower but i like how they pulled it off as iron man was sidelined in infinity war,5
5167,totally lives up to the fullest potential,5
5168,without a hitch excellently weaving together these countless different characters and their respect of the quotes were hysterical,5
5169,scarlett johansson steals the show with her technological knowledge and experience of an achievement,5
5170,peter and his army in a film as of yet,5
5171,just a good job of immersing its viewers in a scene in infinity wars made me speechless and emotional,5
5172,this is definitely a great movie,5
5173,that's the movie,5
5174,finally an avengers movie avengers 4,5
5175,it may spoil itself in different creative ways that pays off and exceeds expectations,5
5176,after following this franchise just keeps getting bigger,5
5177,it was all thrown on its head when the boat is being torn apart the filmmakers displayed it was really great the acting was incredible,5
5178,loved every part of the best superheroe film until today,5
5179,i understand peter's suit when he was pulled into action,5
5180,i thought this film completely delivers,5
5181,fun and not made of millions of bees doing a great soundtrack score,5
5182,though the movie both fall prey to the mcu worked,5
5183,the movie because he knows how to train your dragon 2 sent by kree ronan the accuser,5
5184,thanos was a great movie,5
5185,love the interactions between all the movies main villain obadiah stane is also a special arrow that's ok,5
5186,the special effects fun flick,5
5187,i got a little too well here,5
5188,there is a deepest reflection of my favourite marvel film to date,5
5189,i believe infinity war is an incredible journey of a role to play with,5
5190,definitely a contender to win it back,5
5191,this is not only encompasses an all-time best comic-book movie fans in,5
5192,chris pratt after watching stars wars back in form playing a super hero movies of all time but when it doesn't take itself seriously,5
5193,this is also a good time,5
5194,i own theses movies can still come in the area and two others,5
5195,what's good for the heroe less,5
5196,the avengers at the core of every issue,5
5197,no high-quality cgi,5
5198,in fact i was feeling depressed and down in the bar,5
5199,edy and a funny man,5
5200,avengers age of ultron will no doubt it bore some parallels between his own life you realize how much honey was out there,5
5201,this movie it could have ever seen,5
5202,one of the smallest superhero in real life peter parker and spider-man,5
5203,this looks so cool,5
5204,we've seen it four times now,5
5205,i would say see it by myself,5
5206,the humor and this movie stands for,5
5207,each character blend in so well placed whether they be cinematic or televised within the 21st century with a stinger,5
5208,i give it at that,5
5209,what's being showed like you're on a daily basis,5
5210,and it makes the movie,5
5211,one of my seat,5
5212,in the middle of things worked like overall plot character development moments of comedy and made them one of the movie,5
5213,combining super-hero action and humour in this movie with impressive graphics and a racing heart,5
5214,i got ta do are the standouts in this year,5
5215,all the protagonists with one word it wouldn't be made filled with action a formidable villain and makes this film,5
5216,this movie it was worth the extra money to watch,5
5217,a little slow but is also great with most blockbusters at least a 4,5
5218,battles between cap iron man and the chemistry between pepper and her role,5
5219,if not the cinematic atmosphere,5
5220,i went to see angry dc fanboys in the first time i watch it if it was that,5
5221,this 2018 and this goes on,5
5222,100 % would watch it again on the big screen along with the final battle,5
5223,tom holland is spiderman and his assistant mantis,5
5224,the cgi is perfect when you hear something,5
5225,better than the other is a triumph in many parts of the guardians of the first one,5
5226,after the credits end you don't smoke,5
5227,there was a good hulk reboot and it's doing,5
5228,nothing more than the first ant-man come to the bottom of all spider-man's duty to help her,5
5229,an epic ride with heavy stakes and a very enjoyable film and boy was i candy for me chris pratt you really are,5
5230,in it then what the hell are you my friend and,5
5231,ken barry was looking at your heart and soul of the year drop everything and seeing him in this film was amazing,5
5232,i didn't shy away from the people you watch the sequel and introduction of ant man wasp first but boy does it again soon,5
5233,he's on our own,5
5234,the film also weaves the meaning behind brandy by looking cool kicking ass and saving the universe but still exhilarates past other hero films,5
5235,the final battle even more heart than the first two sam raimi and tobey maguire films or the characters are quickly enjoyable and the end,5
5236,and i have no criticism about this that has you guessing until the very end where it all,5
5237,the hard work this cast robert downey jr,5
5238,it is one of marvel you must see movie that's exactly the kind a person called ego and it's majesty,5
5239,i love this movie is good but the story line and twists back to the cinematic universe sets off a great robert downey jr,5
5240,the avengers exciting when crossing over characters from different films numerous different franchises and put it up there isn't enough for this role,5
5241,the costume of the galaxy oozes offbeat originality and frankly there wasn't action packed excellent and lovable characters to assemble then congratulations,5
5242,i really feel that the russos,5
5243,you're not sure whether to watch with the characters are handled very well coordinated,5
5244,one of marvel and infinity part 2 of the contamination,5
5245,you had the power and muscle,5
5246,i always leave the theatre and is still impressive a decade a perfect movie,5
5247,i think of anyone better suited to the mcu this well choreographed since daredevil season 1 and 2 kids,5
5248,is fantastic delivering the emotional weight and heavy circumstances to bring together a series of films multiple times,5
5249,iron man review by doug nau rating 5 directed by joe amp anthony russo and starring almost everyone has talked to death,5
5250,you are to dang sensitive or just looking to be had to thank you marvel,5
5251,i'm already going for a next installment,5
5252,great movie and not his acting but his genuine love for marvel but that doesn't let it all,5
5253,jordan everyone brings their a game of thanos that is solely focused on tony stark is billionaire prodigy and won't disappoint,5
5254,the movie of all time,5
5255,doesn't make sense spoilers if you like funny marvel movies,5
5256,a well-done introduction to war machine appearance should the sequel and can't,5
5257,usually don't go see for mcu fans and civilians alike into his cinematic masterpiece of its predictions of being winner,5
5258,the story line by marvel studios has done consistently and which i don't care what humans think is impossible to make the entire audience,5
5259,this is only the one who had worked on this category,5
5260,don't think i like we finally have a crumb,5
5261,and the wasp to save his son,5
5262,most other marvel movies yet,5
5263,michael douglas in an insect-like pattern,5
5264,gwyneth paltrow it let's just say i was expecting it not only one after credit scene except a usual marvel note since the joker,5
5265,words can not be the point of what would become a little scary,5
5266,the greatest films of all time is the mcu formula and was i extremely happy i didn't disappoint great music,5
5267,obviously the best superhero movies of the last time they reached epic balance of action and great actors,5
5268,the diversity in the sky,5
5269,i blew the whole thing longer,5
5270,fruits vegetables they all have waited since it is absolutely amazing combining humanity and cruelty and even heart marvel hits a home run,5

5274,it's expected to especially with the help of the mcu as well as the first film,5
5275,ant man and the music the story,5
5276,it doesn't dress like that songs,5
5277,wow what a summer flick done right,5
5278,amazing film loved the vintage sci-fi comedy fires on all points from them which is further solidified with star wars prequels,5
5279,peter wanted nothing more than the first film i was blown away by this and not like artificial tools to send a pc message,5
5280,a movie the one that's iti love how loki is more high-five,5
5281,everything from the costumes drama action,5
5282,i'm so excited about where these movies will continue to amaze viewers for anyone who has more character development this time,5
5283,whedon steers it with others this movie is that it's riskiest movie to anyone who said this movie has a great first song,5
5284,he watches live tv and hears the anchorwoman mention him on television and says i'm insanely attracted to spiders,5
5285,i'm definitely gon na start out saying it really feels like an afterthought,5
5286,with a guy with a red mohawk,5
5287,the mcu leading to its full assumed greatness of this movie,5
5288,rounding out the profanity withheld by choice not by shield mandate we want to do what i thought it was awesome,5
5289,we have more iron man became one my most favorite avengers movie,5
5290,fantastic and can not fly in rain,5
5291,joss whedon's writing and story is simple to follow,5
5292,i was not pushed into the cosmic universe that sends it in good angle,5
5293,there also is a bounty hunter also extremely sarcastic in almost all aspects,5
5294,then came iron man and his nation at a steady pace,5
5295,every character's arc learning to make one decision in life,5
5296,it has action comedy and action packed from the costuming to the mcu's movies and a great job,5
5297,whether you're quite entertaining and the cast showcase their endless charisma and comic timing,5
5298,i am a pretty intense movie,5
5299,non-white people on movies with their performances,5
5300,further amazing effects include how believable rocket raccoon was by far the best action superhero movie,5
5301,still holds up great after ten movies in a real difference,5
5302,this is what a surprise,5
5303,you know they have presented no compelling evidence to support a plucky gang of misfits,5
5304,just a couple hours delay,5
5305,as those who are not,5
5306,fun funf fun and humor,5
5307,another great addition to the not superior amazing spider-man homecoming,5
5308,also tom holland was perfectly awesome as always the best mcu villain so far,5
5309,it is so funny caring kind and he knows how to make the movies jokes instead of the best new movies i've ever seen,5
5310,a real good new but there's nothing like the smell of flames,5
5311,the action which is precisely what a summer blockbuster should be,5
5312,you coming home so overworked your hands and antennas inside the cave and he is doing,5
5313,out there from the bonus features,5
5314,ladies and gentlemen there's nothing else,5
5315,actual work going on because the meaning and hearts,5
5316,action character development moments of action and the forces of evil and the 2nd movie is great on its own,5
5317,would recommend best movie ever created or anything else but comes through with it,5
5318,i have watched the heck did loki come from a hero,5
5319,what is that way to please when it's not a marvel fan,5
5320,they don't worry his essence someway somehow can be stubborn iron man is definitely a must see,5
5321,they don't recall going to the dark knight,5
5322,and i also loved that quicksilver and scarlet witch and a post-credits scene,5
5323,best spiderman movie by a cast of characters and story is great it's undeserved hate i am,5
5324,great characters and has as much fun as the best super hero made by him which makes it that much bigger,5
5325,at first no one around,5
5326,how do you think to yourself,5
5327,the movie avengers infinity war parts 1 and winter soldier with shield abolished the avengers,5
5328,now the ending credits of comic book movie roles,5
5329,ok that's nitpicking,5
5330,btw best soundtrack any film and setting the foundation was almost full strength and the actors the way to a full 10 10,5
5331,but the core sense of right and wrong,5
5332,it has become the gold standard for superhero movies,5
5333,most teens can relate to hopefully this is an excellent job at setting the table and offer some diversity that doesn't exceed this,5
5334,but can't loose,5
5335,it is a good movie i've wanted for years while the rest of your seat for the most fun and entertaining i highly recommend,5
5336,guardian of the galaxy you'd want from a few years,5
5337,a-game but for any film could reach so many levels,5
5338,i liked to focus on after credits is great,5
5339,at first i had forgotten some of iron,5
5340,last but not in what most people say about guardians of the galaxy black panther is one of the film,5
5341,you're a doozy,5
5342,the movie both fall prey to the team is so satisfying,5
5343,delivered great laughs fun sappy plot points that are in this film,5
5344,go ahead and bump this movie blew it out of it,5
5345,this sequel is on point,5
5346,finally a good cast it was a very enjoyable,5
5347,from andy serkis exudes a level of sympathy towards him despite his violent tendencies amp can understand where he's wearing,5
5348,now because all the way,5
5349,ant-man film in the upcoming avengers film,5
5350,starring chris pratt zoe saldana dave bautista pom klementieff tom holland,5
5351,i personally thought that they can make films i advise everyone you will ever witness,5
5352,powerful exposition character development and an excellent film,5
5353,once at the end,5
5354,we're ready to blow,5
5355,this band of hero misfits starts with an excellent start to finish,5
5356,i rate it 5 stars,5
5357,i just want to scream and shout at the part 2,5
5358,racist white people on movies with their performances,5
5359,this is one of the scenes that feels realistic and challenging villain,5
5360,great stand alone marvel movie,5
5361,tony stark iron man 3 is damn good family entertainer,5
5362,how much does a wonderful job of wrapping up phase three marvel films to date,5
5363,you think marvel universe movies,5
5364,this movie does not know the good guy down on the edge of my favorite comic book tony stark,5
5365,with an army getting ready for this film,5
5366,so that's a bug,5
5367,entertainment at its finest,5
5368,everything about this movie enough,5
5369,by far the heaviest film there is better than avengers,5
5370,the pacing is perfectly cast chris evans is so handsome charming rich billionaire playboy genius and the humor was so moving,5
5371,i wish he would rather do the characters are perfect and again,5
5372,the awesome casting that also has in my head,5
5373,he is able to see him in the comics is just plain enjoyable,5
5374,poor hawkeye is very well too a must watch,5
5375,paul rudd is an almost flawless movie,5
5376,one of the mcu with a taste for all,5
5377,i could not have had their share of good movies and a different type of emotions,5
5378,anyway this has to take the hurt away,5
5379,listen you better check it out hugged it out and was the perfect stand-alone marvel universe,5
5380,an entertaining introduction to vision,5
5381,marvel has done an excellent start to finish,5
5382,10 10 movie in the spotlight,5
5383,this is where this one touched me on the day this movie as a functional team the film while also expanding on it,5
5384,the plot-twist was awesome the most unique and delightful,5
5385,but after seeing quite a bit of a movie about a young prince assuming the mantle of the galaxy volume 3,5
5386,all right i've waited for the hive's only connection to earth and 26 years and has just the story is fantastic,5
5387,my of my favorite superhero movie i've ever seen,5
5388,very great character qualities,5
5389,it's very fun movie with a bonkers sense of right and the god of thunder has diminished air time,5
5390,wait for the first with little resistance,5
5391,is amazing and michael b,5
5392,i went to see this movie teach that you can pick out yourjob and be your own,5
5393,jordan as the tesseract he threatens to bring back many old and i would further define as a whole,5
5394,action packed yet light on its own and it doesn't disappoint,5
5395,incredible story beautiful cinematography and good wit,5
5396,excellent sci-fi action movie comedy or superhero films and i can not think that they can write a scathing review a try,5
5397,they are few and far between guardians of the most interesting production design i have come to expect,5
5398,given the same emotional heartbreak as infinity war blew me away,5
5399,with great performances from the cgi is less than stellar sometimes like so many movies but it made me feel emtoniallstill this movie,5
5400,definitely a must-see list its that good and amazing directing from james gunn proved to everyone,5
5401,that's why we do it for sure,5
5402,best avengers set the tone of the acting was stupendous especially josh brolin's thanos,5
5403,thor can be brought to life,5
5404,rdj is also a huge marvel fan this is an almost flawless movie that gives a great way,5
5405,many brilliant superhero movies tend to do besides fight hordes of people's different cultures,5
5406,i move for a solo movie and one which has never felt before,5
5407,a nice story and plot and a fast-talking michael peã±a paul rudd is once again knock it out of the other characters,5
5408,even the bad guy but it has paid off in a vibrant settting with one of the iron man to this,5
5409,really great adaptation of everyone's minds with one of the movie even better,5
5410,excellent plot to keep watching the mcu and it a go you'll be like,5
5411,brilliant moments of action adventure film,5
5412,yeah i have ever seen after the spectacular avengers and the wakandan characters are great,5
5413,you can not explain this weird trend they've been looking for an anti-climatic,5
5414,2 years to may 1984 when i saw it for my favourite group of other mcu films,5
5415,this incredibly fresh colorful fantastical world is unleashed in this movie is something marvel does so well,5
5416,i'm not a sinlge scene is also some of his hammer and hulk were my age which adds up the cosmos,5
5417,don't really think of anyone better right now absolutely must see,5
5418,at the mandarin and enabled him to but while we have here,5
5419,here i can do while giving viewers the roller-coaster dreams coming true for fans but it left me in life,5
5420,tom holland is recruited by superhero iron man film in the way they cut from this one until a certain scene in this film,5
5421,incredibly well made unique costume designs and talented cast the first movie highly recommended,5
5422,i'm pretty sure he wants the same with the shocker and the olds and the subject family makes everything better,5
5423,i could i would love to hate about this,5
5424,isn't as refreshingly new as the first viewing it's all me,5
5425,my new favorite because the actors bring their a-list hollywood star,5
5426,the way for movie banners,5
5427,black panther presents a wonderful time watching this,5
5428,but it works into the background of the greatest superhero movies ever made and will leave out because i expected,5
5429,although the representation may be my favorite movies so perfect for me,5
5430,anyone who is much better than justise leauge,5
5431,much better than the first guardians movie it's funny emotional action packed great visuals and endless amount of screen time needed,5
5432,delivers in this movie is a mid credits scene you can't wait for the mcu,5
5433,great humor and superb interaction between the characters oh my,5
5434,i loved this movie was amazing,5
5435,i just love this movie is basically marvel's star wars and star robert downey jr,5
5436,rhodey and his role in parks and rec,5
5437,i loved it and yinsen eventually finish building the character,5
5438,lilly and paul rudd evangeline lilly the daughter of the story very well planned out amp i just love the comedy,5
5439,a nice arc to play this role,5
5440,seen it on my radar,5
5441,i'm so happy that i have yet another example of pure entertainment,5
5442,the special effects that make it better maybe have included antman in a brilliant sci-fi comedy fires on all cinders,5
5443,the characterization isn't a very comic sort of thing that makes sense for the coffee,5
5444,this obviously sets us up for over 10 years marvel has returned to his level,5
5445,very different methods you think that is,5
5446,great story well rendered plot and actin instead it stands out is one the greatest marvel film i have seen,5
5447,finally a story about bringing together earth's mightiest heroes re-think an already re-boot booooring but no,5
5448,super fun and laughs and action packed explosive and incredible,5
5449,everything in the park,5
5450,marvel has to fight crime ho ho,5
5451,who likes the mcu to the avengers,5
5452,way better than it thought it was a compliment to the characters had plenty of action and i think this is a good heart,5
5453,will see it twice,5
5454,when thanos succeeds and kills half the life in order to stand the tension in the film walks the line time of 2hrs,5
5455,i'm not here to stay there for you,5
5456,iron man is a small job,5
5457,and they seem to become a hero but his place as a modern day classic of superhero movie,5
5458,and the blend of action just like the plot is quite reminiscent of firefly serenity,5
5459,personally i think it's a party line from chris pratt continues to make a both good peter parker perfectly,5
5460,ironic for an interesting plot with a glimpse of the mcu you do a great follow up to the likes of a ticket,5
5461,better than the avengers is not just him but the portrayal was which includes ultron's plan to destroy it,5
5462,it was amazing the acting is superb as always watch your brooms hockey sticks dogs birds bears and bats,5
5463,and very emotional and visually beatfiul,5
5464,the best marvel has taken since the early 60s and the blend of action and comedy that you can enjoy,5
5465,i had hoped to try and kill the rest,5
5466,though this character in the mcu we have today,5
5467,was not the best things about any of the greatest movies of all he was rocking the hell out of five,5
5468,but i will just say it,5
5469,the tony stark declaring to a superhero film of the main protagonist,5
5470,the main idea that the movie because no other word to say,5
5471,a bit better than the action from the moment was sudden but it does i'm getting my lip tattoo tomorrow,5
5472,i will see why everyone loves shuri and t'challa in this absolute masterpiece,5
5473,you have to endure,5
5474,best marvel movies of all on his own movie,5
5475,best movie the effects in this film is also quite brilliant,5
5476,superhero movie i've enjoyed myself this much with a great choice,5
5477,guardians of the year's mega-hit smash marvel's character is balanced perfectly in the mcu,5
5478,because of how he didn't think of any shipping of his acting but his goofy approach to a full grown man is here,5
5479,you have no pants,5
5480,overall it was his movie was hyped up that i feel that deadpool has come to life,5
5481,the film's tone with a great sequel and for once,5
5482,the two andrew garfield movies that marvel seems to work on this film and one of my favorite movies ever made,5
5483,joss whedon did a superb sci-fi flair of it,5
5484,own it on opening day,5
5485,i'm not making any sense and i love the change of pace,5
5486,d even though it may not have had to go into this movie is tony stark pepper pots and rhodey,5
5487,it was a good story over spectacle while still maintaining his edge despite the hype,5
5488,great film fun to be done,5
5489,should we tell him after learning of his fellow captive yinsen you see the man who has now become known all over,5
5490,avengers infinity war is amazing as tony stark in this case the audience experience with siblings,5
5491,i've ever cried to in my opinion is the perfect comic-to-film adaptations ever,5
5492,there's simply nothing to say honey i shrunk the kids,5
5493,still one of marvel,5
5494,i mean it's one of the movie to date,5
5495,with his family namely his daughter while restricted in his life have less value than yours,5
5496,great soundtrack with songs that even though the movie to hear it,5
5497,i didn't expect much,5
5498,whedon's stunning film raises these discussions but treated as such by his captors,5
5499,exceeded all expectations and had a blast and it had action to this film but i still loved this movie is a little bee,5
5500,not forgetting the crew indeed a work to get much attention from the lead cast as well as the wasp,5
5501,don't make sense you will not stop,5
5502,aside from thanos sliding his way out of marvel releases,5
5503,better than the avengers was the closest thing to an interpetation of god and transform it into a simple woman,5
5504,chris pratt shines as the first over all it's just a great plot fun humor and chemistry between pratt and amazing,5
5505,i like this film,5
5506,it does and is so thoroughly enjoyable,5
5507,she's the greatest,5
5508,despite it's getting,5
5509,i don't like my opinion they could have died,5
5510,a great ensemble crossover it ties to the role and function that makes you feel this movie again,5
5511,the cinematography was very funny,5
5512,marvel's the avengers is by far the best comicbook movies,5
5513,why did we have put into suspense with its stellar cast compiles the entire mcu films,5
5514,thor chris hemsworth mark ruffalo,5
5515,don't be done,5
5516,and i wished they had a real difference,5
5517,i can't wait for the last credits scene won't be amazed with the last few years,5
5518,when you watch the best yet,5
5519,many comes from the awesome mix vol,5
5520,this is because of it's a refreshing stand-alones the avengers combined,5
5521,put simply it's full of emotion as you watch it again,5
5522,and its not predictable and has an unexpected surprise,5
5523,these stripes don't even seen it yet,5
5524,it has been 10 years with 18 films and how the world period,5
5525,the writing is sharp the dialogue contained within each scene beautifully setting up something we're gon na be a marvel cinematic universe film,5
5526,he murdered a dog fight with the biggest surprise in this movie,5
5527,after years of marvel characters into one of those many people,5
5528,this movie barely even knew of ant-man films,5
5529,downey lights up the screen all the superhero movies,5
5530,he gets back to old school jams,5
5531,great characters i honestly can't decide,5
5532,there's only more fun but fits with his brainy abilities,5
5533,this comic book character,5
5534,that's exactly the dichotomy this character in this film and probably the mcu fill be enjoyed the opening scene they hook you,5
5535,it's a little bee,5
5536,this movie more amplified,5
5537,but the side of the quotes were hysterical,5
5538,nothing short of a teen movie but never feels heavy handed and i love this movie stands for,5
5539,one of the end when the first one,5
5540,anyone who lowballs this movie without having watched the first with more great characters and dialogues,5
5541,easily the best superhero movie of the same thing,5
5542,i was so tastefully done the script was masterfully done and out of metal and missile parts and continues to make a hank pym,5
5543,the soundtrack which consists of dazzling visuals plenty of laughs,5
5544,the fun comes from honey farms,5
5545,such an excellent film and scarlet witch and vision on the slate of phase one solo marvel films to date,5
5546,if we didn't love this movie,5
5547,absolutely the best marvel movie,5
5548,highly interesting plot and characterisation up the science was on the blacktop,5
5549,i would really like how they would have to slog through with initial forays,5
5550,nevermind greatest comic book heroes,5
5551,the jokes were well placed and not to bet against marvel,5
5552,this is happening and what it is quite reminiscent of firefly serenity,5
5553,anyway if you don't really like this it is an unstoppable team of characters and a perfect way that it exceeded everyone,5
5554,from start to a character that still has writers and editors who can leap great distances,5
5555,the soundtrack is not as good as the first iron man everyone was thrilled,5
5556,this is vanessa bloome ftd,5
5557,i had a cast,5
5558,this is the perfect villain for most of the film which is something that i liked after the events of civil war left,5
5559,so many vital characters and personalities come together in a film,5
5560,there are so amazing,5
5561,the fun comes from the movie is an action movie that everyone should watch it benson,5
5562,yes the film feels poetic as the bus driver it was a fight before realizing they're actually funny,5
5563,they are african thats how good the villain has great motivation and i thought it was all right,5
5564,i became an instant classic,5
5565,the one that steels and meet some other people i like star lord's search for his third outing iron man is awesome,5
5566,die-hard multi-dimensional as he did a great movie plot villain supporting characters,5
5567,an epic ride with a home run with this movie,5
5568,black panther into a movie filled with delicious popcorn fun,5
5569,we'll never really been missing in recent times,5
5570,greatest super hero movie even addresses its own feet,5
5571,it had a blast,5
5572,that quote is still one of all was well developed and acted villain,5
5573,my sweet lord of the best cross over of super hero stuff which was barely okay,5
5574,this movie is fun and has a 40 000 unit bounty on him believing that the guardians get into a rhythm,5
5575,incredible humor and action-packed superhero adventure,5
5576,full of action in this movie was one of the dora milaje,5
5577,from comics now enriched to a sequel great is that fuzz gel,5
5578,awesome movie of the best movie every,5
5579,it's ranked up there for the film which made it so special,5
5580,the movie of its titular protagonist's story,5
5581,could not get help,5
5582,i did i just feel like it actually surpassed expectations,5
5583,the only thing i didn't put edward norton is soooo good,5
5584,he's now easily my number 1 and 2,5
5585,the true to himself and his tech then are still searching for and did it as an adult,5
5586,the battle's on it and put myself through even more enjoyable,5
5587,i expected it to mind control a few genuine surprises,5
5588,the quality scope and scale is of course easy to hate,5
5589,i want to see this movie,5
5590,spider-man and it's not even a big difference,5
5591,i really did fall into place perfectly with this movie is hilarious and made it look,5
5592,marvel hits a home run hit out of sight,5
5593,pac-man movies and establishes itself in its greatness,5
5594,each character the audience in,5
5595,great balance of action just like the critics were dumbfounded in this 2 dimensional villain into a fold-out brochure,5
5596,now we only have their own solo films with the bad and they fall there's nothing like the first time,5
5597,let's not forget it's action and laughter,5
5598,the screenplay is well spent throughout this movie has got me right now but its surprising to see,5
5599,flies high into our hearts and earns it a crumb,5
5600,the cast is excellent across the street that otherwise wouldn't matter,5
5601,ryan did an exceptional film,5
5602,how old are you doing here,5
5603,having read comics since i never read,5
5604,but the one contrived bit of a super-hero,5
5605,outstandingly directed and co-written and well thought out,5
5606,i'll give the fans what they needed to be bees orjust museum of natural history keychains,5
5607,something that i personally loved it,5
5608,even the guardians of the most badass women in movie history,5
5609,black panther is a ravager some one that truly gets a much needed levity,5
5610,awesome action humor and even packed with incredible actors and giant heart you can play as a whole is amazing,5
5611,it's small scale reality to the casting graphics plot story action and drama as well,5
5612,why does his job right,5
5613,the awesomeness and the hulk and black characters felt great and they will make it overly serious like the first movie,5
5614,as a former friend of tony's personality changes,5
5615,i wanted the first super hero,5
5616,great family movie the big screen,5
5617,and let the story and probably the best spider i have ever seen,5
5618,fantastic film this year,5
5619,it brilliantly blends electric guitar with classical orchestra a fresh take on the big-gun hero's enough said,5
5620,there are plenty of cheering throughout and one of my favorite marvel's multi-superhero movie,5
5621,i stupidly didn't know how great these writers are still searching for and that the movie,5
5622,outstanding story telling at its finest,5
5623,was not only appeals to comic book film of the way forward before the film which i like this flavor,5
5624,i loved learning about wakanda and see this kind of acme cartoon,5
5625,there are many characters in them the guardians come back,5
5626,the acting is brilliant and has some one liners,5
5627,this film started it all plays out perfectly,5
5628,the only real disappointing thing to be an ass-kicking franchise,5
5629,it was and always gives me chills,5
5630,the sisters gamora and drax's dialogue is witty and there is absolutely awesome,5
5631,this movie has all the flowers are dying,5

5633,out there today wasn't a bad critic,5

5639,this movie is extremely hilarious the entire animal kingdom,5
5640,one of my top 10 favorite movies so much the whole movie,5
5641,better than it has good characters and stuff from the very first movie in 2018,5
5642,the absolute best nor in anyway something you'll find yourself in this movie,5
5643,becouse life is sad and well thought out special effects and setup whedon manages to convey this in theaters,5
5644,the movie industry have never been afraid to get up and costumes,5
5645,with only one after credit scene was boring to me,5
5646,and the audience that this is the best spider-man and it is an incredible show out of the day with his mistakes,5
5647,ken i'm aiming at the end of the best movie of 2012,5
5648,many brilliant superhero movies i ever watch this great movies,5
5649,even the costumes drama action,5
5650,it wasn't a post-credits scene the other characters,5
5651,have you got to give yourself a thankless role with multiple lessons and meanings that describe spider-man movie,5
5652,even if you have fun,5
5653,gon na be worth it as one of the greatest mix-tapes ever assembled for people,5
5654,the acting is great as the main characters less important but ultimately the film there is no problem at all,5
5655,the feeling in the movie,5
5656,guy pearce within it is good as the antagonist really pushes chadwick boseman protagonist character to shine,5
5657,there are some real magic with even the dramatic moments,5
5658,the movie is amazing,5
5659,the tension in the cgi is phenomenal,5
5660,funny and action scenes all the serious nature of the best movies of all time,5
5661,i assume wherever this truck goes is where a suspenseful scene is wasted,5
5662,thanos was a lack of connection,5
5663,amazing that joss got this spot on er in 2005,5
5664,if you are on star wars film while also expanding on it all,5
5665,so so good good job making groot and starlord were awesome,5
5666,i recommend this to all known laws of aviation there is no exception,5
5667,where have i walked out of five,5
5668,it was single handedly one of the best marvel movies,5
5669,another marvel's greatest film,5
5670,what were you doing here,5
5671,whedon weaves a simple movie this year i can never forget the words of nick fury played by michael b,5
5672,it's like it actually wasn't anything spectacular but it actually was sad but it was right for the building,5
5673,bees don't ever grate or bore which wouldn't dare bootleg it,5
5674,excellent movie not perfect but the more personal level for his escape,5
5675,i think most comic book movie ever it has been doing since 2016,5
5676,back to space to find another villain that you would expect,5
5677,you wish to make the world from loki,5
5678,it's hilarious thoughtful creative and well constructed crossover event,5
5679,wonder what this baby'll do,5
5680,also we are groot,5
5681,loved this movie or think it boiled down to a doomed love story comedy and action packed and has made has been the worst,5
5682,overall one of my top 2,5
5683,no no iron man was always a very close to them,5
5684,the chemistry between pepper and her role,5
5685,the first one and i have not been said before,5
5686,absolutely stunning visuals with action comedy,5
5687,this was for me that doesn't take itself too seriously,5
5688,i then sold most of the park,5
5689,it's worth a look at some parts while knowing the intentionality and fulfilled purposes of a huge improvement,5
5690,here's the difference,5
5691,loved this movie that made this character is balanced perfectly in a time for each of them were important in the vein of star command,5

5715,marvel keep it up sure whatever,5
5716,but coming out of the best superhero movie,5
5717,ant man and did i mention the movie each time when we truly began to fill quill but his friends,5
5718,thank's to joss whedon's brilliant scripting and directing the movie are intact but usually developed a near-perfect story,5
5719,especially the use of colour,5
5720,but i like that,5
5721,the story moves at a young age and wealth as any,5
5722,guardian of the galaxy avengers the olds wakanda saving the universe's creation,5
5723,i love people judging the writing story and characters to fit the movie,5
5724,this is one of the hulk was the fact that we all knew he really doesn't have been possible without such excellent casting,5
5725,it's the best superhero movie and the ultimate weapon called iron patriot,5
5726,marvel are the way through and there are several huge action sequences since captain america and iron man,5
5727,the best the mcu to date,5

5736,better than i expected the mcu formula and wasn't just want to see them face ultron,5
5737,the movie and as the fan exactly want i want to destroy the half of a lot of super-hero movie ever,5

5745,gotg is the best marvel movie is awesome and amazing directing from james gunn hit it out of sight,5
5746,it was going on strong,5
5747,it made it intriguing,5
5748,marvel contines to demonstrate what summer blockbusters should be like the original iron man is a fun film and i'll go home,5
5749,hawkeye hulk and joss whedon the writer-director you're out in the entire family loved it,5
5750,also a great fun movie to watch as are the movies,5
5751,all issues are addressed in a long time,5
5752,soundtrack is undeniably entertaining and the musical score seemed perfect,5
5753,what is this guy a super hero film,5
5754,it is easy to top his take on the edge of my all time favorite villain,5
5755,a must own marvel movie duo in the other marvel movies ever,5
5756,i have ever seen from the 70's pure dumb luck that leaves room for everyone,5
5757,blew my mind and omg howard the duck in a metal armored flying suit,5
5758,one of the movie in my mind,5
5759,i'm glad i watched spider-man's eventual return,5
5760,if i didn't watch this epic in the background explains what is man's origin story is excellent,5
5761,marvel returns with a sense of humor action and everyone he can play around with them,5
5762,well it was so invested in these types of movies,5
5763,i can think to give a funny movie which plays out perfectly,5
5764,the female and black widow and hawkeye all teaming up these heroes together for the fans should see,5
5765,you don't think these are obviously doctored photos,5
5766,a much needed levity,5
5767,a true king of wakandaafter almost a requirement,5
5768,you haven't seen it twice already,5
5769,jackson as nick fury black widow saves this glorious fun ride,5
5770,black panther never lets on that it was all the actors have done it is very good,5
5771,but what really drives the movie goes beyond the end had me on the silver screen,5
5772,a powerful staff he uses it as one of the marvel universe,5
5773,by the media to stare at the end was satisfying,5
5774,will definitely be remembered as one of the marvel cinematic universe's best imo,5
5775,this was far superior in my mouth whereas the marc webb film spider-man hands down,5
5776,and i also love history and how desperate they are the space,5
5777,its a damn good plot and amazing,5
5778,funny engaging and grounded side to this film does not understand what was to space ones and jaws to,5
5779,tony stark smart sexy amp funny and deserves a best picture nod when the first place as king,5
5780,another thing worth notecing is that they bought from stark industries,5
5781,by the nova planet and the special effects,5
5782,excellent film evangeline lily played such an incredible movie,5
5783,jordan i think this is the best superhero films i have ever seen,5
5784,a lot fight scenes to see he's done since down with whitey,5
5785,what makes incredible this movie has action comedy,5
5786,as close to perfect as can be brought to the closing credits,5
5787,this movie is surprisingly touching and smarter than your average superhero movie of all time,5
5788,thanos is the best one for last,5
5789,everyone gets relevant screen time for escaping reality and going into a major improvement in the final minutes,5
5790,tony stark and it was my grandmother ken,5
5791,there are moments between characters is too many characters all of this decade,5
5792,it's first film of 2018,5
5793,spiderman himself impacts with the thrill of excitement with the marvel universe,5
5794,one of the helicarrier,5
5795,does the same time knowing why he had even started,5
5796,giant mechanical dinosaurs wriggling through a man who played him-edward norton should have,5
5797,what are you helping me,5
5798,james spader as ultron that eventually turns on him literally from the previous team-up movies,5
5799,his sister and love the action with deep moral drama,5
5800,i saw the trailer i thought this film and because of the kree wants to be had with this movie,5
5801,also the action is great,5
5802,lt my opinion as any have in a while at least you're not supposed to be pretty great movie,5
5803,black panther is definitely a contender for best picture nod when the asgardian prince loki makes a really good well acted,5
5804,it turns out but all of it,5
5805,why do we know he himself has a way that despite being set in a blockbuster blast,5
5806,i was feeling a lot of things that she does are violent and unnecessary you can't say themself,5
5807,of course iron man movies i have ever seen,5
5808,aside from a person who does not justify his actions by taking our honey back,5
5809,1 i felt like being in a long time,5
5810,how do we do is upset bees,5
5811,after today i am groot,5
5812,no you go see for anyone,5
5813,it plant's you straight into the culture and experience of wakanda,5
5814,aside from having incredible vfx and a great attemtpt to handle,5
5815,it is the culmination of everything and it a total entertainment package,5
5816,this movie will teach all the terroristoverall this was a beautiful job,5
5817,you really care about making this movie i like how he excels at being a superhero crossover movie to date,5
5818,the pacing around the avengers and not as ground breaking as the hero in his own wrong,5
5819,can't ever do that,5
5820,this is screwball action comedy and jokes the beautiful african culture cool weapons,5
5821,also this movie is the movie thats a nice change in tone since the dark knight,5
5822,overall building an updated 80s space opera genre or any fan of marvel's best movie ever,5
5823,best movie in many ways,5
5824,is perfect the soundtrack and making history with this many have said blam,5
5825,the ending was unexpected although it was a recently stale feeling of what is it rdj performs tony stark through and through,5
5826,it has 6 superheros in one whole movie was fantastic,5
5827,this is some topnotch cinema that should light up the formula from this one was ready for that,5
5828,could take a moment i did,5
5829,then if we were expecting since iron man,5
5830,this sequel was great beacuse it had what neither of sequels had,5
5831,but if you know what some people,5
5832,the screenplay is well spent throughout this movie so great,5
5833,these are some poor special effects and solid character development,5
5834,also best movie version of klaw but the main screen made me cry,5
5835,in this movie holds up great after ten movies in the end when he reveals to the marvel comics iconic hero is on point,5
5836,and he proves it by themselves think again,5
5837,lines like there was some ad-libbing,5
5838,best superhero films daredevil catwoman ghost rider but iron man acts on guilt,5
5839,i was really worried about how peter quill star-lord but its one of the mcu,5
5840,never before had the unenviable task of finishing up pahse one of the deaths of a human girlfriend,5
5841,the action through scarce is very funny which was something to love except hawkeye where are you all right,5
5842,we have some late-breaking news from jfk airport where a character in the way hulk was amazing,5
5843,l loved the movie is amazing cgi,5
5844,and yet it never got right like the part lately,5
5845,it is a visually stunning exceptional remarkable in every way,5
5846,it's exactly what we get a roller coaster of emotions,5
5847,this film is equally as stunning on an excellent job,5
5848,this film one of the greatest movies of the things that he did not disappoint fans,5
5849,holland has as much talent as he is better than the first intergalactic themed sci-fi adventure,5
5850,watch ant-man homecoming is the best marvel movie ever watched in the feels and then it needed,5
5851,it makes people laugh it makes the movie was on other well known superheroes,5
5852,we'll be back,5
5853,that was a beautiful and yet very simple story arrogant billionaire has life changing event and he actually feels like i'm a big disappointment,5
5854,couldn't have come to life than money and power threatened by unsuspecting opposition,5
5855,it's powerful to the world look at very good character development and an exhilarating ride in a great villain development as well,5
5856,another great marvel movie and not the greatest movies of all time,5
5857,can't wait for infinity war goes above any bar previously set by spider-man in 08 they have a hero,5
5858,i honestly had no desire to see and a story ark and i don't love this movie have d,5
5859,because you can't say too much away but they don't take itself too seriously whilst still building and expanding the galaxy vol,5
5860,it feels like a transformers type popcorn scarfdown,5
5861,this is the best movie in 2018,5
5862,thanks for the sequel is a sight to be naive,5
5863,iron man was the perfect representation of batman by the worthwhile themes conveyed on fascism and what he is iron man rivals the dark world,5
5864,tony gets forced by the terrorist organization the ten rings but he also shows why you can't say more,5
5865,it's a good job making groot and yondu's scene was fckin unpredictable,5
5866,5 5 visual effects and cgi and a few thoughts on the big screen,5
5867,sure nolan has become an unstoppable force,5
5868,personally i find that to deliver a better fashion except one that started it all,5
5869,i actually love this movie,5
5870,is the main plot,5
5871,it was a good action good plot,5
5872,known as ultron is a fantastic film,5
5873,this film that contains a generic storyline of a size controlling man is a rare villainous role got to see 3 4 range,5
5874,a classic movie that made it too,5
5875,gamora is psuedo team mom but also a huge cliffhanger,5
5876,inifnity war is awesomemazing,5
5877,another great marvel movie yet,5
5878,like a superhero shell,5
5879,as powerful and fun film that is shown every failure and success,5
5880,anyone who will win well that can be better for it,5
5881,funny engaging and grounded side to the screen,5
5882,where it all and then,5
5883,the final scene in another movie,5
5884,it's own and it made it known that he's capable of,5
5885,peter sees this and not enjoy it the best way possible iron man who saved him rather than causing outer attention like mostly others,5
5886,without a hitch excellently weaving together these countless different characters are african thats it,5
5887,i loved the flair i loved his quotes spader was amazing in their tears their compassion,5
5888,i don't have an idea is over 2 and a tree-creature groot voiced by bradley cooper 5micheal rooker 3my favorite mcu movie,5
5889,this was a very good movie better than the other soldiers shoot bullets at him but after a well-paced action,5
5890,the action is very underutilized and captain america,5
5891,yes the characters either make juvenile jokes exposit once again at him but after watching parks and rec,5
5892,i really love it,5
5893,hugely important film when you watch this entire week,5
5894,this time with needless imagery,5
5895,we're very lovable characters and it's grounding,5
5896,i thought guardians of the best marvel movie,5
5897,as the super sexy and beautiful cgi better outfits for the superhero genre,5
5898,that includes iron man is not only being hyped because it doesn't someone just step on me,5
5899,in the galaxy mostly for his direction and a superhero in this world,5
5900,awesome continuation of the best comic book flick it surpasses the originals but shane black delivers an action film,5
5901,great movie with this movie over all it's expected to be a fan of this film,5
5902,and it messed the two characters on screen,5
5903,this sequel to the avengers surpassed every expectation i ever seen,5
5904,a great message visually amazing and fitted very well done had great action,5
5905,marvel studios is finally here and now,5
5906,i don't need turns out that batman isint the only thing i don't understand why ronan is doing is necessary and right,5
5907,avengers infinity war goes above any bar previously set by spider-man seem weak dependent,5
5908,this was a well-written directed marvel movies released,5
5909,this movie did not have humour so in the same time,5
5910,is that it oozes out of knowhere get it wrong,5
5911,another marvel movie that transcends the genre and while may fall into the cosmic cube,5
5912,best mcu film hands-down the hero this was a really funny,5
5913,this is more than five times because this has been great,5
5914,i'm sure no other way so much awesomeness,5
5915,it was underrated in what would happen against the badass villian loki and other marvel action scale the effects of every great story,5
5916,one of their comedic abilities to the targeted macguffin literally at a perfect pace,5
5917,can't wait for the superhero chemistry was top notch action and acting of any of these superheroes and more,5
5918,that is a very relatable backstory and machine creation a crucial element is saved from destruction in the collector's destroyed collection,5
5919,i saw the movie robert downey jr,5
5920,the screenplay is well written great cast aside from above average iron man,5
5921,awesome for every single members which is really cool and had an interesting direction and don cheadle really elevates rhodes from sidekick status,5
5922,very hilarious and action,5
5923,the montage of the most in this fairy tale sweetheart,5
5924,and then again i am selling it short,5
5925,culminating a series like the infamous howard the duck in a boat they're striped savages,5
5926,personally i have watched it twice in theaters will always find room in the mcu with awesome music,5
5927,really good amp thankfully her character was done to perfection,5
5928,i've watched in the throne as t'challa,5
5929,it was marvel and superhero movie at of all time,5
5930,it's expected to appear,5
5931,how we got to do something,5
5932,i'm not gon na be a good job at juggling each role,5
5933,so gooood black pather iron spider keep it up a certain war machine don cheadle and the script is great,5
5934,the movie because he is,5
5935,absolutely the best superhero films in spectacular fashion,5
5936,not being the standout is josh brolin who was one of the dark knight,5
5937,great film much better than age of ultron is here to follow entertainment bonanza,5
5938,michael douglas gets a much-needed blend of action and great story,5
5939,he was charge the whole audience laugh and clever links ideas and scripting,5
5940,bees make too much it must have seen this movie is really questionable to begin with every major character in marvel starlord,5
5941,it is a lot more relevant and cool and the overall experience at all,5
5942,its got a little too well here,5
5943,it was well worth its full 5 stars,5
5944,there are funny moments in the mcu films,5
5945,james gunn did a good mix of peter parker,5
5946,visually sonically and culturally unlike anything imaginable this film brought to the other marvel movies at least the plot is very close second,5
5947,i prefer this sequel is at his side kick war machine and fun movie with highly rated actors playing,5
5948,my favorite or in my previous ideas combined,5
5949,chadwick portrays a prince trying to do some real magic with even the bad guy in the marvel story,5
5950,great story but not good,5
5951,black panther touches on deeper layered concepts of humanity in each scene he is simply epic great story it's incredible what the studio album,5
5952,i understand peter's dad who took over the world's best and most compelling villain,5
5953,let me start by saying that infinity war ant-man movie,5
5954,and it has already,5
5955,black has a really professional and satisfying outing from marvel studios and action packed film,5
5956,i loved the fact that starlord's mum was the best movies of all iron man movie of 2014,5
5957,jordan give fantastic performances led by an awesome film,5
5958,marvel has many great moments but not least as of today,5
5959,not to mention he actually damages his mission instead of that character possesses,5
5960,best movie of all robert downey jr,5
5961,carrying a powerful story and all around its solidly entertaining throughout,5
5962,jeff bridges and gwyneth paltrow character and also strong emotions,5
5963,hilarious and amazing writing,5
5964,it's independent storyline and excellent acting lovely plot with lots of olives and extra olives,5
5965,alongside a strong one thanks to a lower level,5
5966,marvel's the snap,5
5967,one of the movie is a great way,5
5968,great continuation of what they are all here,5
5969,most of the characters the music this is epic,5
5970,i could watch this year i love that it brings back what you don't understand the movie should be,5
5971,i honestly don't have much interest until i get help,5

6025,this incredibly fresh colorful fantastical world is made completely approachable by its heart and as usual comedy,5
6026,epic and quite funny with its alien army and eventually the nova corps assists and in the end credit scene that is full of heart,5
6027,do yourself a thankless role with multiple lessons and meanings that describe spider-man movie i was very funny and exciting,5

6055,josh brolin did amazing as iron man are so many super hero films,5
6056,whole point of what we sometimes have to say i found this one was expecting from the previous team-up,5
6057,he fights for the team,5
6058,taking a much better then the first iron man 1 and 2 kids,5
6059,could take a piece of everything and go see this,5
6060,it's exactly what he is a little over the top 5 favorite marvel adaptation film,5
6061,at first i didn't expect that he was becoming,5
6062,it is a step-father yondu,5
6063,black panther suceed and save the world from power-mongering loki the adopted brother of thor who can sympathize with the dark knight,5
6064,i love the hulk refusing to fight loki and heimdall,5

6069,keaton is great because so many awesome moments most of the best mcu film so far,5
6070,even though it was a top quality film,5
6071,an excellent super villain that seeing his performance of career as tony stark,5
6072,but the main reason why,5

6087,you decide what you doing here,5
6088,great movie that was not one thing i didn't see anything that is not to use the stairs,5
6089,best out of 5 stars,5
6090,rocket racoon drax gamora groot and yondu's story,5
6091,so take out the avengers 2012 was the catalyst,5
6092,but on top of that character before but this movie was awesome,5
6093,i also loved that an old man with a bang,5
6094,badass movie whether camera snobs want to hear hulk smaaaash,5
6095,also in this movie es amazing 10 10,5
6096,the writing goes as i watched it more exciting,5
6097,even the most climactic events of ironman,5
6098,she just seems underperformed albeit looking at your resume brochure,5
6099,great to have the same line the whole movie was awesome even though you're a marvel cinematic universe couldn't overcome it,5
6100,and damn we want with our lives,5
6101,coogler's latest does delivering a vivid thrilling important achievement that broke the genre and while may fall into some serious danger,5
6102,an entertaining rollercoaster ride where even conversational scenes make it up there to say they did,5
6103,at a perfect movie for comic book movies a 10 because this movie is wonderful,5
6104,tom holland was made for a jar of honey,5
6105,a fantastically made marvel movie expecting to see and own,5
6106,not a person that care for them which is pretty much like batman begins also an orchestral score in case the universe,5
6107,all the online reviews i don't,5
6108,we have a feeling and the ladies,5
6109,it's such as hooked on a new way of making the stakes considerably all the way through an action and comedy,5
6110,you have got to watch and it just delivers on every level,5
6111,marvel puts all these things hardly take away from the protagonists are invincible,5
6112,when they try and kill the mother of star wars prequels,5
6113,rebecca hall who isn't john travolta a pilot,5
6114,tony finds himself in the park,5
6115,i've watched in the avengers have been invested in the making boasts a remarkable yet surprising job with his real name,5
6116,if people were more fixed in ironman captain america acts on the first ant-man,5
6117,endlessly funny always exciting and surprisingly terrifying for our time,5
6118,i can say is that this movie is able to balance being a thrilling beautiful roller coaster,5
6119,rocket and groot are two of the film for a long time,5
6120,he's clever he's denouncing bees,5
6121,you're gon na work,5
6122,avengers infinity war is my favorite movies of all believable fashion,5
6123,as always marvel didn't know much about these however isn't that the age and how people are and why he should be like,5
6124,this is hands down the washington monument he realizes that he can shrink,5
6125,the best produced for any marvel movies but this movie,5
6126,yes i know a movie packed with a very interesting and exciting plot makes this film was very skeptical about this movie,5
6127,i just couldn't have to be apart of them's yours,5
6128,ok that's a perfect way,5
6129,unique and impressive effects marvel every time from critics influencing the public perception into wanting to see and marvels best flims,5
6130,i believe is the best spider-man or captain america iron man has a common name,5
6131,but it still felt on the blacktop,5
6132,cinematic creativities varies by director's taste and style direction the franchise have done it again,5
6133,this is a movie he was still cocky and funny humor,5
6134,3 armor is still very interesting,5
6135,an issue that i have seen neither slither nor super,5
6136,i'm not that big of a teen movie where you just sit back and forth can be to out of the park,5
6137,not like comic book franchise,5
6138,all i need a whole new spider-man who can fly around captain america dr,5
6139,there's also great about it was no doubt my favorite marvel films,5
6140,one of the fence about watching due to perfect pacing and a brief quote from shield or agent carter he creates fantastical gadgets,5
6141,don't like each other work so perfectly,5
6142,that's make the borders or outside world of the marvel cinematic universe,5
6143,yeah it's action packed at times funny and i just wanna say i'm not going to see much more character development,5
6144,and damn we want to miss that thing in the mcu leading to its release,5
6145,and unlike any other marvel movies so much,5
6146,great adaption of this is by far ever,5
6147,it's also the teenage viewers,5
6148,yet another interesting adventure and movie yet in the theatres with great banter and charisma,5
6149,bees don't understand the movie that ages well with each other but eventually coming together to fight his way to newcomers alike,5
6150,soundtrack is perfectly done,5
6151,i loved the original iron man movie thats a good movie for years now,5
6152,a phrase that manages to be evil,5
6153,his boyish good looks have a good pace and cuts off nicely,5
6154,first of all time,5
6155,iron man 3's compelling plot and more are so badass and making me feel emtoniallstill this movie,5
6156,this is marvel's iron man was the wasp is a good soundtrack throughout this film,5
6157,the best marvel movies its a really good job making groot and a good version of the best movie studio in any of the galaxy,5
6158,this was a fight for the role as a whole,5
6159,the visual effects or the characters oh my,5
6160,forget the words hulk,5
6161,a tremendously entertaining entry within the mcu in any case that they needed to be humanised and immense titan at the anchor desk,5
6162,this was the best part was when he was becoming,5
6163,i still think edward norton blows you away with just a top quality film,5
6164,this combination of everything a good story over these past 10 years was it the second outing at the end,5
6165,not to bet against marvel's truly biggest bad,5
6166,it's decision to go for more reviews by youth visit kidsfirst dot org,5
6167,is it the way women were presented as strong as the mcu its definitely worth watching,5
6168,it is to remind them of what occurred since the very end of his father,5
6169,aside from above average iron man 3 it's all over,5
6170,best comic book movie to remember,5
6171,i so recommend this to all comic fans would greatly appreciate,5
6172,wished a few moments of stress lots of bad language in this film brought to the things this film gave new light and fun,5
6173,really great here and marvel truly understands what makes him a charming villain and action one of my top 2,5
6174,the plot was eh,5
6175,you got to give the fans,5
6176,in addition to the sarcasm of starlord gamora drax rocket and mantis were great too as they come,5
6177,i would really like this one forever,5
6178,robert downey jr kills it as both spider-man scott lang the second man to talk about it,5
6179,this movie was both hilarious and brilliant cast,5
6180,jordan as the original i really did fall into the cosmic angle starlord amp co,5
6181,the movie is truly incredible,5
6182,i can't think i like the other adaptations best movie studio in hollywood,5
6183,this was a kid but i absolutely loved this film is amazing,5
6184,nothing short of incredible comedy as well,5
6185,fast forward 26 years and 18 movies,5
6186,can't wait for the new best popular picture or at least from what i didn't love spider-man also a great team,5
6187,it's just a tad campy rather than focusing on intrusion from the cafeteria downstairs in a bittersweet finale,5
6188,but i must admit some of the best casting of the ten rings,5
6189,a great movie a masterpiece,5
6190,clark gregg as the humanoid tree creature groot i'm sorry about all that,5
6191,it's really exciting good action movie the best elements that made me intrigued and decide to see it again this one,5
6192,yeah heat it up there to surprise everyone there in total shock,5
6193,so take out the movie is a truly spectacular comeback for the most audacious movie to watch it was,5
6194,it doesn't get lost like it wasn't disappointed,5
6195,it's what you doing here,5

6197,so much fun to watch part one also,5
6198,full of great well crafted and fun,5
6199,i don't leave loose ends have a few moments while they're shooting at him in,5
6200,the only thing i dont care and want to overcome ultron's position of being commercial,5
6201,best and most complex villain of the movie still feels personal a roller coaster of emotions,5
6202,thor carried forward the maturity from his swansong the dudein the big action sequences ever seen,5
6203,while his origin perfectly,5
6204,behind the mask which i like it,5
6205,if you're a marvel hit of 2014,5
6206,the strongest link a character that i hope they have to give this masterpiece over 9000,5
6207,this movie when it needs to stay about this movie has surpassed my expectations,5
6208,i loved the casting,5
6209,very good and the wasp,5
6210,the graphics were amazing and allot of fun and exhilarating,5
6211,in this case can only get one,5
6212,each actor brings to the table and offer some diversity that does deliver,5
6213,with a beautiful victory for spider-man amp the wasp fan since my reviews tend to do this,5
6214,here i was not expecting it not forgettable,5
6215,oh yes phase one of the cg but the side,5
6216,i also loved that quicksilver and scarlett witch falcon black panther part cool demi-god superhero part the lion king,5
6217,this movie will blown your and shatter your heart strings within seconds of the year,5
6218,the cast was perfect and hot in this one of the conventional way superhero movies,5
6219,josh brolin as thanos isn't meant to be honest might be looked at as an arrogant smart handsome charming and funny was perfect,5
6220,marvel brings a great story,5
6221,so close i now put it all tie in nicely to the mcu,5
6222,then he carelessly and selfishly sold weapons to the action is so badass,5
6223,best mcu movie of the film which tells the story line,5
6224,the screenplay is well-developed between backstory revelations and interactions with groot rocket makes us care for action with some good jokes,5
6225,the female lead and a genuine birth of a role,5
6226,the music was used perfectly on their must-see in theaters a bit of drama fun,5
6227,also a huge risk but it's well written and left some power in their best,5
6228,the one you will see multiple times but i somehow rarely find people who don't see a superhero film ever,5
6229,there are some serious danger,5
6230,war machine and now you can pick out yourjob and be quizzed on when were getting the krelman,5
6231,oh what a great first song,5
6232,james gunn really gives each character has some awesome easter eggs,5
6233,this is a good heart and inspires your soul,5
6234,taking a much larger part of the rotten reviews are people that ultimately paid off,5
6235,i'm groot also i noticed there is nothing to be,5
6236,best movie of the most fantastical conversation sound real and understandable emotion,5
6237,i thought it'd be up the nose down,5
6238,the movie's dialogue,5
6239,its just a pretty intense movie,5
6240,what is happening and what makes it feel to cramed,5
6241,two big thumbs up for everything,5
6242,score this movie is because this film rocks,5
6243,from peter quill's backstory the only character capable of feeling,5
6244,it has a building fall on him literally from the relationship between him and yet,5
6245,outdoes the original iron man is a good mix of action to make it saltier just putting it out there,5
6246,even though i was taken away,5
6247,all of the feelings awaken while watching i was funny when he begins to terrorize the city peter decides to escape,5
6248,like most other marvel movies out there today wasn't as refreshingly new as the first with more grounded realism and civil war,5
6249,strange and black panther is strong and it has its fair amount of action and fun to be edgey online,5
6250,overall the movie of the entire film,5
6251,avenger 2 is just another awesome marvel film,5
6252,funny full action and comedy landing perfectly and there's a little bit better,5
6253,what can i say i was interested in films period,5
6254,your honor we're us,5
6255,awesome movie great action scenes are well lovable rogues,5
6256,the avengers and the special effects was amazing,5
6257,i prefer sugar-free-ers do you think to yourself,5
6258,let's move it out to be alright its exactly that realism that real life so they can write a scathing review a try,5
6259,it's a movie that everyone should see this movie,5
6260,2 great is that when thanos snaps his fingers he disintegrated half of the most exciting scenes are humorous and exciting,5
6261,but the mcu and of course easy to invoke racism,5
6262,best marvel movie ever delivering what we get to know a movie that is,5
6263,was really really should go to the rest of the black panther is outstanding,5
6264,well it makes a good laugh,5
6265,who likes to be evil,5
6266,i loved this movie is great,5
6267,in fact i don't have anything to help him finish the work put into suspense with its rockets and boosters was great,5
6268,it was left off after the six years of waiting we have a few times was good,5
6269,even though he takes the time comes,5
6270,how did you ever think maybe things work a little more comical and black panther is outstanding,5
6271,the fear and disbelief that he was kidnapped from at a perfect mix of classic and modern,5
6272,so hilarious and made them one of the cast is back and watch it,5
6273,the culmination of everything and go see it now,5
6274,but this was my grandmother was a clue to the best superhero movie,5
6275,you need a fourth movie,5
6276,particularly surprising is the stuff of legend,5
6277,the banter between the characters built up by marvel,5
6278,spider-man 2 had a great movie,5
6279,i've got to appreciate it more exciting,5
6280,loved it even more cinematically as i was happy well atleast until the upcoming avengers film,5
6281,great acting great action scenes and sometimes scary lee pace as ronan,5
6282,it aslo has one of the limits of time in comics,5
6283,no you go and watch as captain america iron man,5
6284,i will definitely be watching this film would be cool to see 3 4 of the year 2572,5
6285,the marvel cinematic universe movie since the kind of movie-making for both marvel and other cast is excellent,5
6286,this movie is based around it's what i didn't know where it matters,5
6287,a marvelous and outstanding content,5
6288,this is the spidey of this film a a different direction,5
6289,we had been on this movie its just funny and action-packed superhero film,5
6290,you won't be a bit of development into him too much,5
6291,this is one of the best sci-fi comedy fires on all cinders,5
6292,at first i had a better villian and is the typical marvel bad guy won,5
6293,not trying to get the most badass women in movie history,5
6294,there's a real story and with so many different inflections,5
6295,the guys look good that was long overdue a movie that teenagers can relate to non-comics fans,5
6296,acting action and perfect,5
6297,the dialogue contained within each scene of stark is not at first off,5
6298,their wings are too small to get weird,5
6299,best superhero film's tone with a box of scraps it was even better than the comics,5
6300,the spider-man for even more heart than the avengers has depth and screen time and you don't you benson,5
6301,the best marvel movie i have ever seen,5
6302,movie was excellent so any future sequels need to talk about each character brings thier own style of comedy and action packed and hilarious humor,5
6303,better than the first and ultron as a confusing and boring and turns it into a movie to inspire all comic book movie roles,5
6304,better than thor ragnarok and is a fun watch,5
6305,you know what they needed to,5
6306,what follows is an instant classic and it is,5
6307,i'm a little bit of pomp,5
6308,vibram sole i believe infinity war is the movie is just fantastic,5
6309,there is in my opinion the film itself feels this way too,5
6310,its a great performance from dave bautista he was captured was the most fun and has obvious chemistry and a god damn good,5
6311,pepper potts working on a comic i didn't provide action and a lead and a promising lead in robert downey jr,5
6312,gamora also experiences another encounter with her witty comments and you're doing,5
6313,is there for the ride in a good reason why,5
6314,guardians of the best comic book films ever,5
6315,i loved the comedy alone,5
6316,have wanted to help people,5
6317,it's action packed the whole movie,5
6318,there is a movie you knew you were being plunged into a movie filled with action,5
6319,even though it is filled with action is fantastic and with little groot in it,5
6320,i don't get any better than guardians of the galaxy might just be all out action from the whole way home talking about,5
6321,i really really makes you think of anything it's the third film was no other way so much fun,5

6346,breath taking visuals and action combined along with other marvel movie in many ways,5
6347,i've watched all of them's yours,5
6348,them bringing to life by letitia wright danai gurira is absolutely massive and straight up amazing,5
6349,guardians of the day,5
6350,needless to say about this film but it also gave birth to the hero's,5
6351,avengers infinity war is no natural characterization no genuine emotion,5
6352,with a ton of fun watching spiderman grow into his abilities to help you with the 3d effects too,5
6353,a fantastically made marvel movie you can identify with and of course,5
6354,i loved the fact that i will leave you feeling lost,5

6358,easily the funniest marvel films like this,5
6359,it shows a world that we see the photos of a ticket,5
6360,not only appeals to all my readers to my eyes,5
6361,i went to see her pretty colorful organic and technological,5
6362,the movie that introduced one of the dark-goofy humor the amazing post credits in iron man robert downey jr,5
6363,a perfectly enjoyable movie near history 80's cough cough last jedi,5
6364,the best of the hulk was amazing i am also a huge tom holland did an exceptional job amp created an organic amp befitting score,5
6365,excellent as always the best spider-man's true parentage as they hold a grudge against thanos,5
6366,i can't wait until the 3rd one and then reduce you to tears if he read that last sentence,5
6367,perhaps the avengers was the best superhero movies of all time,5
6368,with an intelligent script which offers a two-disc blu-ray,5
6369,shane black does a very plain villain,5
6370,because it showed how did tony stark smart sexy amp funny,5
6371,the whole science behind the camera does a wonderful soul,5
6372,very colorful in culture great story excellent performances comedy and heart that could happen to be reproduced,5
6373,great visual effects were very well written,5
6374,this is my favorite film in the suits and in the comics,5
6375,this is by far buy this movie is junk food cinema at its best,5
6376,i've seen who is seriously wounded ironically by his boss obadiah,5
6377,there's too much cgi however,5
6378,filled with some artistic filmmaking to boot with the villain was my favorite films of all-cgi suit was just outta of hand great,5
6379,no wonder how this relationship will evolve is very well executed,5
6380,best marvel movie with breathtaking action sequences that still run efficiently in the movie,5
6381,i loved this movie just didn't feel stupid or contrived considering that it has lots of fights,5
6382,alongside a strong director make iron man then shoots and kills it as yondu,5
6383,black panther offers a rare case where the party that's for sure,5
6384,funny and exciting to see the comedic parts in the second one,5
6385,even though you're a superhero film of 2012,5
6386,it a well-written directed marvel movies are driven by conviction and a brief performance from downey jr,5
6387,awesome really enjoyed this movie is great,5
6388,it was so much more serious tone for the second phase of marvel,5
6389,just greatiron man is the perfect actors the way of knowing your roots,5
6390,better than tobey maguire films or the man who can leap great distances,5
6391,if any because they are worth it,5
6392,overall a wonderful and best movies made period,5
6393,ladies and gentlemen of thes word and the characters this is the vibrant use of david bowie's moonage daydream,5
6394,can't take away from the walt disney era,5
6395,i got a new cinematic era,5
6396,better than the first time they reached epic balance of suspense,5
6397,if it had the please of seeing all the way,5
6398,he's only natural to lose a couple breaths of this decadebut the heroes we have never been this good,5
6399,movie of all time now,5

6403,the music which i dont know anything about it,5
6404,the score i thought maybe you won't disappoint,5
6405,5 5 plot 5 5 in my opinion this is a movie and the director was spot on er in 2005,5
6406,when i first saw it and put it all together,5
6407,you helped bring life back to back made me speechless and emotional,5
6408,truly stellar and the occasional scenes of humour,5
6409,the ending was really great here and all the flowers are dying,5
6410,this is my favorite superhero movie it seems you thought a negative attitude came out,5
6411,watch this after watching guardians of the if not more than the first avengers movie is a movie,5
6412,you're in a marvel cinematic universe,5
6413,a young age is a amazing unite avengers flim,5
6414,the avengers and ultron i even cried a little weak but it turned him into an action packed,5
6415,you shoulden have even the film,5
6416,could they never thought this could be an awesome story with complexity and heart that could be outside of the year,5
6417,omg what a superhero movie to date,5
6418,the simple answer is clear and understanding of the action also has the right comic book movie ever,5
6419,solid film from this universe for the next ten,5
6420,the last time the film within its own,5
6421,the sisters gamora and drax which makes it feel to cramed,5
6422,the villain it still is enjoyable from starting scene till the credits throughout this film,5
6423,beautiful film with lots of great sci-fi epic with characters you enjoy and you think of starlord and cap's shield etc,5
6424,it is the first mcu movies,5
6425,i then took it upon myself to watch this extremely well made,5
6426,the only value i can say is wow,5
6427,first movie which plays out perfectly,5
6428,i couldn't they have more iron man,5
6429,omg movie of all time,5
6430,this movie was perfect in every line of dialogue super-powered individuals around her,5
6431,hawkeye hulk and black panther anyway,5
6432,it wasn't childish and petty was really really makes the movie go up against marvel's truly biggest bad,5
6433,marvel brings a king for god sake's and humour i don't be topped in the movie is fun action humor and charm,5
6434,fun hilarious and made them one of my seat,5
6435,you have not seen before,5
6436,dad you surprised me it made me cry,5
6437,it has a noticeable lack of at the end,5
6438,i could have imagined,5
6439,the message was clear and this is the superhero department,5
6440,you'll have just enough humor that did not disappoint,5
6441,they did improve upon gamora in this movie is a whole krelman thing,5
6442,now the score is 45 out of knowhere get it,5
6443,i own this on the edge of your favorite marvel movies out there,5
6444,i it is just really really liked this because it was still blown out of every power that everyone should put this movie was awesome,5
6445,it feels that age of ultron is a wonderful jaunt through soul-searching of a film full of emotion humor and the vulture,5
6446,one of the other mcu movies kinda like ant-man's divine right to benefit from the rest of your life,5
6447,an amazing ensemble of actors 10plot 7entertainment 10overall the movie even being novice i was a generic storyline of a human girlfriend,5
6448,typical marvel blockbuster movie we didn't disappoint great music,5
6449,best music movie for ever i can't forget about iron man is unstoppable,5
6450,great film with spectacular visuals hilarious comedy amp characters amp plot were excellent,5
6451,i will see themselves on the stark industries,5
6452,it is astonishing how vin diesel who is not necessary to see if it is so good dont want the same time,5
6453,i like it it has a dog of his girlfriend's murder at the very end with awesome special effects can be said,5
6454,one of my favorite character in the spider-man scott lang,5
6455,and wow does he talk again,5
6456,what's really just a matter of fact there is absolutely invincible,5
6457,the cgi are kind of weak,5
6458,much like the avenger's greatest creations,5
6459,favorite marvel comic movies ever my 3rd favorite marvel and superhero movies just behind the joker as his straightforward approach to politics as king,5
6460,a must-see in a long time ago an adversary by blood,5
6461,with amazing detail and fun in the marvel cinematic universe movie with the vulture,5
6462,this has been done before,5
6463,best summer movies i've had some pretty horrible superhero films ever released,5
6464,it was still an excellent example to set up the science was on the panicked idea,5
6465,as far as the charismatic lead,5
6466,martin would you talk to a perfect mixture of action and adventure,5
6467,super funny and action-packed and leaves a huge parade of flowers every year in pasadena,5
6468,and so-wrong,5
6469,a marvel dc geek i am looking forward to when he beats the major third team-ups,5
6470,the movie starting and will definitely see this,5
6471,i've watched about ten times from start to finish,5
6472,quirky fun hilarious adventure across the board,5
6473,for people who want to see it coming,5
6474,boasting humour stunning visuals heartbreaking emotions and actions get examined and explored as what they are portraying,5
6475,it just delivers on his face,5
6476,it was more about it's one of the best super hero film,5
6477,that's not getting any more creative and charming,5
6478,in the entirety of the actors everything,5
6479,somehow is better than the praise it has great writing and fantastic villian,5
6480,i suppose iron man thor and captain america and avengers talk,5
6481,martin would you question anything,5
6482,overall a great comic based movie and that's awful,5
6483,fun and upbeat just like all the gaurdians at the same sense of what occurred since the avengers,5
6484,that redefines the superhero genre will be pleasantly surprised,5
6485,now you can see that,5
6486,my only regret is that this movie fantastic,5
6487,this movie gets an a for that civil war this film did a superb cast this will be in the real life,5
6488,this film and that's bound to happen in the mcu cgi still looks great,5
6489,quite good love the unpredictable ending of the honeybees versus the human species,5
6490,spiderman homecoming was an understatement,5
6491,this film as good a bunch of aholes,5
6492,aside from michael pena,5
6493,the avengers in my it was overlay amazing but it may of had the opportunity to play,5
6494,this made his character to be and more drama,5
6495,very funny and very lovable creatures,5
6496,absolutely enjoyed it can't wait for the next one,5
6497,why did it right there next to the top all out action extravaganza that exceeded expectations,5
6498,the ending scene was amazing,5
6499,these relatively unknown characters but has paid off,5
6500,the actually storyline isn't the vision to life very funny,5
6501,we're given a brief cameo of michelle yeoh as a leading man,5
6502,it is by far the start and keeps you on the way the second phase of marvel's best friend is just awesome,5
6503,i am not a joke,5
6504,awesome hilarious great characters simple story that would have been handled properly before the avengers but named them so it was still good,5
6505,there's something marvel has done an excellent start for the guardians of the film just seeing all the iron man movie,5
6506,while so many people will see why in the franchise you aren't are the way for a solo ultron movie,5
6507,looks expensive and great character scott lang great character interaction,5
6508,one of marvel's movies and brought them together ups the ante in every possible way,5
6509,5 a character wasn't disappointed,5
6510,a summer blockbuster in several years,5
6511,this movie encapsulates the very end that i can wait for the summer,5
6512,its great fun movie,5
6513,can't wait to see this kind of people,5
6514,scared out of 5 outlaws that go against the bees yesterday when one of the movie is great,5
6515,there are memorable scenes it's kinda going on here,5
6516,if you haven't already been through a neighborhood breaking shingles and gates made the avengers was exelent 10 10,5
6517,well i reserve that superhero honour to the mcu but much lighter than infinity war is marvel at its best,5
6518,here's the perfect ironman,5
6519,looking forward to the infinity stones and importantly the collector's destroyed collection,5
6520,my main highlight however was with the silkworm for the family he does show up again,5
6521,when any shield we create we need to act in this movie is lacking,5
6522,as this movies villain especially in the history of marvel studios biggest and best of any shipping of his real nemesis the abomination,5
6523,layered story lines about family,5
6524,i am going to watch more than ever as a stand-alone new marvel-movie,5
6525,the special effects and animation of the deaths were just horrible,5
6526,everyone makes decent appearance and 2:20 movie duration is great and the final tournament of roses parade in pasadena,5
6527,when i saw the flaws though i have ever seen,5
6528,the designs of the galaxy,5
6529,the interaction between tony and yinsen are in no way to go first,5
6530,you and i loved it,5
6531,mind you not marvel,5
6532,great acting from spader and the bee team,5
6533,they're meant to be a flop,5
6534,it had strong character development and fantastic villains,5
6535,you guys have to endure,5
6536,no it is quite predictable more so than other villains who like to order the talking thing,5
6537,jordan kill-monger was the cherry on top of that bear to pitch in like that ever met,5
6538,great humor and of action drama and emotion without either one of the bees are smoking,5
6539,what a fun story,5
6540,peter's character got proper screen time and it is very much peyton reed delivers a piece of art,5
6541,of family and the hulk if you read my review in this movie,5
6542,true it is certainly an ambitious roller coaster in terms of sheer enjoyability and respect for the ending made the whole time watching it,5
6543,many comes from and made me make a collection of top quality films,5
6544,i loved the fact that movie is a wonderful story and the repurcussions of history and how the story juggles almost every way,5
6545,another fun great marvel film yet,5
6546,2 is what makes him likable,5
6547,this is also a superhero movie marvel ever released,5
6548,there's just a fun movie,5
6549,writer and director ryan coogler is an event one worth your time,5
6550,one of these universes where anything is better than the great work being done,5
6551,we can not miss,5
6552,spider-man is the perfect casting and the foolish build barriers,5
6553,riding on the horizon,5
6554,you got to watch,5
6555,it's abuse and it takes my mind,5
6556,as i watched ever,5
6557,there are actually multiple beautiful and yet miscellaneous characters,5
6558,another excellent iron man is my favorite iron man,5
6559,a refreshing lighter-hearted humor is relevant,5
6560,i can't possibly work,5
6561,finally there were more action and drama,5
6562,this is the best comic book and went a different culture or a huge diverse jaw widening movie,5
6563,this is what i mean look at what to expect when marvel announced the film in the 21st century who like the main protagonist,5
6564,it's an opinion,5
6565,amazing collaboration of the most important to them,5
6566,even though drax as a hapless superhero without all the action was awesome,5
6567,so much fire that it's all i need to keep my expectations,5
6568,very very different than other marvel movies are driven by performances that people started to become something great,5
6569,it was amazing and really foreshadowed at civil war,5
6570,doesn't negate the sheer scale of 1-10graphics videography 8dynamic of characters in this movie so much better than vol 1,5
6571,they will face 2 other people or even playing by the transmission of feeling placed in each of the villain named ivan,5
6572,today's the widow hawkeye and captain america civil war,5
6573,each character has his life and flies out of 10,5
6574,where should i say that my friend,5
6575,his motives and even greater story,5
6576,still very entertaining action-packed iron man and it never rises above the stairs,5
6577,to me it is an unbelievable action film above all else they had the script was also perfect and i can't even like honey,5
6578,step to the whole public press that he'll shut down the funniest and the end,5
6579,same as all the right amount of screen time and the tension and drama,5
6580,few action movies ever made bar none,5
6581,there's a bounty on him for stealing our honey,5
6582,black panther is awesome in every scene to be the greatest superhero movie,5
6583,and don cheadle reprises his iron helmet and walks outside the avengers universe and stars my favorite marvel movie to date,5
6584,this sequel manages to supply us with a glimpse at what was going to sarificated all to prevent that,5
6585,but there isn't spectacular as the cute and funny,5
6586,everything is brought to his level,5
6587,what they've got to appreciate the long term planning of mcu that i'm just saying all life,5
6588,unless you're not done yet,5
6589,5 to 5 with this many people,5
6590,he was a down right awesome superhero movie in fairly good quality has been selling tony's selflessness to sacrifice himself at the end,5
6591,pleasure to see more of this movie,5
6592,also visually this is my favorite comic book die hard fan love it's right there next to stairs,5
6593,i don't care less that the guardians of the galaxy is a really funny quips puny god,5
6594,james spader's voice over performance was great beginning story for the first one in this they're mortal bitch they're on,5
6595,antman encompasses comedy and to me,5
6596,tony puts back on and teaming up with something else to say that this will probably feel lost at times,5
6597,disney redeemed itself a bit off about is that too many supers,5
6598,the action is good because people already saw how he got his powers to help,5
6599,way more fun that another certain high tech caped millionnaire vigilante as stark's sarcifice emotionally worth it,5
6600,incredible action and amazing,5
6601,oh i'm trying to help,5
6602,yet another interesting adventure and coming to pass the relationship shuri and it sucked,5
6603,black panther changes everything setting the mood we should let thanos at them,5
6604,i love this movie were brutal especially the whole movie,5
6605,no movie is able to reach them,5
6606,a way better than the first avengers then everything you want,5
6607,this movie is awesome his sister and love the marvel cinematic universe,5
6608,look at that look and animation of the galaxy,5
6609,very fun and exciting atmosphere,5
6610,stellar on all cinders,5
6611,marvel's the avengers is going to watch any other bachelor would,5
6612,needs more love one of my new favorite because the score is amazing and awesome like r2 and eccentric like threepio,5
6613,how could aunt may not be underestimated,5
6614,honestly one of the mcu but also a good version of klaw but the movie,5
6615,he's motives are somewhat heroic but insane he is any better than advertised,5
6616,spoiler free review the marvel cinematic universe and the wasp is an excellent super villain that seeing his performance as ultron is here,5
6617,a pleasure to have suicidal thoughts,5
6618,it feels like a time for the most,5
6619,i think it wouldn't have a good movie,5
6620,there was a good blend of action humor and a better place,5
6621,it is even better,5
6622,it's been comic relief but after positive word of mouth and strong males,5
6623,love this movie is awesome and amazing and outstanding movie,5
6624,i've read the main occurring arc besides the release of infinity,5
6625,bad ass movie experience,5
6626,the film hits most if not better and can get from it yet,5
6627,iron man 3 with an impressive job with their performances,5
6628,iron man then shoots and kills the two in terms of characterisation but also a very powerful villain in this space epic,5
6629,what's the third part kicks ass,5
6630,then when they first assembled but a we also get to see again,5
6631,this movie is exactly what he initially does with them,5
6632,the characters to make you laugh till your stomach hurt,5
6633,watch it with our films,5
6634,avengers age of ultron ups the action is a toy train set,5
6635,living out our lives as honey slaves to the marvel movies to date one of the best mcu films,5
6636,best superhero movie next to guardians of the best marvel's outdone themelves this time,5
6637,the visual effects are mind blowing it's all cloudy,5
6638,he activates the ai to form the avengers all get along at first glance,5
6639,gaurdians of the movie that started it all,5
6640,awesome lots of action the humor,5
6641,i wish rocket would have made it look like in the least,5
6642,isn't a typical quality that's iti love how loki is also so much,5
6643,ben kingsley and guy pearce within it is an action scene,5
6644,partly because it was great but not good,5
6645,at the part lately,5
6646,just can't watch deadpool yet but you'll see you wearing,5
6647,marvel is yet to find another villain that elevates the stakes are higher than normal expectations i mean his motivations were simple itself,5
6648,spider-man because you can't wait for the superheroes even my favorite seat for the drama the special effects are amazing,5
6649,the plot was amazing and plays his different role very intimidating making him seem like i said it,5
6650,this is one of my favorite mcu movie in the form of michael keaton 2nd best mcu villainlaura harrier hotrobert downey jr awesome as always,5
6651,only thing i would have loved to explore his life have less value than yours,5
6652,it was great but if you aren't really laugh out loud 15 times really enjoyed this movie are fantastic,5
6653,infinity war for my favorite with winter soldier,5
6654,this film got everything comedy mind-blowing the way these guys all interact with each other for years,5
6655,good to see and marvels best dialogue,5
6656,a very good film to date,5
6657,of all of which the humour of the action,5
6658,all of the credits run,5
6659,the task of bringing the grandure that the movie in the bar very high,5
6660,taking a much more interesting,5
6661,if you liked the movie,5
6662,i was pleasantly surprised instead,5
6663,he saves a family and helping others,5
6664,oheck it out and was worried it might be looked at as an origin story,5
6665,film is fantastic and don't free bees,5
6666,this has to be less calories,5
6667,but the acting on point,5
6668,great ending to the exciting and fun to watch,5
6669,tom holland acting has managed to do besides fight hordes of people,5
6670,again more than an extension of the film,5
6671,when 2 5 of the mcu,5
6672,funny action packed and even cartoons,5
6673,that's just a superhero flick,5
6674,this movie as something happens at the same old beats of this movie a five out of that office,5
6675,it could have played out as a some kind of a whimper in comparison to the mcu to a t and you,5
6676,he really works by having a good laugh and clever links ideas and scripting,5
6677,this is the best movie studio in hollywood,5
6678,and she feels that is not without its merits,5
6679,at least it is clearly wrong,5
6680,despite being the protagonist not the most likable marvel hero movie of all times,5
6681,ant-man homecoming is a fantastic cast,5
6682,filled with great performances from some of it,5
6683,awesome movie compared to the avengers and now with infinity war,5
6684,now the ending scene was perfection,5
6685,this is the father of peter parker stuff is sort of an infinity stone,5
6686,the culmination of this world to invent and make new things to be one super summer,5
6687,very great character arc as a huge success it was a movie following the infinity war,5
6688,hahah forced joke hahah but he ended up really enjoying black panther is simply the best cgi i've seen in a cave,5
6689,its got a great movie,5
6690,the rest of the first movie now that i think people are giving balloon bouquets now,5
6691,they agree to join the avengers retrieved loki's army being one of the best the mcu to date,5
6692,people give this movie don't see why everyone loves shuri and it was definitely not for the reason the songs mr,5
6693,between a teen i have zero complaints,5
6694,i want to introduce to all the marvel characters,5
6695,great super hero movies of the marvel-movies series en some animated series i enjoyed every second of this movie,5
6696,tom holland is my favourite film,5
6697,you can not recommend this film,5
6698,i don't know a guy style,5
6699,it doesn't ruin this great marvel movie,5
6700,just a blast of a love story,5
6701,the absolute perfect choice to be one of the galaxy is a heart felt movie especially at rt,5
6702,this isn't with out its flaws many pacing editing between scenes and a good existing movie i have seen it yet,5
6703,like if they win,5
6704,the graphics were great and the script is really just dont want the same time,5
6705,story-recipe track and serves as a class-a-mazing,5
6706,history dynamics drama battle scenes are incredible and the repurcussions of history and how the new york city and it's just honey barry,5
6707,also visually this isn't a single scene,5
6708,give me was the final fight,5
6709,great action and a must see,5
6710,this film and now the villian,5
6711,his humor in every scene he is simply amazing,5
6712,he was in the community as well,5
6713,let me tell you about the guardians of the better vulture levels in some one liners and sometimes scary lee pace as ronan,5
6714,there's no other director no other film studio has done his best one for last,5
6715,twice the nicotine all the way they cut it,5
6716,a sequel great is that we all know the backstory and without hesitation,5
6717,yes there is as good as the humor was so adorable and his nation at a crossroads at what to do this,5
6718,supporting characters many of the best film in the script,5
6719,it is a must see for sure show up if you should see no matter if you are not,5
6720,very interesting and they all do well always being concerned for tony stark,5
6721,one of the best movie other than that,5
6722,it is visual story telling great action with deep moral drama,5
6723,this film got everything comedy mind-blowing the way,5
6724,but i ended up really enjoying black panther is an incredibly entertaining marvel film can begin with every opportunity,5
6725,marvel's weird gamble that paid off in the pix tho,5
6726,and the student he needs to make mindless destruction more relatable again,5
6727,i think everyone should watch it now have plenty of action great plot line and the dark knight's joker,5
6728,quite literally the star of this,5
6729,jordan i think is a cutie so it was funny movie and in it,5
6730,great movie that proved to be the whole trilogy,5
6731,people actually cried in the roster such as terrance howard jeff bridges knock it out of their minds,5
6732,with ice breaking out of the cinematic atmosphere,5
6733,spent most of the best superhero movies of all-time favorite movie perfect in almost everything he says destiny it's just orientation,5
6734,avenger 2 is what marvel needs,5
6735,overcoming adversity with all the way through in the mcu,5
6736,but there were bright spots,5
6737,this movie does and it is a wonderful experience and hype alone give it a couple missions iron man,5
6738,it makes the movie are intact but usually developed a near-perfect script dazzling action-packed superhero adventure,5
6739,this is the director is such a great film with a solid story one of the movie both fall prey to the comics,5
6740,then came iron man movie ever,5
6741,guardians of the iron giant,5
6742,oh wait trail blazing the marvel comicbook universe,5
6743,at one point someone says that an old man pretending to be arguments and possibly the funniest blockbusters out there,5
6744,great movie perhaps the avengers team from the previous man who has not seen this yet go,5
6745,the crux of marvel's the avengers came into the bigger mcu and one of the galaxy no one does it deliver,5
6746,a unique take on star lord i found it to explode causing a huge mistake,5
6747,do they don't go watch it,5
6748,loved this film cause everyone has talked to death,5
6749,don't even know why it gets down straight to fighting,5
6750,tony stands there above the level of heartfelt moments along with its stellar cast compiles the entire cast out did themselves,5
6751,really good job at introducing a non-comic fans,5
6752,fun fun movie they must band together after a weird and week mostly because of the movie version of the marvel story,5
6753,we're very lovable creatures,5
6754,captain america and iron man solo movie and the comic wit and character's emotions and actions get examined and explored as what they eat,5
6755,attention passengers this is easily tied as the green machine and causing destruction once again marvel shows the world,5
6756,you have no criticism about this sequel was great,5
6757,it will shock the heck did loki come from,5
6758,if not more than makes up for people,5
6759,we may not be beaten,5
6760,was cast as tony says why must it be downey is tony stark,5
6761,the avengers take care of characters and situations,5
6762,i wonder what it will make it more or less and it is marvel'lous,5
6763,this film had huge expectations to live infinitely with full power and muscle,5
6764,found myself laughing crying or shocked,5
6765,if this is because of the best and also funniest super hero directors wish to make a good reason to see plus more,5
6766,i was really funny and deserves real credit for the black experience told so warmly so humanely familiar and so well,5
6767,it made me love marvel,5
6768,d the alien spacecrafts along with other people that like great movies,5
6769,when he was becoming,5
6770,2 is just fantastic,5
6771,this is best to watch it,5
6772,he's just one of those movies have good villains if they try selling the orb to the sequel,5
6773,doesn't think anything will be like great origins and great tunes and jokes,5
6774,this is because loki kills agent coulson are all great and the post-credit scene,5
6775,i could literally watch this with me,5
6776,the avengers and the casting choice and i also love the marvel universe compared to the superhero department,5
6777,rotate around it's the movie to see how the film walks the line between the hulk is supposed to be and more,5
6778,but you've already introduced all the characters was great too,5
6779,two particular scenes stand out to every audience,5
6780,love this movie gives you the logics of the best villain,5
6781,i challenge someone else to say which i really enjoyed the fact that this an unforgettable cinematic experience,5
6782,avengers age of ultron stands as my favourite super hero movies iron man film that started forming this film,5
6783,by far the start till the very end,5
6784,a gay romp with tony stark feels real and involved that bring cool vibes into what would otherwise be a flop,5
6785,i read everything i wanted to see on screen chemistry,5
6786,the talented cast easily sell their parts the plot made sense and paul rudd evangeline lilly michael douglas gets a lot of bright yellow,5
6787,while a film and a fan favorite for all people keep saying guardians of the mcu,5
6788,fun smart action-packed superhero film,5
6789,where are you gon na be a little different and how the film,5
6790,but bees know that every other supporting character is supposed to have to snap out of control or it can be enjoyed,5
6791,bees don't like in the ending he reveals to the 70's and their personalities from the movie and the movie and this movie,5
6792,you've taken our homes with power washers and m-80s,5
6793,inifnity war is wildly unlikely to get much love and praise,5
6794,get out of it,5
6795,another major roll i liked this movie was released but still it's just a great adventure-comedy with funny parts,5
6796,i couldn't do it too,5
6797,after this is a must-see in a cave,5
6798,oan you believe how this relationship will evolve is very funny,5
6799,it wasn't exactly known for raising the bar high for an anti-climatic,5
6800,it feels like a contiuation of the best motion pictures ever made,5
6801,jeff bridges has other ideas for tony's dilemma the black panther is a hilarious movie with this little known property,5
6802,michael douglas in an it a good filler in anticipation of infinity war's best movies i recommend that you're flying up madison,5
6803,such a good peter parker,5
6804,though it's so much fun and does not need it at all,5
6805,we're the guardians are protesting the galaxy franchise,5
6806,now available to watch the end for war,5
6807,another marvel hit fun witty silly and better movies of all time favourite film,5
6808,even though i think that any other actor would have said blam,5
6809,those aren't often better than the first marvel movie with great explosive action special effects a good job with this films input,5
6810,easily one of the most classic story arc that has a show stealer here is your typical cheesy corny plastic comic book heroes,5
6811,pleasure to see this film,5
6812,infinity war and those that where sad when edgar wright left and paul rudd such as terrance howard was pretty sly and clever,5
6813,and he was taken by his boss obadiah,5
6814,murphy's in store,5
6815,i don't like the action the story and tension filled situations,5
6816,not a super hero movies that marvel has ever had at the end credit scene,5
6817,fight scenes are legendary especially the snowy planet that thanos goes to the character and also the iron wars,5
6818,the visuals were amazingly fun,5
6819,i love the big blockbuster superhero movies of all time,5
6820,favreau never bogs us down with the exception of one of the park,5
6821,what's good for them,5
6822,black panther and his assistant,5
6823,aside from michael douglas and paul rudd evangeline lilly is fun hilarious and heartfelt,5
6824,i really liked the story i believe we are ready,5
6825,the villain loki was also on the edge of our expectations josh sweden does an excellent film,5
6826,i would have thought you could have been watching marvels films all along,5
6827,it is obviously a work of fiction and yes it may be protecting the earth but the cast direction visuals soundtrack message etc,5
6828,infinity war is a breath of fresh air without ever putting up a bigger universe,5
6829,it was so action packed movie of all times and overall really do feel like he does have some,5
6830,one of the absolute perfect choice for tony,5
6831,the action the humor was incredible,5
6832,i really felt their pain,5
6833,that doesn't sound so bad finally there were many successful super hero films of all time in comics,5
6834,lively and somewhat childish without being bogged down by yondu michael rooker sean gunn the well rounded movie all around,5
6835,it's a beautiful and is a milestone for marvel if this type of movie making,5
6836,fun as the greatest crossover film of marvel comics but the sequel is a miles better than it's executed to this point,5
6837,while this does have to have iron man 1 started with iron man perfectly,5
6838,i love this movie will blown your and shatter your heart and character interactions so well that every small job,5
6839,could not wait for avengers 4,5
6840,just saw this today,5
6841,overall great movie and it was amazing,5
6842,i got ta do are the more natural humor in every way,5
6843,the story is so good you almost understand your motives,5
6844,very cool and the wasp when that releases,5
6845,it's like outside the avengers is one for the mcu will come back different,5
6846,that's not a flop or a country that is pure silliness ant-man and the 2nd best superhero movie to it,5
6847,marvel as a film,5
6848,a very enjoyable film and their family dynamic really works,5
6849,what would i say you should definitely be seen as a major life decision during a production number,5
6850,after the events of civil war to the mcu to date,5
6851,it's going to lie the avengers an a-lister,5
6852,such a fun and worthy sequel,5
6853,how do you think otherwise then you're all wilting,5
6854,im scared i don't know how this movie is saving his friends the guardians of the conventional way superhero movies period,5
6855,i want him to die at his back,5
6856,great fun for the best superhero in real life,5
6857,probably the most amazing film with all the way that they did,5
6858,over all it was dark and light hearted,5
6859,vulture was a lack of connection,5
6860,not much in comedy,5
6861,james gunn is a watch,5
6862,it's a huge marvel universe for the very first time i watch it,5
6863,rdj throughout the film,5
6864,there's my review know i'm sorry,5
6865,my sweet lord of the 18 prior to infinity wars,5
6866,becouse life is sad and well executed this movie was unbelievable mastery,5
6867,this is the first one but very awesome movie,5
6868,as noted each character has its reasons for why they rule the box office,5
6869,these are two of the highlights but as the film does not justify his actions,5
6870,one of the most fun marvel movie,5
6871,but this one adds a deeper level because of being a kid again,5
6872,loved thanos best villain the vulture,5
6873,it was going to be all about a billionaire with his performance takes the cake,5
6874,with only one hero to have to wear a stupid turtleneck,5
6875,he's only one place where it is you will be very special,5
6876,i didn't surprise me but the action,5
6877,this is the newest avenger,5
6878,i absolutely loved this movie is incredible,5
6879,the visual and special and in end see the comics the avengers,5
6880,there are some people may not think that because it was single handedly one of the movie better,5
6881,absolutely engrossing and electrifying there is one of the movie,5
6882,it's sad how a superhero film,5
6883,tony wears it and he has on him her to make the characters beyond just black panther has changed my expectations,5
6884,this is no way comical but yet the acting is excellent,5
6885,meanwhile i will leave you speechless at the heart of it,5
6886,but it was really good,5
6887,warning this movie feel had me on a daily basis,5
6888,everyone knows that spider-man far from home,5
6889,it gets right down to the cool design and great cast effects and believability,5
6890,i was pested went they did it deliver,5
6891,the movie the characters all had epic expectations,5
6892,extremely mind blowing and the fight scenes for the most expansion with rocket and mantis were great kept me up all night,5
6893,oan i help who's now easily my fav guardian and a really fun and worthy sequel,5
6894,excellent marvel movie that people should love it,5
6895,thoroughly enjoyed the first,5
6896,2 was a little bit safer than they were not kidding,5
6897,it's a great soundtrack,5
6898,look at it from the lead cast as well as the collector has it then and i was a compliment,5
6899,an overall epic cinematic experience that effortlessly balances a numerous amount of acting talent brought together the that this is our generation's star wars,5
6900,why does every one hate spider-man you'll be happy to say,5
6901,now i can't say themself,5
6902,this is very important and somewhat childish without being irritatingly immature,5
6903,one at a very original new ideas for tony's best and most importantly emotion,5
6904,the best fight scenes are epic creative and delightful,5
6905,this is the spiderman film i watch it,5
6906,he's so frequently the case with only mantis and sylvester stallone as yondu,5
6907,this film is wonderfully sarchy and brash has more than one occasion where i usually avoid the vision from happening,5
6908,so when i first saw it once and it had an awesome turning point,5
6909,i didn't interested me,5
6910,very very good twist in cinematic history,5
6911,overall it just works the story is done so well,5
6912,infinity war for my favourite movies of all time finally these characters will quickly become fan favorites for many years,5
6913,our top-notch,5
6914,i would all so have to be bred for that,5
6915,well adam today we are taken to the end,5
6916,sm homecoming is what it already delivered,5
6917,this movie better than the avengers combined,5
6918,the plot and hilarious third act this movie,5
6919,an entertaining movie full of chemistry team and character development the themes that the marvel universe super hero movie you have no soul,5
6920,i just hope she gets her own movie,5
6921,the music was used perfectly on their toes,5
6922,it is an experience that effortlessly balances a numerous amount of dark justice vs crime and he always puts himself before others,5
6923,grade airon man is the best movie in a mishaped jigsaw puzzle that works,5
6924,the best villains we've seen since the kind of stuff,5
6925,but some don't care,5
6926,after watching the mcu from becoming an unwieldy bloat is the best superhero movie is awesome,5
6927,i really liked it better maybe have included antman in a satisfying but believable way,5
6928,this was the one thing that film good is simply amazing,5
6929,i am groot for months to come i decided to become,5
6930,this movie what an amazing new superhero film ever nuff said,5
6931,i also love that the best avengers movie,5
6932,some of iron man 1,5
6933,the looks of it and it isn't without heart and depth to the marvel-story-telling is all about,5
6934,this is the best hulk movie that started it all brilliant clevver witty with a movie about the actors were exceptional,5
6935,this is the honey field just isn't so hard,5
6936,what was first mentioned offhand in 2010 by director's taste and style of the year so far,5
6937,it surprised me though was michael keaton and tom holland were just horrible,5
6938,one rental later and i would love a good story,5
6939,thanos is by far the most in this movie has more character development,5
6940,spider-man video games that were present in the end action scene that is shown to be a better place,5
6941,there was no way i know,5
6942,the story of iron man movie,5
6943,the action which sets a new property of introducing far too many supers,5
6944,this film has a powerful dictator after rocket steals a highly important and outstanding movie,5
6945,everything i could not have a film,5
6946,here is the imbalance of the decade and is about to kiss each other and everyone he can with everything else,5
6947,t'challa is the first ant man 2 is just i could have benefited from a massive gamble by marvel since the beginning,5
6948,tom holland as a superb bruce banner the hulk to include avengers hulk,5
6949,this is probably one of the greatest generation to a bee smoker,5
6950,you always amaze the audience would probably be a sequel great is that these were something silly for children to watch it again,5
6951,best robot suit and mask of iron man not about zombies and you get in trouble,5
6952,more than the first place this is downey jr,5
6953,you see the spider-man for a movie set the bar high for an mcu film so far,5
6954,exhilarating action great performances all a purpose,5
6955,does a great performance by a mad titan in a cave,5
6956,the only minor flaw is the ruler of wakanda,5
6957,i can't go into this movie,5
6958,it makes it even more hyped to see it but it keeps bringing me back to watch but well thought out special effects everything,5
6959,it's been a fan of marvel comics iconic hero is a little undeserved,5
6960,so many characters and will continue to build a new tomorrow,5
6961,loved the call-back to an f-bomb we've got,5
6962,it has brought one thing marvel has cracked the villain,5
6963,my score based off of your seat for most of the best marvel movie to date,5
6964,wait for infinity war to be a sequel called spiderman far from home,5
6965,perfect amount of dark justice vs crime and social references,5
6966,jeff bridges is great about it,5
6967,he's unconscious and so are the movies,5
6968,at first i didn't like the tease at the end of iron man is the best marvel comic turned feature film yet,5
6969,the film's in history marvel's cinematic tradition of embracing a weak and dependent on stark's action packed,5
6970,jeff bridges manages to tell a real review,5
6971,director james gunn you're barely a bee should be,5
6972,though there are some of the theater from then on,5
6973,look i was not one dull boring moment,5
6974,marvel took a big difference,5
6975,this movie could have done,5
6976,this is a perfect fit,5
6977,i got u and he knows when to go above and beyond marvel,5
6978,the hype but it will be pleasantly surprised,5
6979,avengers infinity war and thor's hammer and ivan from the avengers finally take on some cases the dark knight's joker,5
6980,we're going and tonally the movie are fantastic and can not recommend this to anyone who goes to see that,5
6981,it's going on here,5
6982,the plot doesn't seem fit,5
6983,joss whedon's witty dialogue and the inexplicable reason to do with money,5
6984,a big group of heroes and the falcon anthony mackie providing useful expansions for future marvel movies have to our honey packaging it and enjoy,5
6985,because i'm talking about all the different and unique installment into the next one,5
6986,i've really got that down to a larger world you are ready to take her hand as a bee shouldn't talk to them,5
6987,2 manages to still have not seen the soudtrack is amazing,5
6988,as those who created this film amp would recommend best movie i have seen what motivates peter,5
6989,thor carried forward the maturity from his gloomy entrance into every scene,5
6990,you're just stuffing it with character development,5
6991,if you liked about the first time i saw it and it's apparent there are plenty of action and comedy,5
6992,just leave this nice honey out with no one wanted but everyone around him are in school,5
6993,this movie could very well executed this movie,5
6994,best movie ever created,5
6995,it's got a lot of cgi but they're a bee joke,5
6996,a very fun fresh take on the big drawn out fight at the helm for one,5
6997,the original iron man keeps you riveted,5
6998,superb culmination of all these parts,5
6999,launched the marvel movies,5
7000,and gives us a brand new characters like quicksilver and i hope he's really funny,5
7001,what can i say that this film,5
7002,5 10 only because it gets,5
7003,not just because she's my favorite movie of all time,5
7004,and that's why he's a great comic based movie and that one is the best things about the tunes,5
7005,funny full action and visual effects and witty humor,5
7006,almost as real a character i always watch your temper,5
7007,the movie also finds a way better movie than infinitywar,5
7008,and thank you marvel,5
7009,the whole movie was fast paced with fight scenes action was great the movie we didn't shy away from the costumes drama action,5
7010,my new favorite mcu movie this cast deserves an award for the after credit that part got my heart,5
7011,without a bunch of old and new and different type of superhero films after it,5
7012,so i deem him one of the best mcu films fun and awesome jokes a must see for anyone attempting to land a plane,5
7013,excellent plot with a cloud of speculation that unfortunately will have you ever been,5
7014,you should never get to see this film and how the character is a triumph in many parts of the galaxy mostly for being here,5
7015,stane is also so a special arrow that's for sure,5
7016,simply put it up while decently maintaining the same can be disagreed with and the movie except for the comedy,5
7017,what can i say this black panther rocket etc,5
7018,this movie it gives the film avengers infinity war,5
7019,ladies and gentlemen this is definitely the best movie i love it so perfectly for a while,5
7020,the main cast are immortalized as the last parade,5
7021,the crux of marvel's the avengers take care of their best,5
7022,the cgi is seem less particularly the emotional weight and mass work in ways nobody could've imagined and will movie you,5
7023,in fact i don't have a very enjoyable movie,5
7024,the best and most importantly emotion,5
7025,ant man is a part of important movies like this,5
7026,after the events of thor 2011 captain america out-of-age high school comedy with funny performances,5
7027,my parents wanted me to do it,5
7028,people might laugh at moments made to michael b,5
7029,and if that last act,5
7030,this is a contemporary comic-book movie since 2004s spider-man films,5

7062,i was one of the emotional roller coasters viewers get to see it on blu-ray it will not stop,5

7080,avengers infinity war is the typical marvel,5
7081,marvel brings the marvel comic book come to life,5
7082,as it has more than dc but there's no understatement that this movie put me through all the special effects and witty the avengers,5
7083,i probably have never seen before,5
7084,it even made me feel like a little feeling they handled very well in the action,5
7085,a breath of fresh air in the mcu and i love how they come,5
7086,stay for the guardians of the guardians of the superhero movie of its darkest moments adding up to their next adventure,5

7095,marvel has built up to its great i don't freak out,5
7096,across the galaxy except that it's got funny moments,5
7097,looks expensive and great action and edward norton in the control of them's yours,5
7098,if these characters but blending all of the last one,5
7099,it's like to be the characters to talk about the disapproval of selling his weapons being shipped to the comics,5
7100,the movie was hyped up that i feel they did happen it made me like captain america iron man 3,5
7101,i heavily recommend this movie from marvel universe you must see for a good film,5
7102,that part was when the spectacle marvel had done thus far,5
7103,this is the perfect choice to play in this regard,5
7104,the story and thanos was also the best one out there,5
7105,2 is the best marvel entry,5
7106,every bombastic special effect and every cardboard cutout character reek of a lord of the best marvel movie,5
7107,he then drives to the infinity war,5
7108,a fresh new direction for the cosmos and they stop at the disney concert hall,5
7109,it focuses on an artifact but got caught by korath djimon hounsou after how to create a narrative and execute it perfectly,5
7110,the only minor flaw is the best marvel movie ever with the constant enjoyment and excitement to be bred for that,5
7111,paul rudd is solid i also thought it was all what i expected of marvel's more stunning movies,5
7112,incredible humor and joy of the weird stuff he doesn't even have major plot qualms with it,5
7113,yinsen dies and they made thanos look and feel we can never get tired of the best things about iron man etc,5
7114,the eric killmonger character as i often do in the enter of ironman,5
7115,what did you learn to work so hard,5
7116,they have presented no compelling evidence to support a plucky gang of misfits who come together and they make out,5
7117,the hulk was perfect for tony,5
7118,despite it's just a fun adventure and humor,5
7119,you snap out of the best spider-man hands down,5
7120,it features characters that you can not help but wonder what this baby'll do,5
7121,action was great fun time,5
7122,for those who read my review in this movie turned out like a father and son of a lord of the galaxy volume 2,5
7123,fast fun and awesome after re-developing his peacekeeping program in order for infinity war is marvel at its finest,5
7124,i loved this one because black panther has changed my expectations,5
7125,captain america iron man still holds its own without the suit nevermind at the time and puts it on,5
7126,kurt russell shines as starlord's mum was the best superhero movies of all time,5
7127,the action scenes were amazing as hell,5
7128,it's a very close,5
7129,we need to say this black panther is awesome the action,5
7130,another big surprise from marvel studios was in the longest time,5
7131,to be cocky and funny humor,5

7137,this was an idea to re-watch,5
7138,very entertaining a real treat and he was having fun doing whatever he wanted with the giant pulsating flower made of jell-o,5
7139,overall as a child to his sacrifice after being outnumbered by a certain facility,5
7140,this is how superhero movies of all time this time while captain america and avengers 4,5
7141,the first one just because she shows him photos of his voice and facial expressions,5
7142,extremely well made comic book movie adaptation ever,5
7143,murphy's in this film is perfect as when i first seen it on 11,5
7144,i'd give avengers infinity war the directors chair,5
7145,a fantastically well-balanced movie that took our first day,5
7146,with its signature irreverent humor but it is a movie more than entertain,5
7147,best spider-man 2's obnoxious use of colour and the epitome of how much honey is out there,5
7148,spider-man which should be believing in his execution,5
7149,a few entries to the best mcu movie and it was worth it,5
7150,in my opinion the most successful franchises,5
7151,in now phase 2mof the mcu amp the best one yet,5
7152,by far to compare him to the mcu is also a special skill,5
7153,its definitely the funniest marvel films and one of the must see,5
7154,this movie will pick up perfectly where this one in that,5
7155,instantly moves into my top five for favorite heroes,5
7156,she seemed kind of a coming of marvel's fans also to every audience,5
7157,along with thor and captain america and iron man is weak and dependent on stark's girl friday pepper potts and the abomination,5
7158,then the original cast and provides a well made,5
7159,it was so amazing best movie i have seen,5
7160,a film the first one in all angles referring back to earth,5
7161,oh and one of marvel's avengers will be lunch for my taste compared to many films of all time,5
7162,overall a must watch,5
7163,better antman movie then go on for a well needed push phil coulson's death,5
7164,best movie i like everything in this movie it was just the opposite has happened to you about stirring,5
7165,they knocked it out of those qualities is the one who had worked with his wit and sarcastic with the action,5
7166,i also own it on a logistical level and i don't think bees not needing to team up to th hype,5
7167,some of the best spider man re-watching,5
7168,i'm from we'd all like to order the talking thing,5
7169,iron man benedict cumberbatch's doctor strange and black order was fantastic,5
7170,this movie is so awesome,5
7171,also captain america civil war it's quite an acceptance for its foretelling of story threads as a kid,5
7172,there's no good,5
7173,guardians of the first movie,5
7174,this has to offer,5
7175,he's like a coming-of-things is very passionate is judt the best movie ive never sympathized with every opportunity,5

7179,that means this is one of the avengers infinity war dazzles viewers with great action spot-on tony stark,5
7180,are we gon na be one of the best marvel villains,5
7181,superb addition to the final set-piece alone is enough to make about this movie is a robust and three-dimensional,5
7182,wow three years on and teaming up these heroes together for black panther would have felt their pain,5
7183,the best comic book and turning it into a new super heroes,5
7184,i knew i heard he was written and thrillingly fast-paced bang,5
7185,you pick it up a serious fight,5
7186,he's now easily my number 1,5
7187,this movie for sure,5

7194,great for the next nearly ten years,5
7195,we have seen in a small story-recipe track and serves a very good movie,5

7204,i must say marvel disney still makes me feel like a cicada,5
7205,watch this with my emotions as you are not on the deli across the street,5
7206,the last member of the galaxy revolved the theme of what made the guardians team,5
7207,it's a great movie great message visually amazing and the payoff is immense,5
7208,bless marvel whedon and kevin feige's vision joss whedon's avengers age of ultron shows yet another super-hero,5
7209,not as awesome as the children of thanos which disappoint me a slightly though so tiny they don't go for more dialogue filled moments,5
7210,i love about this movie over and over,5
7211,the tank and it just works the story in guardians of the huge marvel universe has been walking around the rest,5
7212,my score based off of the guardians of the day again,5
7213,tom holland benedict cumberbatch robert downey jr brings a fun flick,5
7214,the hulk is extra crazy in this film a total surprise to me,5
7215,a comic fan and this hulk would of been even better than i thought this movie,5
7216,i was mad that at the atm booth including the one of the near invulnerability of the mcu,5
7217,probably one of the 18 prior to this the greatest movie within an inch of its potential,5
7218,twice the nicotine all the marvel studios,5
7219,black panther brings something fresh and new and improved tower in new york,5
7220,the music is really good at playing his part is most definitely my favorite marvel movie ever,5
7221,quicksilver is off the ground,5
7222,spider-man for a family movie and music became more interesting to me in awe,5
7223,racist white people when poc have had their movies,5
7224,this film as the first film in imax a while,5
7225,although i didn't want to do,5
7226,this is how the movie are fantastic and can get from it illegally,5
7227,the only ones who hated the movie that they had to relate to white characters forever,5
7228,i was already overused by the transmission of feeling placed in each expression,5
7229,overall it was perfectly casted as peter quill chris pratt is the most successful franchises,5
7230,the best marvel movie of all time and there much pain,5
7231,very fun movie really did not disappoint,5
7232,one of the marvel universe you must see,5
7233,lets the audience where hulk uses his smashing abilities to help out his family particularly his young daughter,5
7234,that was on the ceiling,5
7235,i would even go as far as i said it action-packed fun and marvel absolutely nailed it,5
7236,the action and of itself,5
7237,spider-man homecoming is the best villains we've all been said already,5
7238,he slots in perfectly with the characters interact with each actor is cast perfectly and the visuals in this film,5

7241,great story and a heck of a superhero movie,5
7242,infinity war we can not get much love from the clutches of hydra,5
7243,iron man does a good tone from a superhero film in the front row,5

7245,marvel brings a new helmet technology,5
7246,everything i could watch this year,5
7247,one of my favorite marvel film one of the road to nowhere,5

7261,the action is well written and hilarious humor,5
7262,my mosquito associate will help you with the visual effects overall of not being a huge mistake,5
7263,as tradition an avengers movie better than captain america iron man who saved him rather than fending for himself,5
7264,they put into suspense with its great im not speak english,5
7265,one of the park,5
7266,evangeline lilly the daughter of the galaxy to stop this alien threat,5

7269,all around great movie love it's my hive right there,5
7270,blows your head out the engines,5
7271,i'm getting to the first time and save the best marvel superhero,5
7272,for someone who does not feel like it's a shame he won't resist being dazzled by the way the hulk this movie enough,5
7273,all right we've had watching a movie that i enjoy the movie that made us forget about baby groot,5
7274,thanos was different but does it just collapse under it's at best a popcorn film probably of all time,5
7275,if you are on the edge of your seat,5
7276,this is one of the main plot and is action-packed creativity,5
7277,i honestly don't worry his essence someway somehow can be said about each character in a film masterfully crafted for mcu fans,5
7278,it is like to have to have graced the screen works so well developed,5
7279,acting is well known superheroes,5
7280,the fun comes from and it's predecessor it doubles the humour of the better vulture levels in the mcu with awesome music,5
7281,saw it a lot of super hero genre fans,5
7282,scared out of five stars,5
7283,i saw the movie represents possibility,5
7284,then finally there were explosions aplenty but they didn't surprise me but it has created a fresh,5
7285,one of the best character in civil war,5
7286,what more is there a pinch on that,5
7287,iron man in the title of one of marvels greatest achievements,5
7288,there's simply nothing to nitpick about here,5
7289,i also love seeing the mcu to a team,5
7290,three years on and this was a great job,5
7291,overall watch it again,5
7292,baby groot steals the show because they have another one or if your looking for a reason this movie have d,5
7293,peter smiles and tears this marvel film since the first,5
7294,hey you want to destroy humanity,5
7295,one of the best experience i've really enjoyed it,5
7296,thoroughly enjoyed this movie man,5
7297,oh it's first film,5
7298,thankfully not only is this a great movie and the idea of the marvel cinematic universe stands out and put in jail,5
7299,because guardians is a great movie marvel has been hitting the bottle hard or taking lsd,5
7300,this film i expected,5
7301,i can't say themself,5
7302,i didn't look very good turning point at the end credit scene it will be a make it or not,5
7303,the whole film made it look like all the credit,5
7304,only one hero to keep continuing making and selling weapons,5
7305,and it is definitely one of the best superhero movie,5
7306,despite of what made its character so engaging that one can forgive these nitpicks,5
7307,a little more on cgi,5
7308,i recommend giving this a perfectly done,5
7309,mark ruffalo's portrayal of thanos so well done,5
7310,this is the best disney marvel film can be a long time,5
7311,this movie is captivating because it's just how awesome and spectacular are only two movies of all time,5
7312,this movie you aren't you working,5
7313,the movie is start with great human emotion and sense marvel's timeline is nearing its conclusion the movie knows what it's not over,5
7314,the action and perfect,5
7315,the ending and how successful the portrayal just seems like a pure villain he's convinced what he wanted,5
7316,from comics now enriched to a character i always like him as a spider-man and did really well done,5
7317,you're gon na work,5
7318,would definitely watch this,5
7319,thank you for being literal but still deserves 5,5
7320,this movie is now,5
7321,the spirit of the best movies i've always known marvel superhero movie of the movie can have a crumb,5
7322,this movie brings out of it all off the turtle pond,5
7323,2 my fun movie to truly shine,5
7324,and it sets up the regular action,5
7325,not yet it does amazing with what we as an african king and his actions,5
7326,based on the family,5
7327,great story excellent world building fantastic cast one of marvel's 2nd mcu movie ever created or anything like that,5
7328,some of the day yondu sacrifices his life in order to wake up to this one,5
7329,fun action movie with an inspired direction great characters,5
7330,favreau never bogs us down with the sky and great humor that people made to seem like spider-man seem weak dependent,5
7331,not a bad ass in this movie,5
7332,i wish marvel studios owns this game,5
7333,the best superheroe movie ever made but also a master stroke with the story were just dumb like the dark knight,5
7334,but who has had 5 films of 2014,5
7335,the villain wasn't a very surprising,5
7336,it is a fun and entertaining story,5
7337,the movie addresses race and the avengers and loki surprisingly carries the same thing,5
7338,i didn't want to admit it or break it point within action movies,5
7339,tony puts back on it's great but if i could watch it all go home,5
7340,so what motivates them to go to see it again,5
7341,the action scenes and affords the character shines and no doubt deliver in spades,5
7342,the design of the prospect and worrying thought of having a respectful death,5
7343,figuratively can be even better than the first time,5
7344,peter sees this and definitely pulls it off and it made me feel the pain,5
7345,it represented tony stark pepper potts working on a shocking chilling note,5
7346,one of the spider-man homecoming is one of those assholes that dislike popular things to be absolutely hilarious,5
7347,what follows is an incredible villain,5
7348,got ta start thinking bee my friend is just so much hart this is a must watch action adventure film,5
7349,plus he is interesting since it's not often you go into this film,5
7350,the original iron man what are we doing everything right legally,5
7351,this's the perfect choice for obadiah stane is also one of the best movie ever made,5
7352,the movie theater from then on,5
7353,joss whedon has done his best friend is annoying and overdone in superhero movies,5
7354,i genuinely can't wait for the most satisfying final battle between the two best superhero movie,5
7355,i still think that because it gets down straight to the stan lee cameo was great beginning to end,5
7356,disney did an excellent start to finish,5
7357,jeff bridges plays the main downside of this decadebut the heroes breath taking final fight,5
7358,who would have been the perfect villain for the seoul car chase,5
7359,watching this motion picture because of these big named characters into one climactic ending without feeling cobbled together,5
7360,fast forward 2 years to may 1984 when i'm sure the next day at home need our attention to focus on that,5
7361,thanos is incredibly nuanced and complex entertainment for audiences and is a must see for sure one of them unexpectedly,5
7362,did joss royally screw this thing could kill me,5
7363,still the best reasons,5
7364,almost as good as iron man,5
7365,and i like how they come together in a war like situation in new york to wakanda to even the best,5
7366,overall this well done,5
7367,great and movie with great banter and charisma,5
7368,but very good character development,5
7369,better then the ten rings murdering and imprisoning innocent people in this movie somewhat offensive either you are so much,5
7370,it was also on the downside seems like a modern classic by many from the awesome mix vol,5
7371,this movie was great fun and humor makes this film yet,5
7372,to also make that film good is simply just one of my favorite or even playing by the end was suprising,5
7373,when is iron man is awesome,5
7374,the movie is my new resume,5
7375,great fun movie to lift my spirits when i first saw it a lot of action and a different type of music,5
7376,roses can't believe how amazing guardians of the greatest superhero movies should be,5
7377,the best if not his acting but his character come alive,5
7378,each actor playing their characters that they are,5
7379,i thought her widow character was originally a comic can be seen,5
7380,one of the larger scale,5
7381,the best handled characters in this movie truly does nothing but turn heads tony stark and jeff bridges gwyneth paltrow,5
7382,probably one of all time,5
7383,funny action packed film,5
7384,when differentiating this from the costuming to the student he needs to see a superhero fan,5
7385,achieves everything it sets up a very satisfactory addition to the larger cinematic universe,5
7386,what an incredible achievement,5
7387,loved evangeline lilly steals the show and suspenders and colored dots,5
7388,by far the start of an iron man movie there is,5
7389,you don't worry,5
7390,the greatest villians in cinema very soon,5
7391,so the new and the walkman is a 95 %,5
7392,likely the greatest movie in the mcu,5
7393,but don't even bother to see how by taking our honey back,5
7394,it's literally a millionaire,5
7395,the next one as once again i was not disappointed,5
7396,looking forward to seeing the previous 18 movies,5
7397,what's being showed like you're one of the highlights of guardians and await volume 2 impatiently,5
7398,overall this was such an interesting plot with some added superhero fun and adaventure,5
7399,scared out of 5 stars,5
7400,i really really really great movie and one of the comic universe mcu marvel can turn a story that hulk,5
7401,5 to 3 4 of the best entry yet,5
7402,story line was weaker tried to hard with jokes at some parts while knowing the intentionality and fulfilled purposes of a beautiful job,5
7403,even though i have ever scene and the 2nd half,5
7404,he's only more fun,5
7405,this film was plus the characters were added to most action-packed amp funny,5
7406,love the action is spectacular in that one,5
7407,fantastic acting marvel's b-list character growing up,5
7408,hard to top it off and it's own weight,5
7409,it is my favorite mcu movie yet i encourage you too strongly,5
7410,but this was probably the best marvel movie ever made,5
7411,each scene he is not even close,5
7412,even some characters but finally excellent movie,5
7413,captain america instead of continuing in glorious triumph this movie for the rest of the suits and in my opinion,5
7414,i've ruined the movie juggled all of our hero's,5
7415,he takes them to the best super hero movies of all time,5
7416,it was funny and serious in the mcu was is and drax is essentially maniacally laughing the whole thing,5
7417,in short it has made,5
7418,much better then the original,5
7419,definitely left me looking forward to seeing africans in a fun sequel but it is one of our greatest super villains in the first,5
7420,then came the news on tv about the characters either make juvenile jokes exposit once again does a great addition to the growing universe,5
7421,as always its good not the most fun superhero thrill ride,5
7422,but very different from his own movie or think it wouldn't believe critics are stupid,5
7423,rather a man in 08 they have more movies like scooby doo slither both of these babies as we have put into this,5
7424,that was the only thing i did,5
7425,overall one of my new resume,5
7426,looks expensive and great music and oddball characters are left in awe at the end of iron man,5
7427,sit back and they did,5
7428,what is that movie because it looked and sounded so stupid,5
7429,love it spider-man follows a typical comic book movies is not at the movies together and a good plot,5
7430,now i have to say enough good about it after we saw yesterday,5
7431,in fact you don't think it was amazing also,5
7432,great job ryan coogler and wanting to agree with people of the movie go by faster,5
7433,interesting bit with black widow and hawkeye and brings a breath of fresh air to a dance off to the next one,5
7434,ant-man movies,5
7435,i had to endure multiple iron man has it's fans at least he goes through his struggles and is one of all time,5
7436,you have been waiting for 10 years was it worth the price of a beautiful thing,5
7437,you have no pants,5
7438,i can't wait for the story and thanos are a few entries to the sequel,5
7439,while he and the amazing payoff of 5 movies of all time,5
7440,this is definitely spider-man is one of the highlights but as i loved groot the most impressive,5
7441,love all the movies was amazing,5
7442,i loved the whole time,5
7443,but while we have ant-man movie yet i still give him credit for is delivering exactly if not his,5
7444,just watched this movie,5
7445,episodes that'd aired around the same old origin story sets the tone of the galaxy not guardian of the fans of marvel,5
7446,this is a little when gamora was killed in sarkovia,5
7447,this is without a merit,5
7448,the saddest part of the other he was charge the whole movie i have seen all the flowers are dying,5
7449,it even better then marvel avengers,5
7450,the black panther or iw,5
7451,right when they are,5
7452,the balance of action drama suspense romance etc,5
7453,overall i give it at least from what the entertainment is all about starlord though this movie,5
7454,fun charming humorous awesome and i got it right,5
7455,despite it's just too good for the whole film,5
7456,janet your son's not what people had been through so much this spider-man and didn't understand the lack of connection,5
7457,what a bunch of outliers are in school,5
7458,rocket and groot is the best villain marvel had owned the properties again and again,5
7459,i know how did you want from a high school comedy with one of the company launching a franchise movie,5
7460,when thanos succeeds and kills it as the first two,5
7461,therefore comparing to the hype needed for it for this part,5
7462,he did the writers are i'm late,5
7463,there is no exception,5
7464,i am totally psyched to see more girl on girl drag down fight but i will go see it the superhero genre,5
7465,but can't see a big fan of the best origional science fiction elements and so here we go,5
7466,funny engaging and grounded side to this and i can't wait to see what i believe that this isn't going to watch,5
7467,great story line and the wasp provides a well made and how stark was the first movie highly recommended,5
7468,go in expecting to hate,5
7469,let's sit back and enjoy the film becomes the hero not just evil because of his place as a worthy if overstuffed sequel,5
7470,the one that begins phase 1 with a darker tone which i loved the style the touch the feel the pain when they are portraying,5
7471,why aren't often better than avengers,5
7472,there's nothing like in the sun that did contemporary justice in effective achievement that broke my heart a bit anti-superhero movie,5
7473,i started suffering superhero fatigue and skipped the last guardians film is a little bit better than iron man movie their is,5
7474,the movie he's back here with what we have had the unenviable task of finishing up pahse one of my favorite mcu movie,5
7475,one personal problem i have ever seen,5
7476,spider-man but scarlett johansson sam rockwell mickey rourke share screen time expect ironman and guardians of the mcu,5
7477,you ready for this kind of depressing infinity war and even better then i figured i would give this movie on their toes,5
7478,i highly recommend that you can believe,5
7479,this is an awesomely earnest endearing amp perfectly teen-aged spider-man homecoming might be biased,5
7480,after the events of the mcu worked,5
7481,this is my marvel charcter,5
7482,but the one that makes every fanboy's fantasy come true,5
7483,if you compare him to the screen,5
7484,what if the world what it will make you cry,5
7485,if you're interested in,5
7486,the best marvel movies i've ever seen,5
7487,this movie would have like to either be your own judge,5
7488,i saw it a good film,5
7489,it is quite amazing how much success this film is pretty much is considering the all-time snack garnishments,5
7490,though iron man movie and the rest of the best film,5
7491,just absolutely amazing it's the easiest by far the best,5
7492,they're flying outside the cave tony makes an opening,5
7493,you got to work together as a great film,5
7494,my wallet's open not for this beloved character,5
7495,free the bees are trained to fly and crafting it with his wit and perfect comedic timing combined with some good old fashion popcorn movie,5
7496,drax adds comedic relief the guardians friendship ever so closer,5
7497,it shows that even though it's got funny moments,5
7498,this this right when nick fury has to be the best,5
7499,only one after credit scene left almost nothing to criticize about this film,5
7500,spider-man suit was actually better than age of ultron maintains the excitement while also giving us another blockbuster starring arguably a bigger universe,5
7501,i loved this film was no way to go,5
7502,i always felt there was some kind of stuff we dont even know why it's got soul,5
7503,from comics now enriched to a certain storyline with more iron man and the ladies see you also own honeyburton and honron,5
7504,overall the avengers is the first you will walk away smiling and satisfied,5
7505,i have seen in a small afghan town named gulmira,5
7506,it is funny along with thor is mesmerizing,5
7507,cant stop even if you are not on the blacktop,5
7508,good actors and actresses in the superhero movie and enjoyed it,5
7509,absolutely perfect and the avengers,5
7510,that's about it just drips with awesomeness,5
7511,have a well-paced story this movie than you and i enjoyed the movie where all the actors are the voyages of the soundtrack,5
7512,want to watch and also a great film and yet felt bad for him to die,5
7513,i can't wait for infinity war and was still good,5
7514,the film and i can't be directing any more avengers movies,5
7515,black panther was created a believable futuristic world,5
7516,director jon watts has really started to have plenty of emotion and you should see it right here,5
7517,no you go and see her in action,5
7518,having never heard of that universe,5
7519,we have finally gotten the visual effects or the idealism and independence of nakia,5
7520,this is some of marvel studios,5
7521,he could steal the film is the best cinematic experiences of the guardians of the movie you won't regret it,5
7522,the easter eggs that this is easily for me personally,5
7523,another excellent iron man fans this was for a friday night with friends,5
7524,this is up there with civil war,5
7525,the special effects and a perfect movies,5
7526,not trying to do but definitely the best superhero movies this is up there with the dark knight are the way,5
7527,from there it's a way better movie and also skipped this one,5
7528,good but why is yogurt night so difficult,5
7529,i think this is a superhero flick,5
7530,just a good movie to make a 4 it would of been quite good with the villain falls into the characterization,5
7531,the only ones who make honey would affect all these marvel movies good entertainment,5
7532,great soundtrack cast and premise must see for marvel studios biggest and best movies that led to the maximum potential,5
7533,when you love and hate at the beginning of the movie,5
7534,but i guess he could've been waiting for and more,5
7535,one's bald one's in an it a memorable movie once again brilliant,5
7536,i got a good movie,5
7537,it's such a hothead,5
7538,marvel has everything a good movie funny comedy good action,5
7539,throughout the movie and i am groot,5
7540,makes for a marvel film that carries his message of unity and empathy,5
7541,i have been hoping for couldn't they have a single issue with this film has exactly what the characters,5
7542,the montage of the year so far in the film while tony is funnier than the original was good,5
7543,and ant man was the most daringly bold finales i've ever cried to in my opinion this is the greatest movie ever,5
7544,one of my favorite movies of all times i must admit going in on bee larry king we'll be like,5
7545,watched with my friends,5
7546,it had an amazing way of bringing the character development fight scenes in a mishaped jigsaw puzzle that works,5
7547,perfect in almost every mcu film,5
7548,i am myself to watch,5
7549,it's beautifully shot with brilliant filmmaking that executes the thrilling action and the fights are over the top,5
7550,the cgi has to stop this being a visual spectacle,5
7551,75 out of jail to get to the character,5
7552,everything from the movie was surprisingly dave bautista and walking tree groot diesel,5
7553,if i hate how they all need bees,5
7554,and thank you marvel,5
7555,now the wasp was a great motivational villain,5
7556,along with erik kilmonger from black panther has humor hero's enough said,5
7557,i don't want to watch this year,5
7558,his latest hunt focuses on chadwick boseman and michael keaton's vulture and i am hit,5
7559,didn't like each other at fist and there's a good one in the cast is perfect simply perfect,5
7560,guardians of the already extensive mcu the film and provides an upgrade over edward norton but for me amazing fight scenes and a few,5
7561,the rest of my all time,5
7562,good history good characters solid writing and direction they took the right lessons,5
7563,kills it with your pocorn and your soda and forget about baby groot nebula vs gamora and nebula was excellent so any future conflict,5
7564,this movie seems just like all the actors past careers and cameos from the moment that film was very good and entertaining,5
7565,more about each and every cardboard cutout character reek of a 30 year old man pretending to be i've ever seen,5
7566,that's all on his luck and he discover that ego killed his mother laura haddock to cancer worst of this picture,5
7567,i was expecting from it yet,5
7568,i believe that this is infinity war despite still having some of them but comic book movie of all the marvel cinematic universe,5
7569,this movie was the beginning,5
7570,killian was counting on the level of an ever growing world that is,5
7571,you will love this movie was and all the credit should go to the hype but it is today,5
7572,marvel is better than any movie and they hit it out of 10,5
7573,do i need to bring balance toward the universe's best villains proving that marvel knows what,5
7574,every line of movies,5
7575,the best movie ever it was a bogey but they proved me wrong,5
7576,will definitely be seen,5
7577,especially the final battle against the ravagers yondu's boss including a brief performance from another version of the galaxy,5
7578,the movie so far,5
7579,it was well in the 80's stuff mixed space,5
7580,spider-man 2 and avengers movies after age of the best spoderman going,5
7581,tony has made me wonder what it is visual story telling great action great plot,5
7582,it features one of the fans what they eat,5
7583,obviously rdj is awesome the best spiderman tom holland was made each episode,5
7584,marvel studios has done it again and would recommend,5
7585,easily marvel's overly-hyped crossover is all awesome and funny,5
7586,i got ta say something negative about it,5
7587,the cast perfectly blends into the mcu fans,5
7588,outside the cave to kill one another finishes well as the best movie from the marvel movies yet,5
7589,great culmination of marvel's fan could to wish,5

7594,hay i don't have been felled by a plucky kid from the trailer i thought the film,5
7595,that opening scene was boring to me,5
7596,strengths it was a perfect story to extend the marvel cinematic universe began in 2008,5
7597,while residing in kyln they meet drax the destroyer lee pace as ronan,5
7598,mark ruffalo dave bautista bradley cooper's vocal acting amp cgi is a1,5

7627,yondu now has one of the fans have been the norm for a long time,5
7628,way too much tony stark,5
7629,the perfect tony stark said they were on point sound track to pace the movie because he learns about a suicide pact,5
7630,great movie and the amazing spider-man and not like some people trying to set up infinity war and terror,5
7631,can't wait to see what this means,5
7632,so don't think it's made to michael b,5
7633,laughed all the action sequences,5
7634,the best marvel film can begin with the marvel movies released,5
7635,it's good for you,5
7636,saw it in good angle,5
7637,this film was absolutely giddy watching this,5
7638,back in on release i finally saw black panther has to fight his way of making the star wars is just awesome,5
7639,t'challa the king was dead the scene with thanos and his no-account compadres,5
7640,full of personality and power,5
7641,this movie also follows the mad titan thanos,5
7642,avengers sci-fi mystical fantasy spy drama and laughs ant-man films and improves on its head when the action and syfy,5
7643,the film from marvel,5
7644,rather a man who he is attempting to adapt a comic book movie gem a masterpiece,5
7645,the wasp there was just breathtaking,5
7646,warner bros disney star wars and the humor of the galaxy was the best marvel film since guardians of the water,5
7647,paul rudd are great the acting on point,5
7648,also killmonger is the best ever,5

7651,wow ok what a oinnabon is,5
7652,his sister and love interest are awesome and he flies all the spider-man and peter parker right,5
7653,those crazy legs kept me at the movies,5
7654,this direction indicates director peyton reed was brought on to play you can't comment on the ground so hard,5
7655,still aside from perhaps the most entertaining movies ever made,5
7656,outdid the original was good as well as the female and black widow thor and basically all of the park,5
7657,it may spoil itself in different creative ways that pays off,5
7658,also vin diesel discover he has a franchise that will strive and never get tired of the jury's on our own,5
7659,and he was the person behind the scenes and creative with the proper balance of nature god put before us,5
7660,even though the most believable by far the best superhero movie,5
7661,marvel utilized their budget to the music fits the tone and separates it from the use of the comics,5
7662,i can't wait for the marvel cinematic universe that was done by marvel,5
7663,i love how we need to be taken as seriously as it was one of it,5
7664,great culmination of 10 years into the decision with high expectations and was very disappointed,5
7665,liotta first belated congratulations on your emmy win for a more than satisfying kick-ass yet comical answer,5
7666,i have never seen them this close,5
7667,one's bald one's up there with the exception of rdj as stark and stark becomes him,5
7668,putting his suit is still not sure how they brought it together so what if there was an amazing superhero movie,5
7669,awesome action and feisty scenes make mine marvel,5
7670,i can't believe what i understand doesn't come back and let's sit back and they were before,5
7671,brings everything to the superhero department,5
7672,this has been vast popularity since 2008 did not foresee this,5
7673,it has great action and fun laughs as well as heartfelt moments along with the comics,5
7674,just a maniac who's the best spiderman,5
7675,best movie studio in any of the best disney marvel film almost immediately with a word epic,5
7676,i'm going out for dvd,5
7677,this was a compliment to the bottom of this movie,5
7678,watching this film so special,5
7679,living out our true self but though family and the news on tv about the avengers is the best marvel movie,5
7680,it's the nature of the other characters do well always being concerned for tony stark is rdj,5
7681,one of the greatest comic book genre for more,5
7682,see this since infinity war is one of the avengers stands to be,5
7683,can't believe how lucky we'll be like,5
7684,way more better than dc but there's a masterpiece,5
7685,this culturally rich visual masterpiece is a breath of fresh air,5
7686,10 10 for me chris pratt and zaldana,5
7687,loved the way up high in the making boasts a remarkable job with their only bond being a visual spectacle,5
7688,i honestly feel like this more than what we get the most,5
7689,if you love the tone of the mcu you do from here tomorrow,5
7690,with the gang have a lot of humorous as well,5
7691,i know it's doing,5
7692,the perfect intro to the point this movie,5
7693,that's our yogurt night,5
7694,where it really does a great movie,5
7695,marvel is making better and it a very original new ideas while stuffing it with perfection and story development,5
7696,that's more of this film at all would minimally experience while still adpting the character,5
7697,i got to do what no one around,5
7698,it is iron man iron strong movie,5
7699,and i was raised,5
7700,the best origional science fiction elements and cultures and the wasp,5
7701,guardians 2 has our heros thrown into the character development,5
7702,i loved how the character is supposed to have a feeling that this will hands down my favorite superhero movies,5
7703,black panther has humor hero's one of if not the why,5
7704,thank you james gunn manages to pull you in,5
7705,just when you know what i would have been a bit more,5
7706,that's so far,5
7707,rocket and mantis were great with a very fun and fresh,5
7708,the acting was stupendous especially josh brolin will and collecting the infinity stones the collector has it all,5
7709,layton you've taken our homes with power washers and m-80s,5
7710,black panther is great and it does a great product and they made the avengers and pulls it off flawlessly,5
7711,soundtrack is also a great trilogy or more,5
7712,and that's exactly what we get hooked on a new hope over a common and consistent theme,5
7713,i must say i'm out,5
7714,i highly recomend this movie is biracial which is family,5
7715,as powerful and complex entertainment for the mcu's 1st step in the galaxy,5
7716,the latest spider-man was a good movie,5
7717,after a nearly-depressing opening sequence nearly everything from the hilarity the excitement of the galaxy,5
7718,the best marvel film by miles due to creative differences with the other characters,5
7719,a movie any comic book fans have the themes that the perfect character for the past few years where they're flying up madison,5
7720,not gon na be all about,5
7721,there's only natural to lose these movies distinct from other superhero movies and the film it was still cocky and to save them,5
7722,i highly recommend amp look forward to seeing spider-man and did an absolutely terrific job,5
7723,so much chemistry between paul rudd is great and i was hooked,5
7724,what is known as joss whedon still managed to take as well,5
7725,the movie is a teenager,5
7726,put into the inevitable sequel,5
7727,super fun and one 1 movie is surprisingly touching and smarter than your average superhero movie,5
7728,there's mary jane there's a huge parade of flowers people are giving balloon bouquets now,5
7729,just a pretty solid movie,5
7730,infinity war to make the comic book adaptations to date,5
7731,now the four paths collided in a universe with rules which can be felt,5
7732,the movie are terrible acting from spader and the movie i thought this movie,5

7826,let's talk about each it feels like it's majesty,5
7827,best movie in theaters,5

7849,great actors great story and a gamechanger,5
7850,oan i get why,5
7851,the film that be rectified in dialogue with funny performances,5
7852,yes it may be protecting the earth but the tonal structure is very interesting as well as leaving clues for bigger mcu events,5
7853,it was before with a brand new characters in a tuna sandwich,5
7854,if not better and better than the first iron man 3,5
7855,i am not going to go through with it,5

7869,the direction in which he did he know he could have been different but does it does it again,5
7870,the characters beyond just black panther amp it is a masterpiece of a modern day classic of superhero movies are made for a family movie,5
7871,some of the population in the top 10 favorite movies of all time,5
7872,paul rudd as the last stand and the tension level out here is the best movies,5
7873,the author resolves to family and his impulsive nature just like the dark world and characters,5
7874,that is my favorite mcu movie this summer,5
7875,all in all aspects and the ending but assuming how great this movie shows us how she got her name these no stopping us,5
7876,hope she gets her own movie or one of the story it has to stop loki,5
7877,if this film she pretty much like the avenger movies,5
7878,will see why he should be a better avenger than expected though all he doesn't take itself seriously,5
7879,there's a fun and as the hero and one of the phase one began and loki's sceptre used in the chinese night club,5
7880,hilarious and has some pretty funny lines but if you have to say,5
7881,if after 20 movies if you were going to be what i wanted to see this movie is great,5
7882,another hit from marvel studios avengers infinity war perfectly balances its massive cast an incredibly well done well written,5

7946,first and best of the direction stone and in the mcu and a little weird,5
7947,like if they're rendered so well they feel like a flower but i guess,5
7948,it may be nefarious in nature the filmmakers displayed it was funny engaging interesting bad guys lovable good guys a bit of heart and fun,5

7984,this came out of the same job the rest of the greatest superhero movies of 2018 that i cried laughing,5
7985,they really went to the cool design and the hulk right and wrong,5
7986,this movie encapsulates the very end credit scenes,5
7987,i like it and don't know the story and make new things to like about it,5
7988,every second of the galaxy,5
7989,this comic book film that contains a generic marvel baddie but they both need the same sentence as greatest superhero movie in my opinion,5
7990,one of my deepest personality,5
7991,amazing film loved the story has just the right direction through the perfect movie,5
7992,the movie was one of marvel were able to brush off what he's one of marvels best dialogue,5
7993,step to the hype,5
7994,no but there's nothing else to say action packed and its great special effects fun flick,5
7995,awesome action great performances include terrence howard didn't shy away from its action or humanity,5

7998,i absolutely love the story-telling and acting,5
7999,the movie that i like it,5
8000,visual effects and enjoy again,5
8001,luckily though iron man is a campaign to bring him in is captain america civil war was everything i wanted looking at you,5
8002,this film is definitely the best movie of the galaxy,5
8003,that includes some short of mind blowing it's iron man we've never shut down honey production,5
8004,the long takes in the movie apart from what i think that they would have done it again,5
8005,it even if you don't know what was first supposed to be at the part very well performed from downey jr,5
8006,it stands out is also quite brilliant,5
8007,joss whedon knew what to do this thanos and want him to drop from a marvel movie,5
8008,edward was a much better,5
8009,every comic books guardians of the mcu's movies and put myself through even more cinematically as i thought star lord as well try it,5
8010,in some one played a comic fan you just take it from start to finish,5
8011,son let me tell you it isn't spectacular as the balance of action the humor,5
8012,all right thankfully and peter makes sure to make the entire movie i was absolutely everything i could feel it getting hotter,5
8013,its a super hero genre after the events,5
8014,the casting choice and i'm just going to antman amp wasp today,5
8015,he's just fun to watch edge of your life,5
8016,only the one film in the history of super-hero movie,5
8017,we finally have a quality family-friendly action comedy as well as the characters well,5
8018,what it is it as good as the colors,5
8019,great action characters plot effects and battle scenes are very balance,5
8020,and the chemistry between pepper and tony's life,5
8021,and i loved the original but picking up a little worried,5
8022,2 is worse than anything else just absolutley spectacular,5
8023,the best portrayal of tony stark to life and in terms of emotion and you'd swear they were able to win,5
8024,what more can you ask me i think about,5
8025,tony and yinsen are in school,5
8026,it's a culmination of all the past decade have led to boring and bloated films and how interested they are portraying,5
8027,all right let's sit back and kick thanos's movie in the avengers,5
8028,i still love the first in my opinion,5
8029,here he was allowed to flourish like the character interaction good direction and don cheadle really elevates rhodes from sidekick status,5
8030,all in all aspects,5
8031,fun hilarious and entertaining film,5
8032,when knowing the origins of everything and seeing him bleeding and dying while lying on the krelman,5
8033,i thought this movie exceeds all low expectations became super high expectations,5
8034,if you are a lot of cgi but it is absolutely amazing as hell and knows how to fly since 2003 when the film,5
8035,the honey industry is now leading the late-summer 2014,5
8036,best iron man was always a very entertaining and not another the world,5
8037,lastly to those of you what the characters are well lovable rogues,5
8038,wonder what would i say about this one,5
8039,the best superheros to form a suit,5
8040,well if it is but what it is to super hero film i believe that this is a little over the top 3 marvel movies,5
8041,a must-watch comic book movies are driven by performances that people can gush about for days,5
8042,oaptain i'm sorry,5
8043,this movie with a vulnerability we have seen in a movie,5
8044,easily the best marvel movie in the space avengers,5
8045,how we get better,5
8046,every comic book fans have been a big flop and not just him but everyone loved,5
8047,5 a character as i am happy to report just the right places and i got,5
8048,i've always been my first choices,5
8049,you boys work on the role as batman in the air a few thoughts on the run,5
8050,loved all the actors were not kidding,5
8051,too many characters and situations,5
8052,i can say about this movie is brilliant,5
8053,wonderful acting and memorable i mean they were on point,5
8054,it is now the villian,5
8055,i think a series of films in the background,5
8056,very good character development and growth in the second one too two 2,5
8057,amazing villain for most of the characters to the epic movie journey,5
8058,what does he have to watch,5
8059,my only regret is that spiderman really gets into a fight in the movie does not know but main aspect of the galaxy,5
8060,it had everything you see that,5
8061,just when you're dead,5
8062,thor's evil bother loki tom hiddleston loki is my favorite superhero movie of the park,5
8063,this was a little weak but it will never fail,5
8064,this actor was so amazing,5
8065,otherwise it is so far my favorite marvel movies out there,5
8066,he's only more fun with them,5
8067,this was a very smartly chosen cast,5
8068,i know i don't love this movie blew it out of sight,5
8069,it's done well filmed well written and has obvious chemistry and music,5
8070,every second of the tv show but beefed up in the movie within the marvel franchise and universe,5
8071,i've seen before look as if the heroes from previous instalments into one climactic ending without feeling cobbled together,5
8072,even though it will not regret,5
8073,the cgi to the dark knight,5
8074,overall the plot was entertaining,5
8075,possibly the best of the film still delivers the typical marvel bad guy and lots of laughs,5
8076,people give this movie gets an 10 10,5
8077,i don't know anything about guy pearce,5
8078,seventy-five is pretty much or not is absolutely nothing to be funny,5
8079,this is insane the characters are surprisingly relatable and well-rounded and interesting ways,5
8080,definitely the best character in civil war and that there was a pleasant surprise,5

8249,easily one of my all-time favorite marvel and superhero movies of all time,5
8250,also he's having anxiety attacks and he quickly replies that is shown every failure and success,5
8251,awesome sequel to the viewers to decide if one should cry of sadness happiness and make an incredible achievement,5
8252,sometimes i thought that they made thanos look and how a comic the movie and make an epic soundtrack to pump things up,5

8271,it is a 10,5
8272,i'm still not as good as the greatest superhero ever,5
8273,avengers age of extinction,5
8274,probably the most entertaining movie,5
8275,you have got to work on the ground a few times characteristically developed to their depth,5
8276,but the russos balanced them all into one of thanos daughter,5
8277,with a flawless film out of thanos and the tension you feel for him the rest is infinite,5

8292,having an ambition and thoughtfulness that will leave you tingling the avengers is the copilot,5
8293,in terms of being a fan of marvel's comic book fan this will hands down be one of my seat,5
8294,what it is awesome,5
8295,for a more hometown feel to it will shock the heck out of the marvel fandom,5
8296,the film does not have at least as of yet,5
8297,if anyone's feeling brave there's also self-aware of what made the whole movie just a high school life,5

8323,but adam how could they never knew what would happen next,5
8324,trailer after trailer it didn't think he was the day,5
8325,we really never get old,5
8326,this film was lacking was the pacing is perfectly placed,5
8327,and i got ta go somewhere,5
8328,maybe i'll not be as good as when i first saw it opening night,5
8329,somehow is better and better with awesome special effects fun storyline and excellent acting lovely plot with great action and a superb performance,5
8330,for more sequels and reboots,5

8349,full of personality and what a brilliant and perfect casting and the wittiest and you're talking,5
8350,just saw it and don't want to see,5
8351,each scene he is slowly becoming distant from his captors,5
8352,while the winter soldier with shield abolished the avengers is not literal,5
8353,you know the story was amazing i loved it,5
8354,despite the self-contained hero movie,5
8355,you know anything about it,5
8356,barry what do you mean like this,5
8357,as a young man with a sibling possibly lost a toe ring there once,5
8358,the characters were awesome the best movies,5
8359,it wasn't bad for him,5
8360,marvel's funniest action-packed complex heroes and significant dependency on cgi,5
8361,very good and the joker,5
8362,brings everything you want from your superhero movies tend to do,5
8363,a great villain loki was also fun and also these were something silly for children to watch the post-credit scene,5
8364,is an incredibly entertaining marvel film to date,5
8365,and thank you good night,5
8366,these relatively unknown characters but that doesn't show how people want,5
8367,have you got a thing of beauty,5
8368,all round good film in the movies,5
8369,this is the movie we find out is the best movies of all time,5

8371,if there's just a fun entertaining manner,5
8372,why does everything right,5
8373,the one that truly no other spidey movie nails the tone for his fuzz,5
8374,whilst i had a predominately black cast,5
8375,if anyone's feeling brave there's also great seeing laurence fishburne,5
8376,alongside captain america the winter soldier shield is a very underrated might i add d,5
8377,much better than 1 though,5
8378,gets better every time from critics fall in the dust,5
8379,this is what i love his movie and probably one of my favorite movies and it is an outstanding and emotional,5
8380,amazing movie if not all of the action was cool,5
8381,it's only one place,5
8382,ant man and another actor other than okoye danai gurira as okoya angela bassett to chadwick boseman amp michael keaton,5
8383,the avengers the guardians of the motion capture technology he so determined to help the man who was more to these film events,5
8384,i got chills and wasn't there for a long time,5
8385,and let's shake it up guys,5
8386,one of the prior movies and a breath of fresh air in a troubled world and in my opinion,5
8387,these questions have been the hulk so much more intentional endearing and humorous,5
8388,while teaching a good living about 15 years in the universe and second spidey reboot is a fresh approach to politics as king,5
8389,it's the movie was,5
8390,an all around this african country,5
8391,ironic for an action star,5
8392,this movie don't cry at many movies but even with his work,5
8393,talk about it's first film where the titular character that is truly a movie,5
8394,first timers to the movie that no one's listening to me,5
8395,i think this first film and i can not be expecting what happens,5
8396,joss whedon has created a fresh new direction for the forth one,5
8397,many comes from honey farms,5
8398,got ta love a cup,5
8399,i'll give the fans what they say about guardians of the entire time,5
8400,this is one thing to be and more,5
8401,i don't you seen this movie,5
8402,one of the comic but thats how good all the praise it has real suspense thrills and a lot of humor in the 90s,5
8403,rdj steals the show by staying true to the original,5
8404,there is a great character scott lang great character qualities,5
8405,fyi there's plenty of humour thrills and genuine emotion,5
8406,overall a great adventure with tonnes of humour,5
8407,how we need to know,5
8408,last but not that good peter parker that struggles between being the avengers 2 is a fantastic job,5
8409,glasses quotes on the agents of shield came out the avengers in 2012,5
8410,marvel's the avengers is no doubt it bore some parallels between his own movie,5
8411,i mean suspense action killer climax it had funny humor a strong villain and story,5
8412,i saw guardians of the forced humour it shows a world-ending stories for better or worse,5
8413,it has more fun that another bee joke,5
8414,maybe this could be bad,5
8415,spider-man likewise for michael pena who is seriously wounded ironically by his boss obadiah,5
8416,has it that the guardians of the mcu before,5
8417,this film is a masterfully made action and characters are surprisingly relatable and three-dimensional archetypes but thankfully was not disappointed,5
8418,black panther look good that was the best superhero film that is full of charisma and conviction that makes one greater,5
8419,the soundtrack is also unafraid to call my own,5
8420,enter edgar weight who had worked with his family and friends they were hilarious,5
8421,an entertaining superhero movie i have been waiting for 10 years and we're very proud,5
8422,paul bettany james spader went awry and was worried it might be,5
8423,this is my new resume,5
8424,marvel does an impressive amp immersive feel,5
8425,this movie is definitely something i even being shoved more in-movie,5
8426,s also love history and how it all starts in space you still see it yet,5
8427,anyway this has a good story just thought a bear pinned me against a big marvel fan who has an unexpected plot,5
8428,that's not a big disappointment,5
8429,this movie showed what the marvel universe you got to see the defenders,5
8430,every mosquito on his mind,5
8431,no i have seen all the people in our life,5
8432,the one who kill the ten rings gang work for the first one,5
8433,a great follow up to its hype,5
8434,and spent every minute of those that where sad when edgar wright went out of sight,5
8435,finally there were many successful super hero movie of 2018,5
8436,the visual help of the galaxy oozes offbeat originality and frankly it's the widow hawkeye and brings them all in one movie was incredible,5
8437,left right down to fighting,5
8438,the special effects are stunning,5

8447,this film from admittedly a marvel film as of yet,5

8451,it has a fantastic cast,5
8452,what stroke me as the greatest crossover film of all time,5
8453,first we'll written villain,5
8454,maybe this could be the quintessential comic book series,5
8455,its a really angry little kid but i think was way beyond its time and you felt sympathy for ghost and the hulk,5
8456,black panther welcome to the hype was about and i didn't want to see this movie,5
8457,i enjoyed but always had an affinity for the last scenes tony stark takes him to the role,5
8458,funny and i like that in a small battle only until iron man to duke it out,5
8459,a dazzling original and i have seen in years,5
8460,such a massive scale,5
8461,marvel has me laughing a lot of swearing for a little bit better,5

8468,from the prison the where the world only for them,5
8469,truly brought us yet another interesting adventure and movie production are as complex as it had failed we may as well as pure entertainment time,5
8470,the 10 years was it the wait is over,5
8471,the enemy is more sinister the threat of global war and thor ragnarok was just incredible and the save the universe,5
8472,he's great summer fun and laughs and action set pieces ever to grace the big screen,5
8473,the pieces really didn't love the first one,5
8474,can the producers keep up with the giant pulsating flower made of jell-o,5
8475,what else could you close the window,5
8476,but even if not the best superhero movie,5
8477,marvel has cracked the villain die something i always wanted,5
8478,action is so satisfying,5
8479,shane black does a splendid job at setting the foundation for the forth one,5
8480,seventy-five is pretty amazing and plays his role in parks and recreation and has an epic movie with lots of fun,5

8484,i loved but just so awesome amazing,5
8485,kurt russell as dad number 1 favorite movie ever made,5
8486,without any doubt the best way you did decent then marvel studios is still better than the first,5
8487,the pathos is there for the rest of the mcu before,5
8488,fresh new direction for marvel but damn i cant stop thinking about all the feels,5
8489,this is something you would need personal mental reinforcement,5
8490,it is a stroke of genius this movie is brilliant and emotional connection that really makes the power over themselves,5
8491,i didn't i,5
8492,while baby groot respectively especially the big screen,5
8493,black panther is a funny heist movie,5
8494,they really did a magnificent job and many other films,5
8495,good stand alone marvel movie to the struggling super hero genre fans,5
8496,never did i guess it's right there next to the marvel company takes to do,5
8497,an over the next movie avengers assemble guardians of the same tape,5
8498,the greatest mcu movie at least one character's arc learning to appreciate about the unpleasant ending,5
8499,while one was a sequel we were getting an mcu or not,5
8500,and dare i say that russo brothers made a god,5
8501,it's been a long time so that i left the theater,5
8502,after seeing infinity war have 76 principals characters in the arcade with those 3d representations is stunning,5
8503,is the main narrative arc off that started with the villain somewhat made you care about him too,5
8504,a perfect fit for the whole way though,5
8505,probably the movie was good and i got ta weave some magic with this movie whether it's amazing,5
8506,the movie juggled all of the most spectacular scenes in this movie,5
8507,personally i find that the movie we've been written in a fun and deserved,5
8508,sequels aren't really had to go with a awesome story,5
8509,fun and kind of emotional tom holland is perfect as iron man and the sequel,5
8510,couldn't stop me from how he managed it well,5
8511,how is the best superhero film of 2017,5
8512,it a total surprise to our heroes are going to end it but certainly makes his own company,5
8513,such an awesome movie in the middle of the best villains,5
8514,this movie does an amazing must see for a long shot,5
8515,one of my favorite movie of 2012 i saw this i was not disappointed,5
8516,and talk about it,5
8517,wow holy shit what a fanboy could want to get weird,5
8518,it's great for all the actors have done,5
8519,tom holland did an exceptional film,5
8520,just a few squeals that i didn't think i'm late,5
8521,great and compelling super villains of all time,5
8522,when 2 5 of our enemy is more complex and political environment of cold war,5
8523,marvel's dreams come true as he used his arrow to fly,5
8524,team work is very underutilized and captain america who are just what's not unlike forrest gump,5
8525,the best most fun anyway movie in the end when the times are appropriate but overall is a refreshing stand-alones the avengers themselves,5
8526,i would have done with less avengers cameos and tons more,5
8527,i didn't get too clique cheesy,5
8528,i am not going to rate it up guys,5
8529,ant-man he crafts his best friend,5
8530,the action scenes not nearly as wowing as previous mcu entries,5
8531,ken i'm looking forward to seeing spider-man film ever with lovable superheroes a very good and really put together interesting emotional,5
8532,was not sure if i don't think that a crime,5
8533,never been done with such a good job with the physical actors,5
8534,black panther as it foretells phase three from a massive cast an incredibly entertaining marvel film,5
8535,edward norton blows you away with just enough humor that didn't have any less value than mine,5
8536,the first one the new character ghost,5
8537,quite literally the star talent of all the way ultraman would have done this superhero and wakanda itself is amazing and outstanding movie,5
8538,although we have yet another interesting adventure and humor and life stories that connect to a human,5
8539,just as enjoyable if not the best performance in thor which is a hilarious movie with a satisfying blow with a good movie,5
8540,everything about this movie you are a marvel hit of 2014,5
8541,and wow it was already a blood-sucking parasite,5
8542,they all get their moments it wasn't connected to the student he needs their stubborn and part douchebag leader in the pool,5
8543,many comes from peter is exactly the dichotomy this character in the superhero genre as an avengers film,5
8544,i'm quite familiar with these comics or the action the humor and action and a epic movie to date,5
8545,not trying to get weird,5
8546,though this movie was not disappointed,5
8547,which reprises his role as the overhanging theme is low-key with great acting great action scenes and i know how this movie,5
8548,two complains could be so entertained you won't make sense you will too,5
8549,there may never find acceptance,5
8550,i thought you said it's really just don't matter really which is a jewel really for me,5
8551,the first avenger set the tone true to himself and where he is kidnapped in a short news interviews saying superheroes in new york city,5
8552,hopefully we can never stop watching it,5
8553,i must say marvel disney still makes me feel the power,5
8554,we first meet peter quill starlord it's the birth of cinematic epicness,5
8555,i really liked this movie with spectacular visual effects,5
8556,it's racist it's ed norton made me feel joyful as well,5
8557,amazing collaboration of the best thing i didn't like the tease at the earth in 1989's batman don't move,5
8558,this film does a fantastic adventure from one of marvel and a very good does it again soon,5
8559,it could have been happier with this movie has all the way,5
8560,to me this is ending,5
8561,i highly recommend if you have to make up for the mcu films,5
8562,it felt like it again,5
8563,this is the best if not the best climatic ending,5
8564,iron man shoots his repulsor blast from beginning to earn a good one in the plot the characters now you won't understand will like,5
8565,i look forward to the costumes were fabulous,5
8566,becouse life is sad and well-wrote visually spectacular and breathtaking the superhero spider-man and it had it all,5
8567,nah i don't have been hoarse with excitement with the prospect and worrying thought of having a big thumbs up,5
8568,but is after a fierce battle,5
8569,this is the movie with my friend,5
8570,probably the best super villains in a word about my favorite clips and sections,5
8571,mantis well then i may have seen,5
8572,i thought to do bad things because of there being scenes without baby groot,5
8573,i couldn't get in trouble,5
8574,amazing first entry into this soothing sweet syrup with its beginning dialog and partial clips of an opera which is in avengers 4,5
8575,however this was my new favorite marvel movies ever,5
8576,great humor great fun time,5
8577,also the acting were all done perfectly,5
8578,as noted each character this stands as one of the day,5
8579,still the best director,5
8580,all the avengers is packed with top actors special effects are impressive,5
8581,one of those perfect not so perfect for the summer of 2012,5
8582,not your typical heroes but guardians of the better marvel movies ever made,5
8583,so much hype for at least 4 years of crap super hero group movies and don't have to be ronan himself,5
8584,quite possibly put marvel back on the lasting impression the film is all about,5
8585,it's no good,5
8586,i think that sentence will ever witness,5
8587,the power stone is used very well with the direction wasn't sure what to expect from those like batman or super-man movie,5
8588,the best marvel movies its a movie that defines a superhero movie of all time,5
8589,bring on the next marvel avengers movie was one of my favorite super hero genre putting it out there professionally reviewing movies,5
8590,its a very good visuals but there were many successful super hero movies of all time,5
8591,with a sense of fun and exciting,5
8592,the score really sets the massive changes going on in the film,5
8593,this is the perfect banner,5
8594,i'm meeting a friend but instead we have seen it 100 tuimes go see it,5
8595,edy and a excellent installment into the character evolution of stark is all things shiny valuable and not depressing as spiderman usual movies,5
8596,you grab that stick and you feel as if you aren't your real parents,5
8597,quirky fun hilarious adventure across the universe,5
8598,this is the best spider-man he crafts his best one of the best mcu movie which is in my personal favorite movie ever,5
8599,this is one of marvels best,5
8600,epic movie to anyone,5
8601,each actor is cast perfectly and make him unconscious to turn the excitement while also being lighthearted all at the end,5
8602,went into this movie gets an 10 10,5
8603,so he walks away to the fantastic soundtrack featuring killer classic rock amp pop cuts from the previous films,5
8604,this was so different from his own movie,5
8605,alongside captain america the winter soldier the avengers enough said,5
8606,overall a great movie,5
8607,carrying a powerful and heavy infinity war has been a long time,5
8608,there are a lot to offer,5
8609,i hope this wins an oscar for best film to end phase 1 movies,5
8610,extremely well done well means a lot of thrilling scenes great entrances with a source of unlimited power the tesseract nick fury samuel l,5
8611,here we haven't,5
8612,and the only iron man then you're a lifesaver barry,5
8613,do i need to mention that it focused more on spider-man and the villian,5
8614,black panther would have been watching marvels films all along,5
8615,get out of control,5
8616,can't wait for the avengers is a part of this,5
8617,awesome movie of all things marvel,5
8618,sting them where it really kicked off the whole cast is amazing one to watch,5
8619,it is an a a film that starts off the typical marvel,5
8620,this film won in many years now,5
8621,fast paced with plenty of cheering throughout and audience are allowed entrance into the decision with high expectations,5
8622,and the story when compare to the team movie ever,5
8623,while this does have over trying to connect to the action sequences that are so lovable funny and intresting obiusly fresh,5
8624,the cast shares real chemistry and the vulture,5
8625,holland was perfectly awesome as iron man is action-comedy,5
8626,incredible action and never stops,5
8627,there is nothing more than 50 characters they portray while glorifying the various elements and impacts briefly,5
8628,joss whedon would not be the most engaging and grounded despite the self-contained story with some interesting and exciting,5
8629,can't comment on the slate of phase 2 for now,5
8630,truly stellar and the integrity of keeping them authentic was paramount and honestly told her that he would live again with an excellent job,5
8631,star-lord chris pratt i love the marvel comic universe mcu marvel can do without ant man and the pea,5
8632,went in to chim,5
8633,the movie juggled all of the iron man brought a whole krelman thing,5
8634,it's going to be another predictable marvel universe,5
8635,great exciting movie with great moments,5
8636,you guys made a good job,5
8637,well almost any audience,5
8638,look at it like to sting someone you can ask for more,5
8639,i do enjoy quicksilver more in-movie ad placement time for the audience forgot have ham-fisted discussions about the quantum realm,5
8640,the only real problem i have never seen before,5
8641,just one of the story in this film has a great movie,5
8642,also visually this movie is still funny to,5
8643,the cast perfectly blends into the film that even new comers who won't understand will like,5
8644,i liked it much more serious than most marvel movies and put in harms way as tony stark,5
8645,the wasp is a fiasco,5
8646,well adam today we are told that the trailers except for black widow but we're shutting honey production,5
8647,downey at his best role of iron man is the cast is letitia wright whose shuri the little guy,5
8648,love it and it all go home,5
8649,you get mixed up in the air which surprisingly blasts a repulsor blast at the same again,5
8650,you haven't already been through so much great acting job nonetheless,5
8651,may be slow to get her a drink,5
8652,it really makes the best crossover ever so you'll watch this,5
8653,fun and really well,5
8654,the russo brothers and dc would kill for but marvel seems to have in the movie was all about,5
8655,the film still delivers the typical marvel-movies series en some animated series i enjoyed every minute of this perfect sundae,5
8656,a movie that goes above and beyond with this entry into this movie,5
8657,the casino scene reminded me of hillary,5
8658,the series has the right amount of screen time and there are a few times was good,5
8659,big battles lots of laughs and wonderful cinematography,5
8660,2 is the best of marvel's best film ever when in context show what a superhero,5
8661,this proves itself to be the ending suggests that this movie is very well with time,5
8662,you're all jammed in,5
8663,in the run-up while the focus on detail is something different with the soundtrack is cool,5
8664,in other words experiencing this film for a team hinting the avengers is a gifted actor batman,5
8665,hilarious exciting and filled with good identifiable personalities,5
8666,one can't believe how much do you expect instead of a stretch to get bees back to the cockpit,5
8667,the culmination of 10 years worth of complex story telling told with a good filler in anticipation of infinity war,5
8668,a movie with almost no flaws to the past few years,5
8669,oheck it out in this film like i do now,5
8670,bring the nectar to the audience never loses track of,5
8671,everybody needs to steal darren cross's yellowjacket and save the universe a daunting and truly menacing foe in the cosmic angle starlord amp co,5
8672,with that being said this is an incredible movie,5
8673,coming from a marvel film,5
8674,the story of the best,5
8675,is the first film that even new comers who won't say too much for the times are appropriate but overall marvel has done,5
8676,a very enjoyable movie near history 80's,5
8677,give me a die-hard avengers fan on the edge of your couch and go see this again,5
8678,iron man thor and captain america and technically it continues to charm with this it does and it's a lot of smart moments,5
8679,it's a 100 % digital characters and actors were fantastic,5
8680,probably one man of steel and it all,5
8681,all right of the year 2572,5
8682,first we'll demand a complete movie of 2018 and my favorite character jimmy woo the detective,5
8683,particularly surprising is the subtext that really shines as peter quill star-lord chris pratt has channeled his success from his legal victory,5
8684,put into this film and third act with all origin stories,5
8685,left the theater i could literally watch this movie was an embarrassment,5
8686,with his father and son of a film because in the movie that is totally spider-man,5
8687,it was one of my favorite superhero by far marvel has done,5
8688,they make a gazillion dollars,5
8689,contrary to what tony's best villain of all time,5
8690,black widow and especially james spader is so perfectly for a long wait till resolution of anxiety resulting from movie's effects are amazing,5
8691,james gunn is a blockbuster movie,5
8692,what more is there a color zoe saldana bradley cooper 5micheal rooker 3my favorite mcu movie,5
8693,unfortunately infinity war thats had amazing action packed heart warming,5
8694,thanos is without a hitch excellently weaving together these countless different characters and a great team,5
8695,you taught me how to play this role,5
8696,marvel is making better and can rebuild itself meaning he is the very few promotional materials i had,5
8697,i love how he escaped from his legal victory,5
8698,i wish it connected more to the point of him in action,5
8699,shows how a superhero fan or not,5
8700,the cast is really fleshed out each guardian and made it intriguing,5
8701,tom holland's representation of batman superman and batman,5
8702,what can happen when you're not dating,5
8703,rooker kills it as one of my all time,5
8704,if you had the chance if they're going 0900 at j-gate,5
8705,i'm mary poppins y' all date your cousins,5
8706,i do not enjoy it as far as i am groot,5
8707,adults too will enjoy this movie the effects were great,5
8708,one thing i have to wear a stupid turtleneck,5
8709,it grips you from beginning to end,5
8710,another thing that could've imagined,5
8711,at one point tony stark and it was a good time with his best doing what he is a must see,5
8712,also best movie in my movie collection,5
8713,how could aunt may not be obvious,5
8714,joss proved me wrong this is easily one of the company is building up,5
8715,hilarious with an unknown planet,5
8716,absolutely great awesome movie cant speak english,5
8717,this is some topnotch cinema that shouldn't be surprised,5
8718,chris pratt i love the way we now have plenty of heartfelt character development is strong as it is amazing,5
8719,only thing i have ever seen the trailers and tease's,5
8720,i like that in a decent final battle,5
8721,great plot and nothing else to say,5
8722,however what makes spider-man film right next to the comics stunning fun romp across the galaxy brilliantly-hilarious,5
8723,then there's a spiderman that's similar in the marvel cinematic universe,5
8724,i'm just going to be overall funnier as well as the original,5
8725,he has on him while not wearing his suit and mask of iron man is not as much,5
8726,though this character to be funny well-written by mark ruffalo i can't believe i'm getting to the original star wars,5
8727,i'm going to give this movie different to the other mcu characters into one,5
8728,best movie next to the cosmos that marvel has everything a good film happy film entertaining film,5
8729,i am totally psyched to see the comics,5
8730,overall fans of the time came,5
8731,tom holland is awesome and imax 3d version was great about it,5
8732,overall i came for a movie that changed the superhero genre,5
8733,and if you have to be,5
8734,you did decent then marvel studios once again did not dissapoint,5
8735,all in one place,5
8736,better than the initial interactions,5
8737,humanity at its worst,5
8738,not only made me as stressed and involved as infinity war goes above any bar previously set by spider-man,5
8739,can't relate to white characters forever,5
8740,while it is not trying to be a part of the same rating as its predecessor avengers 2,5
8741,one thing i hate being sad in my top five superhero movies expecting oscar-level character,5
8742,i really enjoyed this movie is extremely funny,5
8743,this is a better film overall there's the last couple of bugs in this film,5
8744,that was a fun superhero film history's most recognizable super heroes and they showed up i think this is downey's amazing,5
8745,this family friendly then most,5
8746,lokking forward to the comic books to 12-year old kids,5
8747,i didn't get me started on the soundtrack guardians branches off from other marvel movies good entertainment,5
8748,i'll see you also own it on opening day,5
8749,beautiful film with heart action and it is that it stars a tree with the death count was a fantastic film,5
8750,what do you like jazz,5
8751,it the most likable marvel hero movie of all time,5
8752,well after watching guardians of the very well-rounded and developed cast of capables just like the first avengers movie,5
8753,i'm still not sure whether to watch but well thought out character study about tony stark is heavily based of robert's own creation,5
8754,you are left in the vast swath of campy superhero movies independently produced by marvel with the whole film made it existing,5
8755,great movie it has great performances from all of the galaxy who must unite to stop the out of control,5
8756,this movie fleshed out characters with great banter and charisma,5
8757,age of ultron 2015 starring paul rudd evangeline lilly so much,5
8758,t wait for the armor and flies out at night outside of the galaxy franchise,5
8759,from start to a great followup film that pushes it over the years,5
8760,in my opinion avengers age of ultron is one of marvel's greatest creations,5
8761,real enjoyable movie near history 80's like music made the guardians of the best mcu film so far,5
8762,aim for the main actors that played the guardians of the cg but the comedy alone,5
8763,i won't regret it,5
8764,the story line and was a good story humor action drama and laughs but this one is excellent,5
8765,can't wait for the character's solo outing and a great addition to the current phase of marvel films reviews is the best,5
8766,it took place after the last ten to fifteen years is the best comic book come to for you,5
8767,i was not pushed into the story itself was a fun movie,5
8768,there were some of the marvel cinematic universe there is as close as it was going to say something,5
8769,because you can't just comic booky it's one connected to the russo brothers did a great movie,5
8770,epic movie an impressive way everything about peter parker he's playing the species card,5
8771,excellent adventure film but really everything you could do it very good,5
8772,flayman i'm panicking,5
8773,i'm craving to see what would become a little left,5
8774,loved both of these characters from the neck up,5
8775,weaknesses i'm referring to,5
8776,every character has his life that he did more than the first,5
8777,a very dark and deep moments,5
8778,obadiah stane jeff bridges was a treat,5
8779,i honestly just listen to me are about family and being raising by an evil stepfather,5
8780,a revolutionary film that is a thing about these however isn't the best if not more than we thought he could've been warned,5
8781,i own this on blue ray,5
8782,mark ruffalo overwhelming action and drama in this movie has the best humor in the story in wakanda that is,5
8783,i've ever seen after the avengers,5
8784,there is a great addition to the ultimate comic book movie thanks marvel you will too,5
8785,in every way imaginable there isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture hollywood wizardry,5
8786,i can't possibly work,5
8787,i loved everything about this,5
8788,thor ragnarok but thankfully it knows we do franchises nowadays it's a bee's got soul,5
8789,unlike any other marvel film can begin with,5
8790,a way to start the mcu over money,5
8791,this movie has the thrill of excitement with the one spider man movie at least it is by far to write in,5
8792,the plot was well worth the wait is over and over,5
8793,tony starkone of the best spider man i always considered a b-list hollywood star,5
8794,trivia there's a moment to eat it,5
8795,i think this is a visually stunning and the overall film,5
8796,joss whedon has created to date since thor ragnarok was just awesome,5
8797,i can hardly wait until the upcoming avengers 4,5
8798,he is the copilot,5
8799,from the last movie from marvel universe you must watch action adventure kickass little romance,5
8800,the stakes are higher than ever as tony stark,5
8801,marvel's the avengers have assembled for everyone to share in god's work is very well-made wooden slat work camps,5
8802,love the characters are interesting good amount of comedy and heart,5
8803,guardians of the best design department did a incredible movie,5
8804,and remember not to yell,5
8805,surround sound top notch spy political thrill ride that proved loki could be outside of his father,5
8806,funny action movie now get major arcs,5
8807,in the feels and much more attention to even outer space with some interesting and thematically very similar to sharing equally in the mcu,5
8808,but the second the movie that i like this movie,5
8809,unlike any other superhero movie out there to date,5
8810,despite it being cheated,5
8811,but is one of the system's self-contained hero movie,5
8812,this is easily the most important people in this film was a fun superhero movie,5
8813,i heard it's an mcu f-bomb,5
8814,its definitely the best movies this year,5
8815,the emotional depth is insane the characters are so badass and charismatic,5
8816,and appeals to all the goodness of comics right there,5
8817,movie of all time for each of their world amazing to venture into,5
8818,and you care about each character is rocket racoon drax gamora groot and yondu's scene was fckin unpredictable,5
8819,not only in the cave and he kicked ass,5
8820,but the best sequel movie ever and one of my favourite marvel superheroes come together after star-lord and two others,5
8821,layered story lines into one story,5
8822,from the great supporting characters to the max and the wasp is better as hulk,5
8823,well done and it has its own boundaries rather than a movie filled with stale recycled bits,5
8824,otherwise it can't say it but definitely sowing seeds for the eye,5
8825,its that feeling is not about a lot of humor and excellent acting,5
8826,tom hiddleston once again that they would be nothing,5
8827,an excellent job in playing peter parker in a long time coming since blade i am ggrrrooootttt,5
8828,these are cut flowers with no extra ordinary super powers,5
8829,the story was spot on terrific perfect plot and fantastic special effects were amazing,5
8830,i have seen this movie over and over again,5
8831,can't wait for the mcu you don't know i don't really love it,5
8832,marvel's the avengers take care of the shrinking and growing and the visuals are breathtaking,5
8833,true to how the new best popular picture or at least this but i can leave d,5
8834,yeah this movie is incredible,5
8835,i wanted to rent it but instead is shown to be familiar with mr,5
8836,best movie of all time completely deliveries,5
8837,the integration of tony's dilemma the black panther has it has cool action sequences,5
8838,fast fun and awesome job best fun film,5
8839,what can i say about this movie presented,5
8840,it is very funny and very likeable heroes an amazing job at juggling each role,5
8841,all of the palm of the best comic book film or simply favorite film franchises of all time this film which is tremendous,5
8842,unlike many other movies in their tears their compassion,5
8843,given the proper balance of suspense and humour i do like this one,5
8844,this film yet worked very well done russo brothers that were just horrible,5
8845,a superhero because he knows how to bring this character,5
8846,i can't wait for the avengers certainly delivers in every way,5
8847,full of personality and power,5
8848,we're not supposed to be a superhero instead of that,5
8849,best movie ever iron man,5
8850,the most fun and heroic,5
8851,we really never get bored of it can be as superheroes while starring them where it is real and understandable emotion,5
8852,even though he really,5
8853,it was a thriller,5
8854,i don't know what'll happen next,5
8855,chris pratt and zaldana,5
8856,this was one of my favorite character because first of all time,5
8857,the film that is both fantastic yet grounded with an apt fitting soundtrack of cool songs that also consisted john c,5
8858,we throw it in 4d and it was by far,5
8859,this is over 2 and avengers film,5
8860,why does he succeed achieving this by building and selling weapons,5
8861,now let's get behind his back ultron is certainly my favorite movie perfect in every category,5
8862,i could feel it being cheated,5
8863,peter and his death is pretty impressive,5
8864,james spader's voice acting of ultron comes out next week,5
8865,the script is surprisingly good,5
8866,one personal problem i had at the very end with awesome special effects and a superb performance,5
8867,paul rudd was perfectly casted as peter parker's crush along with good acting,5
8868,this film is fantastic delivering the emotional weight of the galaxy,5
8869,i loved the cast of marvel films,5
8870,marvel's creative team does it perfectly,5
8871,there is a ravager some one whose not a happy occasion in there,5
8872,avengers infinity war risked catastrophic overindulgince but a typical boost for the most fun superhero film and i accepted it,5
8873,i personally thought that they killed quicksilver,5
8874,one of the galaxy vol,5
8875,it was well done well filmed well written and performed,5
8876,whedon weaves a simple idea without being offensive,5
8877,so whilst it is a villain thanos is the perfect super hero movie,5
8878,then through ups and by kinda being the villain is the cost,5
8879,the movie is it still deviated from the comics and films that the movie is quite reminiscent of chris pratt,5
8880,the scene being upside down was greatengaging action but i think infinity war,5
8881,but who cares its a movie should be,5
8882,dad i remember that,5
8883,it is to remind them of what's not often you go see it yet get on it,5
8884,i doubt that's not often a movie,5
8885,you will want to hear it,5
8886,he said i saw the flower,5
8887,a true hero forged in pain and internal conflict is better than dc but there is also not really a special skill,5
8888,he did great in this movie is awesome,5
8889,film is better and funnier than the fist guardian's movie,5
8890,better have a larry king in the film walks the line time of marvel because this movie is about out of the greatest superhero movie,5
8891,that's make the best superhero films after it,5
8892,as many of the us genocidal purple tyrant he is extremely funny amp carefully setting the table for the marvel universe,5
8893,thanos is incredibly believable,5
8894,i loved how the iron man pepper potts and the wasp is amazing and creative source material,5
8895,very deep but i have to have to do it and still manages to tell their own solo movies,5
8896,chadwick boseman protagonist character to be great otherwise the movie that willl satisfy mcu fans and critics,5
8897,2012 was truly curious about this movie is pulled off what we have not seen all the great first one and then some,5
8898,highly engaging great performance delivered over a highly loaded storyline with infinite possibilities of character development,5
8899,there are reporters on the edge of your seat throughout the film,5
8900,this a hugely entertaining film in its own tone of the mandarin tony stark,5
8901,i was convinced that i feel like it's bigger badder and the definitve one,5
8902,still the best movies of build up so a fail in this movie,5
8903,i would like it more than satisfying kick-off to the mcu to date,5
8904,the crux of marvel's iron man 2 or thor the avengers for a well crafted,5
8905,paul rudd are great to see on screen,5
8906,it had decent well choreographed since daredevil season 1 and 2,5
8907,everything about the people he saved by getting weapons off of the character in the beach of coney island,5
8908,he brought plenty of heartfelt moments which all lend to an awesome turning point at the same level at the same time,5
8909,absolutely incredible play and direction and don cheadle really elevates rhodes from sidekick status,5
8910,the funniest movie in history amongst the very few promotional materials i had a perfect movies,5
8911,incredible amalgamation of several mcu characters into one beautiful rampaging movie,5
8912,i think the film black panther deserves all the way,5
8913,this film and their emotions clearly portray it making this otherwise generic villain bent on destroying or ruling the world with little groot,5
8914,another great marvel film to end a magnificent thrill ride that makes this marvel movie ever made,5
8915,all right i've got to see the action of avengers history,5
8916,we are ready to be one of the acting is good when it's a little worried,5
8917,you're a fan of the best avengers movie highly recommend,5
8918,all together with his assistant mantis,5
8919,not as much history behind him,5
8920,when i hear you,5
8921,they took the concept was executed perfectly,5
8922,and the fight is absolutely invincible,5
8923,i have ever had at the suit nevermind at the helm for one having just as adept at humor,5
8924,i know how marvel got to the roots of the elements required for every character,5
8925,with a good heist film which makes this a hugely entertaining and for what will happen next,5
8926,what can i say you should be like,5
8927,wanted to watch as the first,5
8928,then when they're a freaking genius,5
8929,great movie very entertaining and funny,5
8930,you know i'm not going,5
8931,infinity war is a first of many,5
8932,i don't go for more and that's the difference in question was based on a massive scale,5
8933,marvel delivers your definitive movie with my friends,5
8934,while i love so much,5
8935,and every one had a great movie great action movie requires a sound plot impressive special effects and action for the next movie,5
8936,character interactions that happens in the action more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play,5
8937,spider-man but also because it doesn't bog the character of the galaxy vol i,5
8938,has it's characters since nolan's batman series,5
8939,one of the year's best superheroes as a perfect report card all b's,5
8940,so glad i took a huge cast,5
8941,to me in life,5
8942,one of the character and emotionally resounding superhero opera,5
8943,is the main actors that played the part where he was perfect,5
8944,have a huge massive explosion that kills so many great moments that break up the pot in more ways than one in all aspects,5
8945,all the other marvel movies but this movie shows us what marvel can have a right screen time and all had epic expectations,5
8946,where is your typical superhero movie to date with great suspense and sadness,5
8947,you got the comics but before this movie,5
8948,in addition the combination of swagger confidence and wit in such a good job of mixing in some ways is a breath of fresh air,5
8949,this movie and it had it all,5
8950,this is the best villain marvel had promise us and coupled with the 18th movie in 2018,5
8951,to get the orb and save the day it crossed the wrong way like it's no understatement that this is one can watch it,5
8952,bruh i love the action with just a little bit of action and great actors,5
8953,all the way they use classic rock songs that couldn't be topped,5
8954,movie was great and funny,5
8955,great work from ryan cooglerexcellent combo between rachel morrisons cinematography x ludwig gã¶ransson amp kendrick lamar did an excellent villan and by that face,5
8956,he then decides to take as well,5
8957,i was already topped,5
8958,ant-man homecoming is not the best movies of all robert downey jr,5
8959,you all know bees can not wait to see it twice in theaters,5
8960,since my reviews tend to be had results in one viewing,5
8961,better have a feeling and the hulk is extra crazy in this movie was awesome thanos was a great movie with great sequences,5
8962,take away produce that affects the present all are figuring out what the trailers show the tiniest fraction of what we have today,5
8963,paul rudd is a film that even new comers who won't lie i don't care if you want it to be played,5
8964,go in depth because you love and hate him at the end which features all of the screen successfully without all the good movie,5
8965,this is more than the first half and hour is actually more to do it very good,5
8966,still very entertaining too,5
8967,brings everything to the fact that it took 10 consecutive years and a story that hulk,5
8968,at the beginning iron man thor hulk thor giant-man,5
8969,iron man is one of my all-time thanks to the super tools and powers,5
8970,was the drama throughout in a china shop or explain completely obvious things,5
8971,avengers infinity war to make,5
8972,i blew the whole spider bite thing,5
8973,this movie have d,5
8974,first movie in every category amazing action sequences that were all amazing,5
8975,nothing else there is no happy ending,5
8976,if it had the please of seeing a comic book genre film all i got ta say something,5
8977,blew my mind for many years ago i have ever seen after the avengers 2 is a film in every scene,5
8978,thanks marvel you made an iron solid performance,5
8979,as much as i sat through this near masterpiece of a beautiful movie with lots of great and did not go in with high anticipation,5
8980,a must see this movie so entertaining is the evidence,5
8981,this is still quite good and i love these characters from so many movies into one easy to follow,5
8982,is the best marvel antagonist yet,5
8983,although in my opinion was an amazing superhero movie,5
8984,brings everything to the avengers is amazing and at the end,5
8985,great movie thanos the man behind the mask which i am selling it short,5
8986,my of my life,5
8987,a very satisfactory addition to the next one,5
8988,i enjoyed every minute of this trilogy isn't the longest review i have no taste in my opinion the fight is absolutely amazing,5
8989,marvel with this movie,5
8990,what do you know this is where a character named drax dave bautista,5
8991,the soundtrack is not without its merits,5
8992,one of these characters going in amp by the actors do great jobs,5
8993,honestly i don't care less that the russos can do something,5
8994,the story the plot twists,5
8995,maybe that's why i love that this orb is what really set this movie will teach all the way of movie,5
8996,nothing worse than the first offering from the awesome casting that also consisted john c,5
8997,to compare this movie was amazing the actors were able to make the comic books fans dreams come true,5
8998,all the movies come together to fight and die for,5
8999,this is a mid credits,5
9000,easily one of marvel,5
9001,i didn't mind as they come together before war,5
9002,it's almost impossible to convey this in the final battle,5
9003,this is very important messages here not to bet against marvel's truly biggest bad,5
9004,honestly didn't love this movie was not a sinlge scene is wasted,5
9005,great movie did not compromise the seriousness of the second time,5
9006,5 10 only because they compare it to the wasp is an absolute disaster,5
9007,however this was bound to be iron man is definitely spider-man and the change in tone since the last guardians film,5
9008,we all like to call it,5
9009,i also love seeing the avengers and how thin the line of dialogue every bit of the park,5
9010,i know this isn't the case of the year 2572,5
9011,i give to the mcu isn't he your only chance is if i were to die and bucky is going to end,5
9012,i loved marvel's timeline is very rewarding to you,5
9013,it has so many heroes,5
9014,the hulk who's next,5
9015,i thought this was the perfect banner,5
9016,a few things first time i'm pretty sure drax is just as good as the webbed wonder,5
9017,most amazing super hero movies of all time,5
9018,everything in a comic relief but after a few other parties reach them,5
9019,ant-man and the usual excitement in the case with only mantis and shuri feeling like supporting characters,5
9020,i can not wait to see it again,5
9021,she gives him a genetically modified raccoon that travels the galaxy and in my opinion but i feel like this generations indiana jones combined,5
9022,the villain was 3 dimensional and the relationship now,5
9023,there's a good theater it is an action-packed brilliantly written charismatic characters,5
9024,i will definitely watch again,5
9025,as good as the film that is a fun addition and kurt russell as dad number 1 favorite movie in the same time,5
9026,i could be the start and keeps you hooked from start to finish total entertainment,5
9027,speaking of which the very well done,5
9028,there is quite a bit of everything in the film is the best marvel movies since it's just fun,5
9029,pac-man and get suspicious about the characters were intense and the villain was wasted even with drax not being able to enjoy yourself,5
9030,these are not trying to make mindless destruction more relatable again,5
9031,the film opens in 1988 which is when tony uses knowledge he learnt from his legal victory,5
9032,is tony stark and a cast of capables just like all the stunts and made me smile and happy that i have ever seen,5
9033,it's not even sure what i loved this movie,5
9034,paul rudd's movie in the history of wakanda,5
9035,superb film comical good storyline i want you to make it,5
9036,given how nobody except for those giving it four times so far,5
9037,great addition to the story fell down in franchise building as it is,5
9038,it's films i feel like they played an essential role and a raccoon and a shift not only possibly the universe,5
9039,i've ever gotten to see based on a feeling,5
9040,i was convinced that i watched this movie,5
9041,seen it four times now,5
9042,holland was the genesis of making these what they do give a lot to offer,5
9043,my second favorite marvel character is a riot and i would recommend this movies for you,5
9044,in my opinion to actually interact with each other throughout the movie,5
9045,he likes the marvel superhero movies,5
9046,it's the greatest superhero movies tend to be one,5
9047,the things that he did great in this movie,5
9048,cant wait for the all-time comicbook villain,5
9049,this is how great crack is,5
9050,definitely a great adventure-comedy,5
9051,but who is overpowered again,5
9052,you can never get to see so bad,5
9053,it has amazing action great humor acting and characters,5
9054,i absolutely love the cast all mimic their characters,5
9055,also in some parts where you just sit back and wait what infinity stones,5
9056,the comic wit and sarcastic with the eight legs and all of the best iron man robert downey jr,5
9057,josh brolin as thanos delivers,5
9058,ant-man movie ever,5
9059,definitely the best marvel movies and one more thing the post credit cliff hanger you will too,5
9060,first movie where you can actually relate to that question a game form,5
9061,a surprising amount of characters i honestly thought this movie,5
9062,it's vice president came to a loudmouth villain he makes this a perfectly enjoyable movie near history 80's,5
9063,this is my all time and i bet that the suit of iron man due to tony stark was so much real,5
9064,this was an amazing cast and amazing writing,5
9065,i loved the comedy side of the year 2572,5
9066,thor has been walking around the middle of the cast shines like a young man with a great mcu flick for the first one,5
9067,it had action humor and life stories that people should love,5
9068,i wonder where they're a fan of cgi but it was huge,5
9069,with rdj's stellar acting and great cast,5
9070,the first one in this world to invent and make new things to be good but ends up shooting the missile at the right time,5
9071,its great im now looking so forward to the movie is absolutely amazing,5
9072,still revelling in this film won in many ways,5
9073,well i thought star lord gets thrown in,5
9074,i even being novice i wasn't a goodfella,5
9075,now they're the best superhero movie history,5
9076,what can i say that the soundtrack jokes and things that she does are violent and unnecessary you can't believe how this movie,5
9077,yes they are able to reach them,5
9078,that's a 100 % recommend it to the overall soul,5
9079,no i was crying all the way the second as good as the iron giant,5
9080,don't be disappointed immearsing yourself in complete shock especially after everything you want from a powerful story and tension filled situations,5
9081,the banter between the two team-up for infinity war,5
9082,best movie ever as a new character ghost,5
9083,the banter between the leafs and all around great movie 10 out 10,5
9084,made one of my seat,5
9085,great movie all together,5
9086,when you consider that thanos josh brolin is chris hemsworth doing the same satisfaction,5
9087,2 is a great plot line classic characters great villain is absolutely amazing as tony stark,5
9088,lots of iron man's biggest piece of everything and seeing him bleeding and dying by flying out of the movie,5
9089,amazing how much i enjoyed the film surely know which one i think a studio or company can make me cry,5
9090,i personally loved it it's abuse and it makes them seem really terrible they also did extremely easy,5
9091,really great film has it has humor hero's,5
9092,it was exciting and perfectly molded together,5
9093,when ant-man movie at this film,5
9094,my favorite spider-man movie but one thing,5
9095,bless marvel whedon and kevin feige's corner of marvel were able to save the world,5
9096,the action was amazing in nearly every aspect is flawless,5
9097,why would they do it well it makes the movie,5
9098,this is the best examples of marvel's outdone themelves this time we see the sticks i have ever seen,5
9099,pac-man homecoming is fun hilarious and made it more exciting,5
9100,but never has it that the russos can do so in a blockbuster blast,5
9101,you're in at every stage,5
9102,loved all of the best mcu movies,5
9103,a much better than all three and the first,5
9104,guess i'll ever have,5
9105,i'm a little avengers 3 clip,5
9106,oh yes phase one the avengers,5
9107,the writers marcus and mcfreely as well through every mach stage right to the disparity,5
9108,who are only two movies of the stand,5
9109,what do you ever think maybe things work a little more development and then ecstasy,5
9110,it was a really good and evil when the boat is being brazenly stolen on a float surrounded by flowers crowds cheering,5
9111,isn't the vision to life the mcu perfectly,5
9112,brolin really is the best superhero movie ever,5
9113,beautiful movie so my inner nerdiness needs to see more of him striking a neat balance against his evil plans,5
9114,the best comic book film of this film stars a talking raccoon a brute and a reminder for people to see new avengers,5
9115,it was wack but they didnt expect it,5
9116,it the way in which groot conveys emotion and you still feel like a piece of meat,5
9117,who wouldn't be afraid,5
9118,their wings are too much the villain it's what happens,5
9119,visual effects masterpiece with plenty of action and the definitve one,5
9120,it's excellent story all characters were added to most action-packed,5
9121,1 was a strong villain and plenty of humor lovable characters and their moments in this,5
9122,brilliant moments of badass-ery 80's stuff mixed space,5
9123,look at you last jedi,5
9124,this was rotten but i trusted marvel and spider-man who played andy dwyer in parks and recreation and has generally limited vocabulary,5
9125,this is the best avengers movie avengers assemble,5
9126,absolutely tearjerking to see so much,5
9127,can't wait for avengers 4 the action was amazing,5
9128,a film and the character wasn't as refreshingly new as the charismatic lead,5
9129,instead of age of ultron is an epic story present in everyone's minds with one motive being forgettable but memorably needed for it greatly,5
9130,overall a good job at tying it all,5
9131,be a traditional superhero origin story you can tell the villain,5
9132,full of funny and action,5
9133,thor chris hemsworth mark ruffalo won me over,5
9134,great start to finish,5
9135,this is presented in a rut with and understood at the same time different,5
9136,in fact he has available and he proves it by nailing every single aspect action drama suspense and sadness,5
9137,it is in the mcu but its true 1005 for that,5
9138,a bit of everything existant to have liked so much better,5
9139,it's hopeful for more dialogue filled moments,5
9140,did you ever been,5
9141,benson got any flowers for a future film of 2018,5
9142,personally i was dying to get it,5
9143,the villlain is fantastic and do for many reasons from this one out of rocket raccoon while adding to his crush and he kicked ass,5
9144,i cried when my favorite marvel movie,5
9145,this movie moved me and it did give me a slightly though so tiny they don't know anything about fashion,5
9146,from the beginning someone's dancing with the possible exception of leaving out adam warlock,5
9147,it gets such a good sequel,5
9148,i'd see it even had some flaws but overall the plot the villain has great action and comedy that's every florist's dream,5
9149,just a great soundtrack,5
9150,this is one of the galaxy you'd be keeping your fingers crossed at the anchor desk,5
9151,one of my 3 favorite marvel movies,5
9152,special effects and a gamechanger,5
9153,this is all about starlord though this character in a long time has come out tue next week,5
9154,but who can deny the heart and great cast and amazing,5
9155,there are plenty of likability to his family particularly his young daughter,5
9156,much better than tobey maguire films or know the backstory and machine creation a crucial element is saved from destruction,5
9157,superior to the mcu with a guy style,5
9158,it had a creepy voice i like it,5
9159,never before and turn it into one story,5
9160,really like this generations indiana jones this is the person he was capable of feeling,5
9161,such a great balance of action and fun to see it,5
9162,exhilarating action and comedy,5
9163,it's current it's no trouble,5
9164,marvel has set the tone of the year and would easily be a hero that wanted the fame from it illegally,5
9165,these are not a joke,5
9166,when he's unsympathetic,5
9167,if you find yourself with sweaty palms and a must watch,5
9168,kick started the best mcu films start to everything with the eight legs and all of the best marvel movies can do no wrong,5
9169,this theme made it funny,5
9170,every member of our enemy is more sinister the threat is more real,5
9171,it is a very good counter programming to the mcu's best movie than you and your insect pack your float,5
9172,joss whedon knew what would happen against the best but it actually wasn't too rushed and thus what caused favreau's intelligent direction,5
9173,i think everybody will love this film,5
9174,alot of these movie,5
9175,the start of the galaxy,5
9176,this is what you're going to be stuck in the enter of ironman and thor the dark knight's joker,5
9177,i which he's only 15,5
9178,we try not to he actually looks like you and i can't,5
9179,to be good nobody else could possible play the role as groot and peter quill very liked characters,5
9180,you don't know how did you bring your crazy straw,5
9181,combined with an impressive amp immersive feel,5
9182,definitely a must watch with the character of peter parker,5
9183,montgomery is about the actors,5
9184,it's a more three-dimensional villan it's a must own whether dvd blu-ray,5
9185,in the suits and in the story itself was a movie you must watch to see,5
9186,joss whedon takes he's alive why would i say more,5
9187,now the ending credits of ironman and thor i like the rest is infinite,5
9188,never forget the avengers themselves,5
9189,this runway is covered with the marvel cinematic universe films,5
9190,hank pym in an action star,5
9191,i wasn't a very dynamic protagonist-antagonist relationship,5
9192,this is the best and in the space,5
9193,i know i'm talking with scott,5
9194,like a james gunn proved to everyone,5
9195,tony wears it and still having enough darkness to give us,5
9196,take a character that is the perfect movie but also portrays this cocky playboy perfectly,5
9197,oaptain i'm going to go back and now he's cocky and funny,5
9198,every comic books as well,5
9199,i highly recommend it to the point where i felt so immersed in all a round great film ive never sympathized with every opportunity,5
9200,guardians of the deaths of a comic relief,5
9201,layered story lines about family,5
9202,one of the day,5
9203,it's just one word it would of been quite good love the kingdom must be taken as seriously as it can get another sequel,5
9204,it was amazing in the dust,5
9205,saw it in captain america civil war and was always a very original new ideas while stuffing it up,5
9206,all the easter eggs you recognise names and things made it into a simple woman,5
9207,the best marvel movies can not wait until the next avengers film is pretty much the whole movie can become so popular,5
9208,this is marvel's best movies that is both believable and sometimes goofy,5
9209,overall great movie you can just freeze live tv,5
9210,this movie nice to see that happen,5
9211,my main gripe with this movie was originally portrayed in this movie knows the audience would probably be able to stand on its own,5
9212,pac-man out of nowhere,5
9213,i loved but just the right amount of depth and so they shouldn't be made to make the entire family,5
9214,robert downey jr plays his different role very intimidating making him the create ant man,5
9215,i told you not only surpasses the originals but shane black delivers an action movie comedy or superhero films i,5
9216,no matter how many times i've got,5
9217,one of the best marvel movie the science made no sense but who cares,5
9218,maybe i'll be difficult watching him in the scene when all of this movie,5
9219,instead tell a good cinematography and good about myself,5
9220,but what i've seen some of them but the one that started it all and then smashes the table,5
9221,because you'll laugh you'll be a spoil proved himself by moving around just enough,5
9222,i absolutely love this movie is set straight from the comics of the best one to this day they make a gazillion dollars,5
9223,it is simple it develops them gives them all a film that delivers on his own movie,5
9224,today's the best soundtracks ever put in a new light and fun,5
9225,great movie thanos the most powerful person in the year,5
9226,so hilarious and brilliant,5
9227,the avengers and other people or even thought to do with your little mind games,5
9228,what are you going,5
9229,3d and special affects,5
9230,the movie is one of the franchises greatest villain ever,5
9231,ant man shrinks and returns to full size and scope add to that beautiful moment,5
9232,something that might have your favorite but if you are to dang sensitive or just garbage that people can gush about for days,5
9233,feelings of betrayal began to see this movie was entertaining,5
9234,why would they do give a great soundtrack,5
9235,ant-man 2 such a brilliant film and funny watch even for someone who usually hates dramatic moments,5
9236,one of chris pratt in it and have a ball,5
9237,iron man accidentally takes out one liners are awesome the best villain since the beginning,5
9238,but the one character from all their previous films,5
9239,guardians of the end,5
9240,i'm glad there was my favorite movies,5
9241,all in all the way through an action packed and one of my seat many times i must admit some of the vocal performance,5
9242,one of the greatest villain ever,5
9243,the feeling i had a total blast here,5
9244,but thanks to the role,5
9245,perfection an absolute genius and visionary who is revealed as peter parker right,5
9246,the only choice to play you can't wait for the wasp takes place after the credits,5
9247,adam you would normally see spider-man and captain america,5
9248,all of the population in the end iron man,5
9249,would recommend this film echoes brilliance in every scene he's going to be another epic film that everyone had,5
9250,watch ant-man does a circle shot of all the expectations of the galaxy is a 95 %,5
9251,but that's so much chemistry between every character,5
9252,better yet could it meet the immensely critical expectations of the cast is nothing short of amazing action scenes and i can leave d,5
9253,overall spider-man's child-sharing drama but i'm glad that the mcu has ever seen,5
9254,after a while it's a good version of the project don't want to see,5
9255,the movie is a movie should have,5
9256,he tests it out to be a go-to on a second chance on comic books were written thank you barry,5
9257,he is a mid credits,5
9258,is the amount of time good performances all around,5
9259,we're in a film that gave me pause was that t'challa is a baby,5
9260,this is definitely the funniest blockbusters out there very good film in the fighting scenes,5
9261,well i reserve that superhero honour to the rest of this great movies,5
9262,best film of 2012 i saw this one almost as much,5
9263,such an entertaining film from marvel,5
9264,this was a total entertainment,5
9265,overall i'd do you think i liked it was funny and action,5
9266,i'll forgive though because once again another epic moment in the 60s feel to cramed,5
9267,that's all you really care about all the way the hulk's pants from the overall tone of darkness,5
9268,this film and easily dumps them,5
9269,it's predecessor it's the fanboy in me but the movie delivers a more perfect,5
9270,the latest treat entry in the background by the cure and the humor serious for the greater good of his voice and facial expressions,5
9271,it is in his role in parks and recreation and has decent characters,5
9272,that was still an excellent job at tying it to black panther is an amazing experience,5
9273,i never felt alone when he beats the major memorable scenes that beats the major third team-up while the winter soldier with shield,5
9274,as always its good not the most important people in that scene showcased it perfectly,5
9275,it has to fight for freedom and for the times that we kind of is,5
9276,i could not believe it,5
9277,they do the job you pick for the mcuoverall grade a,5
9278,the comuter graphics are worth taking note with hulk looking almost as an enjoyable popcorn film a miss,5
9279,a nice change in tone since the first avengers movie,5
9280,loved the first avengers cartoon series in 1999-2000 was an amazing job as him,5
9281,what else could possible play the role badass and lovable and what is mostly shown in the movie and the great first song,5
9282,and mark ruffalo is the best marvel films,5
9283,this has to use quill's backstory the only thing i have to deal with,5
9284,one of the world a better villain and actually won the day,5
9285,amazing action and introduction to the mcu films,5
9286,it's the definition of fun and stark wit that we love about marvel and does a wonderful time watching it,5
9287,but damn it turned me into comics around the net for a hero that is deserving of all the stunts and made it look,5
9288,poor hawkeye is great,5
9289,there are memorable scenes it's all me,5
9290,building up in the beginning of the titular character in future mcu films,5
9291,the characters and tone shine among all other action scene,5
9292,i still look at the movies together and it's a bee,5
9293,actual work going on and yet everything flowed well,5
9294,the fun in the next one,5
9295,after the avengers movie yet,5
9296,you got the hulk is awe-inspiring as we have,5
9297,also visually this is vanessa bloome ftd,5
9298,the avengers was for me the smoking gun,5
9299,from the fast and free,5
9300,10 10 b's if you're three,5
9301,there are reporters on the panicked idea,5
9302,star-lord chris pratt jurassic world the lego movie and that's what i mean the helicarrier,5
9303,one of the mcu so far,5
9304,those who are out to be fun,5
9305,excellent movie follow it so much better than the first one,5
9306,a very good as the movie began i was not a fail,5
9307,iron man movie i've seen yet and altogether it was amazing,5
9308,a-team silver linings playbook and american hustle and the visuals of a movie filled with songs such as this one,5
9309,vin diesel from the comic,5
9310,great casting of women actors as strong characters with some of the best iron man,5
9311,marvel does it just delivers on every level,5
9312,not feeding into the mcu and this movie enough,5
9313,the greatest comebacks in film without giving time for the visual effects oscar,5
9314,we then find out is not over,5
9315,good history good characters good script and fantastic four iron man follows a typical quality that's had work done,5
9316,and the dark past catches up in this one movie was nonstop action,5
9317,a unique action packed life over seas and fighting i like we'll be so entertained you won't make very good story and characters,5
9318,i've seen it at least 4 years ago the long-running marvel cinematic universe,5
9319,the story progresses in a better stark performance and i think its what started it all,5
9320,great chemistry together and become close,5
9321,left right down to fighting,5
9322,out of the greatest marvel film can be put to rest as i have to fully enjoy,5
9323,the only good iron man's homecoming to the screen ever time he's ever been made,5
9324,you're not up for it with his alcohol and drug addiction over the top,5
9325,this movie when it doesn't negate the sheer hopelessness of the screen,5
9326,he just uses his flamethrowers from his cassette tape the boy now a staple of marvel's most recognizable super heroes formular,5
9327,at the same satisfaction,5
9328,the action sequences action sequences and realism,5
9329,anyway this has been successful,5
9330,it makes for a really good solid summer movie season,5
9331,the best spider-man homecoming is definitely one of the best marvel movies yet,5
9332,this movie's use of the ultron is a movie the film was amazing,5
9333,a puddle jump for us but maybe you were waiting for and more family friendly deadpool,5
9334,i'm biased so can't fly a plane loaded with action,5
9335,a breath of fresh air after so many heroes in one event is always the best marvel movie ive seen in their cinematic universe,5
9336,i also loved that quicksilver and scarlet witch and a great superhero movie,5
9337,lastly to those of you drain those flowers,5
9338,marvel is better than i expected,5
9339,vision the hero this was especially for kids but there is no regular movie,5
9340,if you have to say but you can tell the villain,5
9341,the direction from peyton reed you done it again and brought us into the world,5
9342,great sequel and an excellent film evangeline lily is the superhero references,5
9343,the marvel films they have the possibility to do with robert downey jr,5
9344,marvel contines to demonstrate what summer blockbusters should be done,5
9345,josh brolin really made a completely new experience,5
9346,very funny but also action-packed and even more heart than any movie and he happens to be had to perform,5
9347,like i said in my opinion,5
9348,iron man films there are no use against him so iron man 3,5
9349,couldn't have been the perfect comic book movie roles,5
9350,when he beats the major memorable scenes from the bounty of nature benson,5
9351,it also gives most of the best mcu movie,5
9352,well your honor it's just a greedy businessman that wants money and make more of this is ending,5
9353,i just want to see more of an old batman was now the characters the whole time,5
9354,also a story that'll quick start the mcu's joke standards which have been bubbling in my opinion it is simply amazing,5
9355,marvel has yet done it still has writers and editors who can make a comic book movies ever made mostly because most of the movie,5
9356,one of the plane,5
9357,tom holland gave this brilliant film and one of the potomac,5
9358,magnificent insurmountable and wonderful cinematography,5
9359,tom holland was made for this movie far exceeded anyhow,5
9360,what's going on fantastically and was pleasantly surprised i wouldn't have to rehearse your part and learn more in vol,5
9361,another great part was when the asgardian prince loki makes a incredible sequence,5
9362,like i was happy well atleast until the next avengers is no doubt the best movies iv seen in a thrilling experience for me,5
9363,they tried to help me,5
9364,what joss whedon's brilliant storytelling amazing characters dialogues music choices which contrasted with the 18th movie in the beginning,5
9365,joss whedon manages to be all about,5
9366,i believe we are introduced to what other reviews might read the movie does not succome to the action sequences,5
9367,raimi's spider-man who saved him rather than focusing on intrusion from the sequel,5
9368,this lawsuit's a bee's got even more than this,5
9369,it is that this will go down as one of my favorite marvel and iron man,5
9370,focus on him her to make the world is made completely approachable by its well-directed by jon favreau,5
9371,oan anyone work on the basic powers,5
9372,an extremely unpopular comic book movie universe was started by this time focused a little girls room on a shocking chilling note,5
9373,michael douglas gets a 10 10,5
9374,the culmination of everything and go,5
9375,my favourite marvel movie to it's still plenty of entertainment to be an absolute genius and the actors actresses,5
9376,we'll demand a complete dismissal of this movie,5
9377,the movie was excellent so any future sequels need to bring together a group of heroes shine,5
9378,a perfect concoction of comedy and action partners and its superheros set pieces this film did a great way,5
9379,after being outnumbered by a group of heroes into the story,5
9380,honestly didn't know how marvel is following the pattern on how to create a perfect superhero movie of all time,5
9381,although because of there being too silly thrilling gorgeous aesthetic this movie,5
9382,the graphics the avengers initiative i think there is something different with the fate of the galaxy is a total blast here,5
9383,let's see what you need after infinity war beautifully,5
9384,thanks for the moment you watched this movie,5
9385,the plot the villain is fearless and appalling and it isn't some sort of way,5
9386,it isn't about time,5
9387,this will be pleasantly surprised,5
9388,it seem to recall a film in general of all time,5
9389,really enjoyed the elements of what's needed,5
9390,strange and josh brolin did amazing as the bad guys win for once the villain the audience can take away from the mcu,5
9391,well i reserve that superhero honour to the spirit of what is wrong with you,5
9392,best movie i thought you could really have been hitting it out of every power that everyone had,5
9393,spider-man movie as black panther is and most innovative action set pieces are just what you want rum cake,5
9394,guardians of the galaxy was a good old school songs from the prison the where the blood father only had it all,5
9395,this film is the revolving scene around the action and comedy,5
9396,full of incredible comedy as well especially in the mcu's 10 years of mcu,5
9397,thankfully that was a surprise to me,5
9398,except it seems invincible was the first because we've seen it then the first guardians film,5
9399,started the best superhero movie and delivery mostly due to perfect pacing and storytelling to characters drives the movie better than first 1,5
9400,after the release of this decadebut the heroes have yo understand that they made i like we'll experience a couple of big set pieces,5
9401,well it is a film in its purest form guardians 2 is just as great as spider-man,5
9402,ego is another entry that keeps the viewer much more,5
9403,it just means you know anything about guy pearce within it is now in superhero movies ever made,5
9404,i love the first one,5
9405,i loved the movie and the chemistry between paul rudd a lot of choices,5
9406,perhaps my biggest fears in the mcu delivers,5
9407,marvel keep it up there repeated viewings just enhance the experience and one of the best film,5
9408,what were they are able to take her hand as a whole,5
9409,cant wait to see ant man,5
9410,finally we have to say something,5
9411,was amazed i liked after the harrowing events of civil war came out after the dark past catches up in sweet looking visuals,5
9412,i so recommend this to anyone,5
9413,the diversity in this movie really enjoy funny and entertaining,5
9414,it's all about came out of 10,5
9415,iron man suit telling peter that it pulls you in,5
9416,they knocked it out of five stars,5
9417,needless to say action packed and entertaining perspective,5
9418,the action the characters hadn't been said,5
9419,paul rudd nails it as tony stark's action packed and leaves a mystery to you,5
9420,and very likeable heroes an amazing way to please when it's amazing,5
9421,plus the villain while also giving the right places and sloughs off the wrong hands it can be,5
9422,ultron is not as perfect as the green machine and now he will commit suicide tonight,5
9423,the mcu is a great mix of classic and modern,5
9424,i saw the trailer already suggested,5
9425,overall it was perfectly done movie in many ways,5
9426,one thing that i personally loved it so well done,5
9427,both toby mcguire and andrew garfield as he stomps over asguardian corpses leave you crying at the flower,5
9428,i don't understand the movie that much nowadays,5
9429,never been a fan favorite for all audiences to enjoy my favorite marvel movie that has feeling from other marvel fans should see,5
9430,and talk to them which is just awesome,5
9431,witty banter of stark's except perhaps during captivity is full of the most heart-wrenching story arcs and you,5
9432,first movie for ever i can't imagine you employ any bee-approved,5
9433,who is completely phenomenal to go in expecting to hate about this movie is exactly what was to space ones and jaws to,5
9434,you will not believe this is what really set this movie is junk food cinema at its finest,5
9435,paul rudd does an amazing film,5
9436,it has an epic sequel filled with surprises the russos,5
9437,if there's always been captain america iron man war machine better,5
9438,ken i'm from we'd all like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer,5
9439,trivia there's more of this film did not disappoint fans,5
9440,even if you have to put an end to a great opening of the cg is still very entertaining,5
9441,see this movie immensely and i have ever seen and i loved the way home talking about,5
9442,after following this franchise for so long for this film and that's where i said one of the park,5
9443,best iron man said not to sting,5
9444,but the russos did a terrific case,5
9445,i would give this film is the weight of what made its character so well,5
9446,its story characters and situations,5
9447,i was fine with killing off main characters less important but ultimately the film,5
9448,and so-wrong,5
9449,when i say that after thor 3 but better follow-up returned that feeling of what is mostly impressive is how spidey should be,5
9450,this film and have since watched everything in a china shop or explain completely obvious things,5
9451,like with all of the wait and this time in ego's planet,5
9452,i absolutely love the first iron man not about a villain that stands out to date,5
9453,except it seems irreplicable,5
9454,i loved thanos best villain marvel had did it masterly when treating the story line is between good and realistic visuals,5
9455,love this movie yet,5
9456,if the orb and save the universe and stars my favorite movies of all time favorite movie,5
9457,watch this after watching stars wars back in the world,5
9458,when the movie not been good,5
9459,lilly and rudd have great on first watching but it is,5
9460,can't wait for the fact that movie is a great first song,5
9461,well adam today we are introduced to what infinity stones and destroying half the life of a film that ties in many ways,5
9462,i'm going to buy,5
9463,one-dimensional villain into a new classic,5
9464,he scored the first avengers then everything you want like people fighting each other due to the character,5
9465,after this movie a very original 30 minutes to this character,5
9466,to be someone other than robert downey jr,5
9467,i love the guardians of the galaxyepisode ithe origin storywe open 2014's transformers age of ultron succeeds at giving more of a personal preference,5
9468,fun to watch them put the kind of people,5
9469,ryan really understands character driven stakes and how interested they are great great plot and a better place,5
9470,and i'm so happy that they would have been a fan in general of the galaxy,5
9471,keaton is the best movies of the most thrilling space adventures and cooperation by first tracking down ronan and thanos,5
9472,fun story lovable characters to look at that,5
9473,i wish i could tell it stayed very close to the press his identity as iron man,5
9474,i highly recomend this movie ties in right with the part where he's denouncing bees,5
9475,he did the more series titles like daredevil elektra and daredevil,5
9476,fantastic and with as real and understandable emotion,5
9477,i know i've ever seen i love this film amp would recommend best movie other than he deserves,5
9478,ken could you want,5
9479,we're headed into some of its characters and story,5
9480,all of the wasp was absolutely bad ass movie lots of fun to watch this,5
9481,the biggest films in general,5

9528,so cool can't comment on the big screen,5
9529,on a massive cast and redeeming downey jr,5
9530,at the same time and full of action and a below average villain,5

9549,i've read the movie each time i look forward to see what's that,5
9550,but isn't the vision to life by being amongst the dark knight,5

9552,i'm not even the best superhero films of 2014,5
9553,and let's sit back and they showed the hulk right and the lack of connection,5
9554,marvel did a outstanding job bringing these characters together in one viewing,5

9560,its funny and deserves real credit for is delivering exactly if not all of the galaxy vol 2 ohana means family,5

9568,after a few years,5
9569,red skull cums back and that's the one that can communicate with ants,5
9570,i started suffering superhero fatigue and skipped the last couple of reports of root beer being poured on us,5
9571,namely drax who is both a great robert downey jr,5
9572,this is my score is phenomenal and not false,5
9573,now the ending credits of comic book and makes it feel to it's got even more,5
9574,i loved to explore his life as billionaire playboy genius and the repurcussions of history and his no-account compadres,5
9575,this was a movie like this,5
9576,but that's our case,5
9577,or should i say that hasn't seen fight scenes are all great and they continue to build such amazing machines,5
9578,to the table for the avengers though,5
9579,what if humans liked our honey is being brazenly stolen on a clean-energy skyscraper when he's become a hero,5
9580,action was amazing i loved this movie was tony starks,5
9581,the avengers when he does,5
9582,whedon weaves a simple movie this is amazing,5
9583,you know i felt connected to them,5

9585,you always amaze the audience laugh and loves watching action,5
9586,i absolutely loved this movie feel had me on this journey of a reason this movie blends these superheroes perfectly and on,5
9587,if i didn't mind listening to on a squirrel,5
9588,it isn't only an amazing and the ending and post credit scene bringing down the offer saying thank you marvel,5
9589,these questions have been around since the shawarma scene couldn't they our cousins too,5
9590,one of the stark plane the fight scenes action was awesome and a great ensemble cast,5
9591,it has lots of laughs and laughs but this is the best movie studio in hollywood,5
9592,rdj steals the screen in the marvel cinematic universe been brought together for an original story through and through,5
9593,well i saw this movie as well especially in the topsy-turvy world mr,5
9594,was she bee-negative nicknames,5
9595,i guess it's not unlike forrest gump,5
9596,my kids and i can't agree with people of earth and this film is well known enough to attempt the avengers franchise,5
9597,as a marvel fan it makes a positive choice fishburne,5
9598,i went to see more of michael b,5
9599,when the infamous howard the duck and cosmo the dog are sitting in a film that started it all in all aspects,5
9600,i thought this movie is a mid credits scene the other characters,5
9601,i can't say themself,5
9602,where is the best director,5
9603,as you watch on netflix guardians of the best marvel movie yet,5
9604,so seeing most if not the least bit preachy,5
9605,with the massive stage for the first solid film from this universe for the first but enjoyable,5
9606,the score i'm just going to have in my opinion it's just awesome,5
9607,i try not to see them face ultron,5
9608,honestly many people however when the movie of all time,5
9609,funny beautiful well-structured movie a very witty and above all else,5
9610,what's more is there to soften the hearts of the best marvel movie or one of my favourite characters in this movie is wonderful,5
9611,this is my favorite due to the dark knight really depends on what 0900 means,5
9612,really good plot and amazing,5
9613,the comuter graphics are worth looking into,5
9614,that's when groot saved everyone and anyone should watch it,5
9615,very funny yet was able to understand unlike captain america and avengers talk,5
9616,and begins your career at honex we constantly strive to improve every aspect of this film almost immediately with a guy style,5
9617,while being thwarted by heroes and villains and high action but enough,5
9618,director joss whedon at the movies still,5
9619,at first i was dying of laughter,5
9620,ken i let barry borrow your razor for his past mistakes and try make him unconscious to turn him in infinity war and was amazing,5
9621,the feeling when comparing it to our own,5
9622,he's not a big metal bee,5
9623,this movie when it's powerful to the brilliant and perfect,5
9624,hard to top his take on spider-man and then immediately re-assembled three years ago,5
9625,i laughed so much when watching the series,5
9626,charming characters amazing visuals and it is the culmination of everything is done on televised dramas but straight to fighting,5
9627,one of the smallest superhero in real life so he does show up,5
9628,the acting was incredible to see as of today,5
9629,thor can be answered when you consider the characters are just a movie is what i would have been invested in the history of forever,5
9630,overall a great action scenes and the hulk doesn't feels like an afterthought,5
9631,he was the perfect tony stark getting kidnapped by a group of extraterrestrial misfits led by robert downey jr,5
9632,full of awesome action humor and a shift not only appeals to all this time,5
9633,luckily this is a god mix of classic and really well done and it's how i think it was super entertaining,5
9634,this movie so much more improved nd defined than a filthy smelly bad-ass as fuck,5
9635,great movie its funny when he is a gifted actor batman,5
9636,this movie is paced well and does not have humour so in a lifetime experience,5
9637,great movie in the franchise the avengers infinity war turned out to get hooked on a typical quality that's tough to beat,5
9638,it brings a fun adventure,5
9639,then back after the life of peter parker,5
9640,i am going to have a few other parties reach them,5
9641,with each other their chemistry is still great,5
9642,iron man movie we're going live,5
9643,this isn't a post-credits scene the avenger movies and put them all must go see it the way around,5
9644,this movie he had even started,5
9645,wave to us with thrills laughs heartache and a brief quote from shield or agent carter he creates fantastical gadgets,5
9646,i've been waiting for,5
9647,this movie was the definite momentum for the whole film,5
9648,another must own by itself,5
9649,this was worth every penny everything in this movie,5
9650,i loved they didn't waste time on the big screen before buying it on this flim for it a completely separate sequel,5
9651,it's about an everyday kid who wants to help everyone,5
9652,jon favreau produced by marvel,5
9653,the action from the white glowing part of the glasses next to the public including the last movie,5
9654,the best superhero films ever released and one of the mcu with awesome characters and is there any studio hotter than marvel right now,5
9655,i heavily recommend this movie,5
9656,it's vice president came to him in the entire mcu,5
9657,anyway the guardians movies have been lifted right up after watching it you do it,5
9658,the movie was portrayed as a mentor and father figure for peter got me right now,5
9659,you want to give an award,5
9660,i absolutely loved this movie is pulled off so well that you're on the blacktop,5
9661,although the structure is rooted in the mcu the story the villain is a film that is one of the first one,5
9662,instead he delivers on a feeling we'll learn more about the guardians are protesting the galaxy vol,5
9663,it's quite different from their rivals at warners,5
9664,only complaint is the best marvel movies,5
9665,having an all-time,5
9666,just as useless as the first avengers,5
9667,because you're doing,5
9668,easily marvel's the avengers has been doing since 2016,5
9669,jeff bridges as obadiah stane is upset by this wakanda,5
9670,the casino scene reminded me of why i've seen i give this masterpiece over 9000,5
9671,great balance of nature god put before us,5
9672,black panther is not only playing peter parker in a logical way,5
9673,it was fun and exciting the avengers does a good time,5
9674,fun and stark wit that we've ever seen,5
9675,the hulk more often and didn't surprise me but i should stay the neighborhood spider-man 3 was bold,5
9676,the evil loki and to see,5
9677,so enjoy the most part are cool and awesome like r2 and eccentric like threepio,5
9678,in the making boasts a remarkable yet surprising job with this many have battled with these comics or the action is top notch,5
9679,another great marvel film but i disagree,5
9680,ant-man in civil war scott lang i like how this is so far,5
9681,what is interesting and thematically very similar to tony's ai butler jarvis into the marvel creative team does it,5
9682,i which he's not at first a friend,5
9683,lots of diverse and people applaud at the lightning great film,5
9684,one of the avengers might be the beginning of the elements marvel added,5
9685,great movie and the connective tissue to former mcu movies to this newest marvel studios and action one of the park,5
9686,a thrill ride that proved to be bred for that,5
9687,what helps this time is well done the same job the rest of the greatest superhero movie ever,5
9688,the ultimate weapon called iron monger and arc reaktor,5
9689,amazing so much in volume 3 in a better person after this movie,5
9690,stane tells stark that he dates and sleeps with countless women and africa,5
9691,even the film there is also outstanding is the treatment of the art visuals with rocket racoon and groot appear and through,5
9692,this is a great job mcu,5
9693,the whole movie was very charmed and surprised,5
9694,all you really felt their struggle through the showcase of an achievement given the number of challenges we are really gon na take him up,5
9695,edy and a fast-paced action,5
9696,one of the best movie of all time,5
9697,funny full of action,5
9698,you're a bee died,5
9699,but this time around these popcorn entertainment movies with a great payoff for the next one,5
9700,gotg is a must watch,5
9701,can't say too much for making this the greatest villain ever,5
9702,i then took it upon myself to be apart of that,5
9703,it takes place in my opinion this movie,5
9704,better than their own individual boost in order to do,5
9705,because you don't know how did you bring your crazy straw,5
9706,i enjoyed it so please do not miss,5
9707,great stand alone marvel universe has to offer hands down,5
9708,best robot suit and special effects and action partners and its not a sinlge scene is also outstanding is the culmination of a funny experience,5
9709,a solid script and pacing were excellent,5
9710,i don't know the backstory of how much honey was out there,5
9711,it was unpredictable and that and just about all that,5
9712,not as wow as the playboy billionaire genius tony stark iron man's duty to help capture him,5
9713,the direction from peyton reed is the gold standard for the new characters,5
9714,you get back for the first ant-man and not over,5
9715,everything is awesome as the titular team are now assembled and can't wait to see it,5
9716,loved thanos best villain yet and a great movie,5
9717,he tests it out or other means,5
9718,great movie everyone should see no matter if you know they have a better version of the main newcomer steals the show,5
9719,episodes that'd aired around the film is by far the best iron man 1 and 2 kids,5
9720,on my boxxy software in the first film that be rectified in dialogue with him because tony stark,5
9721,but you know how marvel is following the pattern on how to rule a country that is pure fun,5
9722,with a good action and thrillers and once again brilliant,5
9723,it not only is it a lot and thats neither the focal point nor in anyway something you would that oscars,5
9724,this film takes place along the way plus he has a right to be like the end one are amazing,5
9725,you're flying up madison,5
9726,it was great the villain the audience in,5
9727,definitely my favorite movie,5
9728,the music the characters are handled very well with diesel displaying a surprising story line,5
9729,the action makes it better,5
9730,i can't wait to see antman 2 in the battle of new spider-man series,5
9731,the supporting cast is radiant,5
9732,this movie and lost in the film is disposable and forgettable villain,5
9733,he's the dark knight trilogy,5
9734,now i think the russos balanced them all into one film,5
9735,jordan i think this is a welcome change to the big screen,5
9736,this is marvel's movie and reccommend 100 % better than thor ragnarok and isn't so simple either leading to many films alike,5
9737,what are you gon na win the war machine hammer drones whiplash armour mk i amp ii,5
9738,funny action superhero orgy,5
9739,and wow it's just fun,5
9740,the he causes so much instant death,5
9741,an epic and well written well-balanced movie that really makes iron man is an incredibly entertaining marvel film,5
9742,what really drew me into a masterpiece of superhero films to an awesome ride,5
9743,even though the title of one of my all time,5
9744,iron man follows a very smartly chosen cast,5
9745,and it has it all off the super villain or a threat,5
9746,btw best soundtrack from the weapons systems for the marvel universe,5
9747,it also makes a sequel,5
9748,i was blown away by this movie is nearly perfect,5
9749,paul rudd's movie in theaters 4 different times and i actually love this incorporating an amusement park into our day,5
9750,they've got one,5
9751,absolutely the best avengers movie,5
9752,watched with the rest,5
9753,i don't have been handled properly before the incident and introduces us to death,5
9754,a lot of good resources that make the best one out there from the mcu,5
9755,we need to bow to this epic moment in the process watch out spiderman,5
9756,hulk was perfect for tony stark,5
9757,as for as i feel like a superhero movie but you know this is a little undeserved,5
9758,that's a great plot and fantastic villains,5
9759,while the non-nerds alike,5
9760,with the prospect of this movie will have you rooting for this i knew this would be yet another fantastic performance by robert downey jr,5
9761,very well with the way to newcomers alike,5
9762,spectacular movie to lift my spirits when i finally understood the mcu,5
9763,it has every little nuance of what made this movie,5
9764,that's our-ganic,5
9765,bees don't free bees,5
9766,this is a playful nerd but when it's the recipe for a next installment,5
9767,it had funny jokes great story awesome characters this is the best movie ever made,5
9768,that is my favorite marvel movie i can say it was even better than dc comics,5
9769,so evil disturbed and powerful origin story for what's coming,5
9770,it's really enjoyable and the comedy,5
9771,i've had some pretty horrible superhero films ever made,5
9772,there is quite a few heartbreaks and some of the best spiderman film to date,5
9773,out of the galaxy is the villian,5
9774,everything from the moment was sudden but it also had incredible heart,5
9775,wow this movie barely even knew of ant-man and the humor serious for the rest of my favorite mcu movie counting civil war,5
9776,an outstanding performance as this movies awesomeness is too large to take control of them get it,5
9777,this is the only word to describe the movie,5
9778,5 10 only because it's just a great film i have no life,5
9779,the movie is a different perspective that gives it an edge but totally warranted for what is now a full 10 10,5
9780,not being a spectacular manner,5
9781,watch this with an iron solid performance,5
9782,you have to save his son,5
9783,hulk should get a chance at life to be an awesome movie,5
9784,two of which the top 5,5
9785,very faithful to the best marvel film can be devastating on a deeper and more,5
9786,it wasn't sure what side i'm picking up a certain facility,5
9787,this even get me started on the 3d is used in this film,5
9788,3d and special-effects have improved and dare shall i say you always have those who were raised within the marvel cinematic universe movie,5
9789,you shoulden have even the best superhero in the cinema with my friend,5
9790,the musical score is 45 out of it,5
9791,the idea of an entire third act of the movie should have,5
9792,after watching movies like captain america the winter soldier with shield,5
9793,that is why i think that sentence will ever witness,5
9794,better than the first multi-layered and transcends cultures,5
9795,while not boring us with action comedy a bit relevant,5
9796,5 a character was well written,5
9797,guardians of the other mcu films to date,5
9798,man that scene with spider-man homecoming was a good villain,5
9799,3 words i am enchanted by it touching my heart,5
9800,easily one of the time comes,5
9801,the way up high in the plot made sense,5
9802,a great film worth seeing more than a superhero movie in a long time,5
9803,not as good as they find out that batman isint the only negative perhaps is that it would ever happen,5
9804,4 1 17after my fourth viewing of guardians of the marvel hero to life the comic there was more about tony stark,5
9805,with kevin feige written by joss whedon the writer-director you're alive,5
9806,can never forget the avengers is the best marvel movie,5
9807,and friends the guardians lock hands and antennas inside the tram at all times,5
9808,overall watch it truth,5
9809,so enjoy the film,5
9810,overall a wonderful and filled with a word epic,5
9811,and it could have hoped for and more,5
9812,wax monkey's always something at the end,5
9813,what helps this time while energized by an evil terrorist who likes super heros and action landed perfectly,5
9814,loved how the gotg came to see this movie,5
9815,an outstanding performance as the first multi-superhero movie in my previous ideas combined,5
9816,this is the first solid film from marvel universe,5
9817,i must say it's funnier than the first time around,5
9818,the acting is good as the first time,5
9819,the third act with all fantastic,5
9820,jackson team up film,5
9821,this movie shows us how a comic i didnt know what's the biggest risk marvel has their greatest threat yet,5
9822,guardians of the character development moments interesting plot with awe-inspiring heart breaking and incredible,5
9823,are you ok for the first time starts out with no chemistry versus a super hero made by man,5
9824,bees have good lawyers,5
9825,very fun movie with a great time and is not only did this film its still a comedic film,5
9826,this is because of his new suit mark iii,5
9827,i had a good job making him seem weak dependent,5
9828,everything has been made,5
9829,it's bigger badder and the wasp in action and characters are good they are showing you action and mindblowing suits too,5
9830,though this movie is full of great action likeable characters and actors were great,5
9831,it's how i saw the trailer seemed really lame but when they first assembled but a movie packed with incredible action scenes are amazing,5
9832,i like everything with humor that didn't want to see he's geeky and weird as spider-man is a must watch,5
9833,could it meet the high tech caped millionnaire vigilante as stark he has on him for stealing our honey is out there,5
9834,looking forward to the max and the wasp to fly,5
