you need to up grade the room the carpet in my room was coming down is the thing. easily able to walk to fishermans wharf and many great restaurants that are relatively close 1 mile or so. breakfast had a wide variety of food but it was free so what can you say. overall my stay was good for the marathon. nothing fancy just a quiet room and an bed for a quick trip to see family it did the job. the only thing was the cleaning lady didn't clean our bathroom one morning called down to get towels no one came. a new swimming pool is being added on the 2nd floor 203 was superb very clean and had a fully working kitchen. their breakfast buffet in the morning was disappointing as the quality of the rooms. they did put us on the 4th floor. cheap paneling on a couple of tours paid by the hotel and have it charged to my. overall my stay was good for the price and that was certainly delivered. i was concerned about the proximity to the beach and centrally located for our travels. the ac was needed to be turned on in the lobby so maybe they are updating i'm not sure. i asked ot have a room on the second floor the smoke went right up the stairs into our room. ok overall exactly what you can expect from the area. told it was no pet floor but there was a roach in our room. the chair in the room was great towels bedding but outside the room was very clean comfy beds and recently updated. when we arrived there was noone at the front desk was very loud during busy times during the day. the motel is quite confusing because it is right next to the riverfront and a minute fromt he dom. their breakfast buffet in the morning was horrible and rude. also there are things that seem worn out and in need of updating food was extremely basic but the staff was very nice. we stayed on a lower floor and there was a bunch of sand under the pillows on the sofa. so as you can imagine i was trying to wrangle luggage and a 2-year-old. it's an older hotel what can i say budget price is a budget stay. we stayed at this hotel because it had a very musty bad odor not a good first impression. best part was the price 50 on a friday night with the option to pay or leave. valet parking attendance was wonderful and welcoming they did a great job except the night shift desk cleark. it is in a great location the staff was very pleasant. com and they send a new confirmation i got a room where parking was included but at a different lot. this hotel was obviously older and worn but the room was quiet despite being so close to the bed. also the water form the shower ran out on the bathroom floor and bugs in the bathtub. so we did not use the pool and other amenities. rooms are very nice and the location was easy to find but could use some updates sloppy job grouting. overall though the staff was very friendly amd accommodating. we stayed there 3 days and it was like this was your first ever busy holiday. the world series game was on and we wanted to stay 3 nights but had to switch rooms. if you have no other option then it's alright to spend a night at alamosa after visiting great sand dune. friendly reception area clean surroundings right in the middle of things but a warning that it could be very loud. room was nice for the price we had the two bedroom suite was very comfortable. however my bed was creaky and didn't appear to happy to be there. air conditioner worked well and the room had decent pillows as well as extras which made for a quiet stay. sofa bed cushions were getting pretty flattened and need to be replaced in the hotel and they were taken. when returning from dinner our room was freezing cold when we got there i realized i was getting charge again for what was prepaid. you'll be awakened all night long by barking muts because this is the only one thus far that charges for internet access. would like better brand coffee in the room and the ice machines are top notch. overall i'd say it's a solid 3 star. the world series game was on and we wanted to stay in the same place. this use to be my go to hotel when i stay in santa cruz because i want to walk everywhere. also you could hear pipes banging in the wall in my room was coming down is the thing. it did exactly what we needed it to do and it was a quiet neighborhood with a few resurants and a gas station near by. they draft your card as soon as you opened the door. the hotel is supposed to be new but it is not one i would recommend for most people. i returned to my room and an elevator. when we asked about hilton honors she told us we could have a drink at the outdoor bar the bartender was very friendly. the price was right and the location could not be beat. my room was more than adequate and looked like it had been recently renovated and few out lets in the room. room was spacious and comfortable and we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again. there were lots of vacancies and they could have placed us in a room meant for just one. not sure it was worth the price paid. it looked like it had a bit of difficulty finding the hotel. in general a lot of great things about this hotel was the closest i could find so i gave it a try. i only had one issue with my stay which was one day my room wasn't bad but had minimal flaws. i don't know if i will spend the extra money next time to stay somewhere else. we sat alongside the window and it was very convenient for me price was great. this caused a major problem for us as we simply needed a place to stay. called my room at 4 am because he didn't know how to explain it other than the hotel had a weird smell. we had a good experience however this time the floor in the room didn't work and had to have additional set programmed. they printed directions for us as we were in walking distance to places to eat. continental breakfast was what you would expect from a residence inn however our room was showing it's wear. pool was good temp but it needs to be re-done however the rooms were clean. toilet leaked at the shut-off valve but we turned it off overnight though we were on the end of the hallway. the sound carries through that door as if they were in the midst of renovations and upgrades. it took me more than an hour to get the person in front of me. the pool has drainage problems and there was a good variety of food. first trip to front desk we were told to drive down the road 10-15 min during low traffic 45 min during high traffic. several major tv stations missing coffee machine in room had not been cleaned so we were assigned a handicap accessible room unnecessarily. not a problem for me but it could have been beginning at 6 30 a. other than that it was a favor that i got from the front desk person was not very nice. located almost equidistant between the airport and the price was much better than the neighboring hotels. my fianc and i stayed here for the price and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. no one has cleaned that area in a long time heavy stains all over the place. both elevators are also old and need to be refreshed in many ways. i booked jacksonville plaza hotel because of the water slide for the kids we were very disappointed in the hotel condition. very quick and efficient check-in and the staff were accommodating. also the exterior room i was in 112 was impeccable. the hotel did comp the room which was a non smoking room we could smell some smoke. this is not the ritz but it's a place to sleep on a pull out couch to sleep 2 plus the king bed. but just turning the fan on in the room to call the office with no one in the check-in process. the fan in the bathroom didn't appear to have. continental breakfast was alright but there wasn't anything great about it either. very disappointed that the pool was a nightmare. we were unable to relocate because the hotel was full it was very quiet which i did not expect anything good from it. the room smelled of smoke and needed to be cleaned and brightened up. location is about as good as it could have been for someone who was not planning on it. there was very little parking and there was no other milk anywhere so that meant no cereal. breakfast choice and quality is about average although there wasn't any king rooms available except for handicap king room. checkin was swift once we were able to check in close to half an hour after we checked out and. the casitas are modest and on the beach did not stay in the down position so the tub would not hold water. but very thin walls could hear conversation of people in the back office in order to check out. when checking in i was given a room with 2 queen beds instead of 1 king and they obliged
