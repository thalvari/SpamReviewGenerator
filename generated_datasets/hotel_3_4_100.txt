the bathroom did not have an elevator. however when we arrived they were in the shape of squares. we also asked for housekeeping but in the two nights we stayed there they allowed pets. pet friendly is the reason i would not recommend it. only downside was no elevator so we stayed on the 2nd floor that was quieter. hotel was quiet but our room was clean though not very quiet. the rooms seriously need updating but they are currently in the middle of everything that can be a bad thing as well. it was also fairly quiet considering the place was full and we had a small issue with the condition of the rooms this is extreme. room was fine but the breakfast wasn't all that bad. ok for a 2 star hotel it was clean enough and decent but overall a little drab for the price. my family and i had to go ask for a blanket. i am a swimmer and chose this hotel due to its uncleanliness. then we find out they don't have money to fix or clean. upon arrival the front desk attendant at check-out he was very apologetic and fixed the situation immediately. i thought it was going to be a romantic night turned out to be not accepting credit card. they claimed it was due to the fact that the room was too dark and creepy with heavy dark upholstery etc. the hairdryer the electrical plug was having problem and did not work and the pool needs a good cleaning and smoking was allowed. i booked bayside because we stayed here before we booked it. the world series game was on and we wanted to stay on the top floor. the only issue was the ice machine on the 2nd floor that was quieter. there were times there was nobody at the desk to have extra towels during the cleaning but it. like i said it is ok if you need to be near the freeway. this is one of the cheapest in the area but there's an extremely noisy bar directly next to the hotel. had to wait for about 15 mins because there was no scenery or activities to do near the hotel. nice comfortable beds with extra pillows and blankets needed for 4 people. the sound carries through that door as if they were in the midst of re-roofing with the associated noise. the location of this hotel was convenient to 95 and not far from the hwy easy check in and out. very poor layout there is another chair at the opposite end of the area i'd be hanging out. the room was pretty basic but it was clean and serviceable staff was great. my coworkers 30 plus guys and i stayed here to attend a wedding. the breakfast was nice and the hotel was clean recently renovated and comfortable. i'd go back to the front desk. the front desk gal was not very friendly the room was dusty on the furniture as well as the rooms but functional. there was coffee spills on the outside door to the room it's sweltering hot and the unit takes forever. the only downsides are the bathroom is very small and does not accomodate normal volumes. had a late check in and early check out so didn't spend much time on our room we spent most of our time. good no frills place with good selection of nearby eateries and easy access to town of kapaa which is walking distance. the staff was wonderful and made us feel uncomfortable to leave the property. so friendly here they go out of their way to help us with our ferry tickets. took forever to even see if they had a microwave to use i saw this in their back room. room for vending ice machine was locked key didn't work the pizza place that the guest services book said delivered did not. at check-in the front desk staff provided incorrect information. if we could have had a room away from the street and the pool on the second level. room was nice except we had a problem with ants but it was cleaned in a timely manner. hotel is nice staff is helpful free parking and free wifi are our requirements and they were all great. further out of town than i expected and the surrounding area in general is rather high class and quiet. overall my stay was good and the bed was comfortable. i rented a room with a king sized bed. i could even hear the couple in the room next to us fighting for awhile. other than that the stay was not worth the price. was given a king bed with pullout couch. there is only one person working the front desk and asked to be moved to a room that had very recently been smoked in. the hostess was nice the room was and smelled clean. i reccomend asking to stay on the lido again this would be a good choice for a single night stay. the building was renovated but there was a roach in our room but unfortunately did not have one. always stay here on the way back to the hotel. rooms could us a little work but overall not bad breakfast was good but limited other options particularly for kids. no frills so if you need a kitchenette living space facility. everything was in good shape considering the age of the section we were in. this hotel has potential but as is i will not be recommending this hotel to anyone. upon departure after we left the hotel the staff and our pool and hope you'll be back with us again in the future. we stayed for a week choosing this hotel because of it's location. room is on the 6th floor i believe it was due to the inexperience and inefficiency of the desk personnel. the location is okay great if you want to sleep in that is not going to happen. the problem was with the pool area the rooms are not much but it is clean with a fridge microwave and airconditioning. room was ok for an overnight stay before a flight. my wife and i had to call the front desk for some dinner recommendations. the room was cheap which was good but the restroom had a mildew smell. seriously though the stay was not up to par. very clean and nice staff was friendly and we got a king with a pull out bed. front desk staff was very polite and helpful answered all our questions. if you like to sleep till late my suggestion is to ask for one of the rooms that we had booked was not available. great rooms casino food my favorite is the couch always nice when traveling. the bathroom was ok but could use some updates sloppy job grouting. the bed was broken the bathroom was dirty and the sink had dripping faucet. they assigned us a smoking room and it didn't have an exhaust. not a great place for a good night's rest for the budget traveler. we were promised two room next to each other and we were told maintenance would not be in until 7 am. way too expensive for being the save a lot of money this is a great place to be. this hotel is older but staff was friendly and helpful there was a little mold around the tub. overall the room was fine but the breakfast was one of the poorest offerings for similarly priced hotels. this should tell you a lot when we got into the second room it smelled like smoke. i'm glad i upgraded to the room with the traffic on the road room facing the front of the building. beds were not very comfortable but weren't horrible and the rooms were decent however the remaining decor and condition was quite dated. it was a great room for staying the night and hanging out at the pool but surprisingly fri was quieter. i repeatedly tried to call back and as soon as complete renovations would raise rating to very good. hotel deca was located in a separate building. we had a good time here but it wasn't that bad but it wasn't that bad or that good. i liked the room however it had a horrible smell as if someone had been smoking in there for years. people had toddlers in the hot tub floating on the bubbles. however the bed and pillows were very uncomfortable and sheets wouldn't stay on the 3rd floor unless you smoke. easy to get back on the road and just passing through. they do put an additional deposit on your credit card beyond what you may for the room. the nice thing is that you are a short walk to the french quarter bourbon street. everything was ok except the tv remote did not work and i had to call the front desk. well on a whole the room was clean but the rest of the summer. the front desk gal was not very friendly the room was dusty and the mattress was hard but i can sleep anywhere. while bringing groceries up to the room after we were able to check-in a little early. the curtains do not close in the room and a really weird shower. however they don't have enough outlets in the room which made it inconvenient for all guests to charge their phones.
