0,3, Loud and gory just what you want from a predator film. Enjoyable and easily able to sit back and just watch the carnage.
1,5," I went in not expecting much, but found that it was very enjoyable and even had some really funny parts. If you enjoy the predator movies, you'll enjoy this. it's a predator movie. I really don't understand why they didn't make thomas jane the main character though. that would have been a wise casting decision."
2,3, A good movie with some decent action and kills. Although it was a little boring between kills.
3,5," Not sure what the problem is. It's a movie about an alien hunter, hunting humans. Humans find innovative ways to fight back.<br/><br/>There's humor and action. It's awesome. <br/><br/>If you can only get in the mood for art house dramas, find a different director, genre, series, and direction in life.<br/><br/>Kidding aside, there was plenty to appreciate in the exploration of mental health issues and autism. I've never seen so much light and depth given to truly insane characters ('the loonies') , who in the real world, we often forget are still people."
4,0," This movie was the Predator franchise's last chance of coming into good graces with the public, and this movie has made the fans of the franchise hate the movies now. The movie has a plot twist that made no sense. SPOILERS The smaller Predator is hunted down by the larger Predator because the smaller one is wanting to prepare humans for an eventual Predator invasion. However, the smaller Predator throughout the movie is killing people, therefore defeating the purpose of wanting to save humanity. In the movie they touch on Autism, claiming it's the next step in evolution. But in the same movie they make fun of an army soldier who has teurette syndrome. Also at the end of the movie there's a weapon that is named the Predator Killer, however the Predators have never in any source material referred to themselves as Predators. Their species name is Yautja, but it was the Predators who apparently made and named this piece of technology, so take that as you will. The saddest part of the movie is that people will pay money to see the movie to find out if it's bad or not"
5,3, is a funny movie but in not serius in the moments of she need it
6,3," I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. The comedy and actors were great. Would be 4 stars, but the ending was a bit corny."
7,4," Although there were aspects of this script that could have been improved upon I left the theater feeling entertained and content with the movie itself, in fact I've been to see it a total of three times. Throughout the film I was left laughing, crying and gripping the edge of my seat. The graphics were very well done and the atmosphere was very well set. I would absolutely recommend that anyone go see this movie."
8,0," La peor pelicula que he visto en todo el año, no por sus fallas de logica o efectos, puedo perdonar mucho mas; pero cometio el mayor pecado que una pelicula puede cometer, es aburrida."
9,0, Should've been a direct to DVD movie.
10,3," entertaining, some suspense and action. poor acting and alot of ""F' usage, could have developed the characters more . overall a good sci fi a thriller and the ending was good."
11,0, How can such a simple concept require completely re-writing to give motivations totally inconsistent with established lore. Mauler sums it up perfectly.
12,4, The Rotten Tomatoes review is totally HOSED. Just saw the movie and loved it.. The action was great and it put a whole new spin on the purpose of the predator visits. Something that I think the Predator fans would appreciate. Time well spent.
13,0," Worst move I have seen in a long time. The acting by almost all the actors was horrendous. Not sure if it was lack of talent or bad writing. The language was way over the top as well. There is no need for that many F bombs in one movie. Even the little kid was cursing. That really shows a lack of talent in the writers. Instead of going to see this movie, take $10 and flush it down the toilet. You will save yourself an hour and 44 minutes of your life."
14,1," The Predator was one of the most astonishingly ill-conceived movie reboots I've seen. It retains almost none of the aspects that make the original predator interesting as well as writing the movie in the completely wrong genre.<br/><br/>This movie tries to emulate a marvel movie in tone and pace rather than use the horror genre which it is more suited to and the change is especially jarring given the uniqueness of the predator. <br/><br/>Rather than using stealth, guile and agility to harass large groups of heavily armed soldiers with traps and hit and run tactics these predators lose their camouflage, simply tank the bullets and walk slowly towards their victims like some sort of extraterrestrial Mike Meyers. Couple this with the wise cracking buddy cop feel of the protagonists and any semblance of the terrifying cat and mouse game with an unseen alien of the classic films vanishes. <br/>That enough would be enough to make this movie not enjoyable but the movie also suffers from one dimensional characters, bizarre awkward dialog, and an outlandish insensitive plot.<br/><br/>The only reason for giving this one star is it contains two of the most unintentionally hilarious movie moments I've ever seen. one is the demise of one of the antagonists played by Sterling K. Brown, and the other is the final scene between Thomas Jane and Keegan-Michael Key. <br/>If you've seen the movie you know exactly which scenes I mean.<br/><br/>Now for the elephant in the room. The movie portrays autism, a condition which causes many people lifelong hardship, as a super power and then forgets that the child with autism has it immediately after introduction of it as the child portrays remarkable poise and insight during traumatic scenarios with brand new people. If this is what autism was really like its no wonder that predators want to steal it for their genome. There are certainly high functioning autistic people who have achieved a lot but this is in spite of their autism not because of it."
15,4," Surprisingly entertaining! I enjoyed this much more than I thought I would. Laughed out loud a bunch of times. I usually hate Hollywood action movies, but this was a fun little ride."
16,1, Please DEVOLVED the hunt...
17,5," This movie was a great squeal from the original picture. They not only included the old plot, but the way they built off of it was great, sure it wasn't the greatest written movie of all time but the solder aspect added with the aspect of family was a great touch, not to mention the awesome S.F.X they had! 10/10 will watch again!"
18,3," The Predator is directed by Shane Black, written by Fred Dekker and Shane Black and starring Boyd Holbrook, Trevante Rhodes, Keegan-Michael Key and Olivia Munn.<br/><br/>It's all about the outer reaches of space to the small-town streets of suburbia, the hunt comes home in Shane Black's explosive reinvention of the Predator series. Now, the universe's most lethal hunters are stronger, smarter and deadlier than ever before, having genetically upgraded themselves with DNA from other species. When a young boy accidentally triggers their return to Earth, only a ragtag crew of ex-soldiers and a disgruntled science teacher can prevent the end of the human race.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge fan of Predator, I love their costumes and the CGI, but this franchise didn't do that much for me, it didn't impress me that much.<br/><br/>The Predator is not disappointing for me as lots of people said it is, cause simply I'm a fan of the first Predator movie, but The Predator wasn't that good, it has lots of thing that had no sense!<br/><br/>Let's start with the things I liked about this movie... I liked the costumes very very much, they were really cool, and it's actually the most impressive thing about this movie. The CGI was really good too, but I have a problem with it too, the predators were showing up in the dark, the crew was just trying to hide something, like their mistakes so they made them show in the dark to make it looks perfect, predators showed only one time in the morning, and it was the final fight, and it was so short.. anyways, let's back to the things I liked, the story, I liked the story, it was good and the last thing I liked is the role of Jacob Tremblay, but it went in an another wrong way too!<br/><br/>Now with the things I hated about this movie... I will start with the CGI again, and as I said above the predators in the dark. I didn't notice any drop with the CGI, and of course that's what the crew wanted from us. I guess they were lazy to work hard, so they made them in the night, but then they showed them in the morning, and then I said ""Oh, you're capable to make an amazing CGI, but you were just lazy to do it!"".<br/><br/>Then let's move to the role of Jacob Tremblay, it was really good at the beginning, but then he actually turned into bad-acting. I hated how they made him insult and all of that stuff, I hated it!!<br/>The performances in general were bad, all of them were less than fine.<br/><br/>I hated the predator dog so much, they made him a pet after a bullet in the head!!!! It bothered me so much!!!<br/><br/>The story was good as I said, but it was so slow, then so fast, it was really awkward!<br/>Because of that, it was boring.<br/><br/>The jokes were trash too, I don't know why they made it at the first place!<br/><br/>The Predator in general is fine, I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it too, I just liked it...<br/><br/>I'm gonna give The Predator a D.. I think it's a good movie, but it depends on what are you expecting to see, and I as expecting to see a movie that it's gonna break the first Predator movie, but unfortunately it didn't!<br/><br/>Thank you, guys as always for reading my review, hope you like, and if you have any comment, just say it."
19,2, Subpar and boring in almost every level with a lot of very stupid dialogue and action that is shot in the worst way possible.
20,1," One of the most legitimately stupid movies I have ever seen in my entire life. The humor is oppressively terrible and constantly obnoxious, the plot of the movie makes no sense, the characters are annoying, and it takes a dump on the Predator mythos from the previous movies. More than any movie I have seen in a while it comes across like the writers were complete and absolute morons"
21,4," I have no idea what these reviewers are thinking. As a fan of the series this was a great entry, with a cool story and awesome cast. Don't waste your time with the reviews, go and enjoy a great predator flick."
22,3," If you have enjoyed the previous Predator films then this is in the same vein and delivers what you would expect; some nice action sequences and some 'fluff' cinema. It doesn't pretend to be more than an 80s inspired action romp and that's what it delivers. It has jokes, violence, some mild gore and is an enjoyable almost 2hrs of watching."
23,3," It's a shoutout to old B-Rate films, i can't hate it! (Actually kinda liked it.) But throwing in a kid who's supposed to be on the spectrum as a plot device and having him act so inacurately, almost losing his disorder halfway through the movie, that kinda sucked. Same for the representation of PTSD. Save for a couple (very short) moments, the phrase seemed to be a placeholder for having them ""acting crazy."" Definitely worth seeing though. Like.. on blu-ray."
24,4," Buena acción y soundtrack, unos chistes regulares, pero un final estúpido.<br/>Una película palomera como the meg o rascacielos"
25,0, I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS GOT RELEASED. HONESTLY.
26,5, I don't understand all the negativity..... the movie over all is very entertaining. I love it
27,5, Movie was way way better then its predecessors.<br/>Story was slightly weak but overall cgi and action pulled it good.<br/>Hope they come up with sequel
28,1," Very disappointed in this film. The action scenes were great, but the poor writing and forced humor and puns killed it for me. I felt like they were trying to copy the witty humor of GoG or Deadpool but failed miserably. Dont waste your time if your expecting the classic Predator quality."
29,3, Not awful but not great. Some interesting parts.
30,3, Disappointing ending. Wish it was different......
31,5," If im being honest, i ADORE this movie, i went to see it at the theater with one of my friends and we both really enjoyed it, not sure if its just more appealing to us because we are younger, but i hope this movie gets a sequel where it can write alot of its wrongs and clear some of the mess its made up, but i will always stand for this movie, because i sat down, watched it and ate my pop-corn and came out with a huge smile on my face"
32,5," My husba.d and I went to see this. It was excellent. The actors are all talented. The action is continuous (no stopping for a star's close up) and the dialog is constant - no stopping the action for long winded rants. We plan to take our grandson who is 9. It is well done. The only, only complaint is that the writers seem to only know one adjective. That got old fast."
33,4," The best ""Predator"" so far. This movie was able to fulfill all that it had promised, this film had fantastic action scenes / fights, fabulous spice effects, great actors, a complex and fantastic plot (which is really good), a good soundtrack and some overpowering scenes. It's really a shame this movie has this kind of horrible rating, which only proves that today's critics do not know anything; If you want to criticize film, criticize movies to not good movies; Criticize movies with Star Wars Hollyday Special, Dragon Ball Evolution, Piranhaaconda, Sharknado, Jurassic Prey, Birdemic Shock and Terror or The Amazing Bulk. One of the best films of 2018. I highly recommend it."
34,1, Una basura. Personajes planos en exceso machos y un argumento que sucede por casualidad. Siento vergüenza por la ignorancia y los prejuicios con los que se trata el autismo en estos filmes. El Predator está reducido a merchandising.
35,5, Loved this movie!!! Everything a Predator movie should be and more!
36,1," If you want to see The Predator being chased down a road and shot at from a school bus, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, just watch the original, this one is a waste of time."
37,3, A fun little romp. Visual chewing gum.
38,0," Such anticipation. Such disappointment. Again, the opportunity to take potential and make it great was missed. What are people thinking when they think there's a chance putting this rubbish out there? There were parts of the film that had potential as a storyline but the childish approach to it and confusion that if you film it like Mavel movie it has to do well gets on my nerves......."
39,3," Se agradece el tono còmico en la direcciòn de Shane Blake y el reparto, pero fracasa al querer cambiar de estilos."
40,5, The movie was great the way the story was show was great
41,3," Totally derivative, but halfway fun. Only just halfway, though, not all the way."
42,5," Me encantó la película The Predator, espero que continúen la saga."
43,5," Great movie. Stop with the uppity bs, this movie does what it means to do, and for that it's a really good flick."
44,2," Not much to say, another reboot that went wrong."
45,0," What an utterly CRAP movie while trying to mimic the A-Team in resembling some of the characters, terrible script writing. The movie was terrible from start even all the way to the end of it. The kid's character is no doubt based off Sheldon's character in Big Ban Theory, and a Biologist that somehow thinks she is some Ace Warrior running after an Alien - Utter Crap while the main good guy somehow miraculously keeps surviving being hunted down by the Aliens. What is so stupid is the group of them keep narrowly being wiped, and then some how the have major rest times where they sit around joking &amp; drinking beers at a bar or that as if NOTHING major has happened. Also, the Alien's tech is immediately deciphered by the kid in how to use it, but the writers only excuse for that he has the ability to remember everything he sees except that doesn't explain how figures out Alien Tech.<br/><br/>Lastly, there is one Alien running away from another but the one chasing him the Writer makes him 3 times larger than the original Predator.<br/><br/>This movie is poorly written, directed &amp; produced I am amazed it was even allowed to be shown, but I guess they hoped to get their money back on this trash of a movie which is a modern day B Movie where it's SO bad it can't be true but it is..!"
46,4, made me remember back when predator first came out
47,3," The Predator feels like a puzzle missing lots of pieces and because of those missing pieces the movie just doesn't work. The cast is half ok and half bad because they feel like cardboard cutouts, they do there job but it feels lifeless with no emotions. The plot is also done in a very confusing way that does ruin the mood of the movie. One good aspect is the special effects that look interesting, they bring some life to the film."
48,1," So bad. The attempt at comedy was stale, the story was stale, the performances were stale... the screenplay sounded as if it were written by 5th graders and even the visual effects had a 'Star Trek: Next Generation' feel to them... do yourself a favor and watch something else."
49,0," I actually created an account just to leave this review. How could they have managed to do this to such a beloved franchise? It's like they saw Deadpool and said screw it, let's make that but with some aliens. It was ridiculous from start to finish."
50,1," What a waster of time and resources to make such a mess of a story. Alas, we keep waiting for a dignified sequel to the superb ""Predator""."
51,2, Meh....<br/>Stop trying to overthink it! The original predator was great because it had the suspense of the unknown for much of the movie while each person was gradually stalked with no real clue of what was really going on. Making a move with a vast predator conspiracy is just trying to do too much. You don't need to make larger stronger predators. Just stick to the basics of raw suspense immersed in good acting and story. In an attempt to make the movie more complex you've actually ended up dumbing it down.
52,3," This movie was a lot of fun! If you can accept this movie as a comedy, I think it a great watch. It is definitely not a perfect movie by any means. But, I enjoyed it more than Predators, which felt like a self-serious rehashing of the original. At least this film was very much its own. If you like Shane Black or a good comedy, you should definitely watch this movie. If you are expecting Arnold reborn, you are going to be sorely disappointed!"
53,0," What the hell was this. It started out fine, had the music the cool Predator then they ruined it by destroying everything the lore has built so far. Is this a real attempt to destroy Aliens and the Predator franchise?"
54,3," The ugly alien is back. So a Predator crash lands on Earth. A military operation is nearby, and a sniper (Boyd Holbrook) crosses paths with him. He survives, but gets written off as insane, and now he has to team up with a band of misfit crazy military types if he wants to stand any hope of saving the day. Now I like the Predator series, but I don't love it. With the exception of the Alien vs. Predator movies, I have seen all of the films, but they aren't something that I frequently rewatch or even movies that I hold in that high regard. I do, however, love me some Shane Black, and that is really got my attention about this: it is his writing and direction. Well, I will just go ahead and say: this isn't the movie that will save the series. Now I do think that it took me a really long time to begin to warm up to this. There is a really long wind-up, and while I may have been a bit on the tired side, I was largely bored with the opening 40 minutes of this. It wasn't really doing anything that I haven't already seen before, but after the first half or so, that is when this starts to show its true colors: this is a comedy. An action-comedy, sure, but most of the lines and actions are done for comedic effect. The theater I was in was almost completely empty, but for whatever reason, I had a couple sit right next to me. They reacted uproariously whenever this movie would go for it, and it did enhance my viewing experience, at least to a small degree. Even though I did get some enjoyment out of this, there was a lot of this that didn't really do it for me. The script gets weak at points, which is a shame, because that is what I watch a Shane Black movie for. Some jokes hit, but it really doesn't possess that snap that I was hoping for. It does get better once it becomes an ensemble piece, and it is not all bad, albeit always uneven. At least most of the kills are pretty cool, and I know that is the reason why some people are going to watch this. I think you have to make up your own mind on it, because I can see fans and non-fans alike either digging this or walking away angry."
55,3," It's not like the original, but it is it's own film. There are a fair amount of jokes and great actions. Just sit back and relax with a big bag of popcorn and don't think to much."
56,4," I enjoyed the performances by Olivia Munn, and the Mackenna boy. Lots of blood, gore and swearing."
57,4, good movie <br/>doesnt deserve the hate its getting!<br/>all action and pretty funny too
58,2, This franchise deserved better than a boring and obvious attempt to merely setup a sequel. Barely worth the watch.
59,4, This movie is really good!! It pay homage to the first movie but also sets up a potential new lore and the possibility of more Predator movies. The action in this movie is pretty non-stop and does well to showcase the Predator over just human combat. If you're a Predator fan you have to see this movie!
60,3," A good fresh addition that doesn't deserve the hate it's getting. What I like about this film is that it's very self aware, not trying to copy predator or its sequel where an alien come to earth to hunt, there's only so many hunting trips to earth you can do before it becomes too repetitive and less imaginative. The director said he wanted to make this an event film whilst honouring its predecessors and I think he succeeded. A simple plot but a good enough one which builds on the mythology of the yautja. Basically Predators have been trying to evolve themselves into better killers and there is a blood feud between the different clans who value honour in different ways. There are some nice Easter eggs referencing the previous films whilst trying to bring some new ideas to the table. A very fast paced film with snappy humour and nice action best pieces. This is a hard R and is easily the bloodiest/gory entry to the franchise. You can't keep living in the past and wanting the same formula as the first two films, it needs freshening up once a while and this film does it. It's not the best but the worst either just a different take on it, it's one of those films which may be more appreciated later on but gets a pass from me. ??"
61,2, verry poor movie ! :-(
62,3," Not what I was expecting! Funny, action packed and gory with a bizarre tone. Nothing special but very entertaining."
63,4, Good movie....looking forward to the sequel
64,5," Why this will be known as the best of the Predator films. 1. Script is loaded with homages to the original. 2. Story connects with abducted humans trying to find a way back to Earth. 3. The actors give the film an approachable reality. 4. This film has finally offered a true glimpse to some real issues of military members with PTSD, and coincides with September's POW month. SEE this movie if you want to travel back to a time when Dutch Schwarzenegger was telling us to ""Get to the CHOPPER"" ...This is a movie with a message."
65,2," Nothing to be scare of in this movie, lots of old school male humor. Made em feel sorry for Olivia Munn. By yhe end of it I didn´t care about any character."
66,2," Honestly going in you are expecting a film that you grew up with when unfortunately you are in your seat extremely disappointed in regards of the outcome of the movie. Is this a thriller, horror or comedy. People need to come up with better plots that will make you go in Awe."
67,0, Now Predator is a comedy movie? Because is ridiculously bad.
68,1, Worse Predator movie !! Very disappointed!!
69,0, Terrible. Way to tarnish an otherwise great franchise.
70,5," Going in with low expectations as i knew i was going to see a mindless action film, I was pleasantly surprised. The action and gore exactly what the franchise had been missing over the last couple instalments. The story was pretty good, nothing out of this world but the comedy was, well (fuck me in the face with an aardvark) hilarious, i haven't laughed so hard in a film for a long time. It had my friends and i falling out of our seats with laughter at the chemistry between all the actors. The comedy was a bold but good move for the franchise and i hope they continue down that path in the future. Only issue (spoiler alert) is they could have teased an alien vs predator film in one of the last scenes but instead we were given something very cool but disappointing compared to a xenomorph."
71,3, The predator was a okay watch the movie feels like it could have been broken up into two movies. I have a slight issue with the pacing right when the movie started to provide background on the predator they sped up the movie filled it with action scenes and wrapped it up
72,3," I found the movie entertaining, although it's disappointing"
73,2," Week plot with one liners all over the place, the film doeant take it self seriously and was very disapointing"
74,1," Like the Alien franchise that it crossed over with, the Predator franchise has had a long series of disappointing sequels and misfires, including Predator 2 and both Alien vs. Predator films. The franchise's legacy continues to live on through the iconic alien that is featured throughout the films and the famous quotes that Arnie spouted in the 1987 original... ""Get to the chopper!"" Sadly, 2018's The Predator destroys the hope that 2010's Predators created in the potential for quality Predator sequels.<br/><br/>One of the film's most notable missteps comes in the form of its cast and characters. Boyd Holbrook portrays Quinn McKenna, the Army Ranger and sniper in the center of the film's plot. Holbrook does his best to make McKenna compelling and likeable, a difficult task considering how poorly written the film is as a whole. He is joined by a large collection of forgettable supporting characters, the highlight of which is Keegan-Michael Key's Coyle, a wise-cracking ex-soldier who drops some memorable jokes and one-liners. The remainder of which - a group of quirky military criminals with annoying character traits, an evil government agent who order the deaths of people without much reason, and an evolutionary biologist who manages to survive every ridiculous near-death situation because of her pretty face - are all forgettable and thinly written. This makes the plot uninteresting, unfunny (I say this because the film attempts to make a LOT of ill-timed jokes), and void of tension.<br/><br/>The issues with the characters in The Predator, however, are a result of a bigger problem that plagues the entire film: the writing. The Predator features some of the most scattershot, lazy, and brainless writing that I've seen in a film in some time. Granted, I don't make my way into subpar action films very often, so as far as I know, the writing could actually be thoughtful and well-crafted compared to other movies of the same caliber (although I doubt it). Throughout the film, characters make decisions that have no reason behind them. Things happen without any sort of explanation. Plot points are treated as important but are then completely ignored later. Major events occur without any sort of repercussion. Etc., etc., etc. The script seems to be constantly struggling to coherently lead the characters to the film's action scenes, filling the gaps in between those scenes with nonsense and half-assed references to the Predator franchise (its ""homage"" to Schwarzenegger's ""Get to the chopper!"" line is horrendous). And even when the action finally happens, it is underwhelming, bogged down by poor camerawork and hard-to-follow editing.<br/><br/>The only redeeming qualities of The Predator come in the form of the things you expect out of this sort of movie: big menacing Predators sporting cool technology, neat visual effects, an explosive action-packed finale, and, most importantly, some satisfying Predator kills and good old-fashioned gore. These things prevent The Predator from being a total flop, but they by no means outweigh the film's many flaws.<br/><br/>In summary, The Predator delivers some of the things that fans of the series want. Unfortunately, these things are overshadowed by a wealth of flaws, spearheaded by lazy writing and poor directing. I was fully expecting and hoping to walk out of the theater having disagreed with the low score posted on Rotten Tomatoes, but I was underwhelmed and disappointed. Maybe one day the film industry will give us another Predator film worth of the name created by the Arnold Schwarzenegger classic, but until then, we have The Predator, which I'm giving 1 1/2 out of 5 stars."
75,2," It was OK, I expected way more"
76,5," Great movie!! Way underrated, I don't understand why it wasn't better received. Old fans should have enjoyed it and it should create a newer younger fan base as well. Not as good as the first 2 but it's better than Predators and is a hundred times better than the AVP movies!! It's the first true sequel since Predator 2."
77,3," Even at it's very worst, The Predator is still at least a fun popcorn movie that is packed to the brim with good humor and plenty in the way of violence, even if it doesn't offer up as many thrills or as much tension as it's predecessors."
78,0," Great C.G. The visual was wonderful. Holbrook was good, Olivia Munn was not. Story was very far reaching even beyond fantasy. Spent most the time criticizing the acting and logic in my mind. Not to mention the constant vulgarity coming from their mouths. And why did they have to make that appealing to children by using filthy words for the child actor. Thumbs Down."
79,3," This was a good movie, it had humor, action, a decent plot and an above average cast. I think a lot of the negative reviews are from people who hated this before they even saw it. I would definitely watch it again"
80,0," Such a terrible film that wastes a great opportunity to reintroduce an iconic movie monster to a new generation, Shane Black clearly does not understand what made the original comecpt so appealing."
81,5," It's pretty much the bastard love child of of Predator, AVP and AVPR."
82,3," An enjoyable B monster movie with a great emphasis on violence and humor. Story has some gaps, but overall is a fun ride. Way better than Predators and the AvP franchise, this installment is worth watching."
83,2, It looks like a Marvel superhero movie. A lot of comedy and bad jokes and some unnecesary escenes which make it look like a PG film.
84,1," A really lazy film, the Plot is rubbish, the Characters are meh, the Jokes are just the worst, the Autistic Sub-plot Really ruins the film franchise.... Not worth your time.. Trust me.."
85,1," Shane Black helps to trash a franchise he himself had a part when creating it. A shameless, messy and unfunny self parody of an iconic character."
86,0, Probably the worst film I have ever watched.
87,0, You know that feeling when something is so bad that makes you feel yourself ashamed...
88,0," Biggest load of rubbish i have seen in a long time. First movie i have seriously considered actually getting up and leaving the cinema... yes it is that bad.<br/><br/>Pros; great to see if you like flashing lights and a bit of gore.<br/><br/>Cons: The action scenses were pretty pointless and falls into the big trap of predator kills loads of trained gunmen, with bullets just bouncing off it... enter one man and a 6 year old boy, and suddenly it is no match. i know you are supposed to suspend disbelief... but you can only suspend for so long before you ask yourself if this is part of the scary movie franchise... I am still unsure whether this is a really poor action movie with some comdey in it, or a really poor comedy movie with action in it. Either would discribe it. If you like the original presator, good for you, but dont go into this expecting a similar type fo movie - this is as far removed as you could get. <br/><br/>Very bad."
89,1, Worse than AVP: Requiem
90,5," It's the secuel of the other two movies, the action scenes are awesome and FOX didn't repair expenses in animation, you can see clearly the predator almost the hole movie. They just need to give a background story of the predators, their code honor, why they kill, why they choose a worth pray, etc. I would watch it again several times. My favorite til the moment"
91,5," Great Movie! Entertained as the first one, lots of references from past movies. A fresh re-start with lots of action and blood! The is a Must-See movie"
92,4," The Predator is going back to the original Predator movie, lots of action and surprises to add to the franchise. I'm disappointed that the ""F word"" was used so much which was not necessary. However, a sci-fi action movie lover will enjoy it and this is definitely a large bucket of popcorn movie,"
93,0, What a horrible film. A complete disgrace to the PREDATOR franchise. I can't believe Shane Black made this piece of crap.
94,1," Wow. That really did suck. Maybe the lesson I have learned here is to actually read some reviews before I go to the cinema... ?? Maybe the problem lies with too many pontificating killjoys wanting to sound clever by needlessly poking holes in films that do exactly what they say on their respective tins. I thought that 'Predators' was really good. 'The Predator' was not. Some dude further up/down the thread wrote a fairly in-depth breakdown of the films' intrinsic identity crises, and articulates many of the most embarrassing elements of this film pretty well. What stood out overwhelmingly to me was the gratuitously archaic treatment of gender-related sensibilities. Hearing a script like this makes me feel quite relieved for how far we have come in 30 years. Perhaps viewed in the context of a general cultural awareness which now has a more specific set of tools with which to reject institutionalised misogyny, many of the film's that we once considered to be good would, if revisited, now have us squirming in our seats. A film which is made in 2018 does not have the excuse of being 'Of its' time' and comes across as being quite specifically and deliberately offensive. Especially when it is simultaneously Phantom-Menacing all of the positive associations I previously had with the antics of the iconic Alien Badmash Antihero. Not cool. Ultimately pretty aimless and purile. Really glad my girlfriend didn't come with us. Definitely should have stayed at home and stared at the fish."
95,4, If you're a fan of the series then this is just as good as it's predecessors.
96,3, I loved that they finally explained why they take the backbones as trophies!
97,0," I went to see this movie thinking ""holy crap I love predator, I look forwards to seeing some kickass predator action doing predator things"" <br/><br/>What I got, a million jokes trying to land, being asked in a joke twice ""why do they call it predator it should be called hunter"" like the first one was so funny. A story that leaves MUCH to be desired. All of which being a predator story that feels like predator instead of what I got. I wish SOMEONE in this movie got a satisfying death and not a single one. I really hate to even bring this up because it's going to get me mislabled but speaking of plot there was thinly veiled Social Justice shenanigans in my predator movie. Don't know why we needed that but apparently we did. This movie was so bad I watched Predator 2 afterwards just to see how the movie went and actually enjoyed it. Which to be honest instead of wasting money on this movie go buy old predator movies and enjoy those at least they knew how to tell a story without getting their politics involved."
98,5," I can't understand critics that give Titanic a five star and give one star to action sci-fi movies, this one is a good movie, it has action, it's high octane like it was meant to be and there are few scenes that are cool to watch over and over again. Still, criticas and SJWs are messing the industry very hard, I remember watching Pacific Rim (the first one) and watching scores like 2 or 3 stars in RT and MC, for me movies like thises ones have that fun factor that what makes a SCI-FI movie without any ""love story"" forced into it."
99,4," If you are a fan of The Predator movies, you will not be disappointed. If you've never seen The Predator movies, why are you watching this film? There's too much you've already missed! Interesting characters. Enjoyable twists. A lot of action. More plot then usual. Go forth, Predator fans,and enjoy."
100,2," hurts to see these dark series turned to a family comedy with dumb ""humor"""
101,3," I thought it was a good movie, they brought in some real world aspects such as Autism , PTSD, global warming, etc etc... and the effects that have on people.... And I just saw all the other predator, AVP and Alien movies before watching this.....I think the director did a good job of trying to tie in all the movies, with little easter eggs here and there. It wasn't a perfect movie or did have flaws of course, but no movie is perfect. It had a good pace to it... I wasn't waiting for and dragging scenes or overly stimulated. It had just enough emotion and action as not to overwhelm you..or keep you waiting....it's a decent movie..... Can't wait to see what's next."
102,0," Shane Black must have felt pretty bitter about being the Predator franchise's first kill. He seemed to have responded in kind by eviscerating it, stripping it, and leaving it hanging from a tree for the birds to peck at.<br/><br/>This coat hanger abortion of a film wasn't even worth pirating."
103,2," Is this film a comedy or thriller? At times it felt more of a parody predator movie than actually belonging to the franchise. The ending was also highly ridiculous, I hope they don't make another one."
104,4," This movie had some wonky editing and i feel like the characters were wasted, i feel like this movie is pretty good, i love its story, and the predators. and no one cant love the one part where the fugitive breaks out of the lab. I think it could be better, but i thoroughly enjoyed this film"
105,5, undoubtedly entertaining including some solid performances.
106,3," The new ""Predator,"" the return of a classic brings a mix of nostalgia with current times, we have the action and the canasta scenes of a good 80's movie but we also have the comic relief that the recent Marvel films introduced and almost defined as a standard. The film is not perfect, far from it, but it's a lot of fun, the over participation of the ""monster"", the group of characters and situations completely kill the suspense of the long leaving it up with a humorous face with action scenes, not for less, the direction of the film is by Shane Black a director with a very strong humorous vein. With funny and funny characters, an acceptable build, a lint of script and good action scenes. The new ""Predator"" does not aim to beat the classic, but rather to bring a fun movie to market, bringing a bit of nostalgia and comic relief to please all audiences. The film technically is acceptable, the performances too, we do not have great highlights, but it is a great movie to see Sunday as a family."
107,1," The movie is a comedy movie. Not once did I feel tense or anxious. This movie is boring. The first act is irrelevant, the second act is ok and the third act is simply disappointing. The acting is not on par to the first movie and id did not like it."
108,0," Based on the previous two movies and ""Alian vs Predator"", I have had high expectation when I went to see the new ""The Predator"" movie. I had my doubts after seeing the trailer but i never thought it would be this bad. What a messed up plot, what a mess storyline. How in the world did they come up with it? They spent $200 Mil for this? I can only discribethis movie with two word, Great Disapointment."
109,3," The fight scenes were great but the story was weak. It was hard at times to grasp what the story really entailed. Again, the director choose to do a movie with few reference to previous films and lost any chance on s sequel"
110,1," Seriously the worst piece of crap movie I have seen in a very very long time. The movie is just a Predator themed Disney propaganda film. Save your money!!! During the big climactic battle scene the characters stop to talk about the Austism spectrum and how it was the next step in human evolution. I go to see a predator film for blood, guts, guns, mindless violents, monsters NOT politically correct undertones from the same company that produced such books as TAR BABY. Disney ruined star wars and everything else it has touched...this is the last nickle you will ever get from me you greedy untalented pieces of garbage."
111,0, What a pile of rubbish. A story that just jumped about with no substance and an ending that was something from a z list movie from the syfi channel.
112,5," Just about exactly what I wanted to see in a predator movie, ignore those hack critics who only care about art and not entertainment value"
113,0," La verdad, ahora a todos nos gusta criticar demaciado las peliculas por detalles que en lo personal no, nos gustan pero olvidamos la esencia principal de las películas en general que es entretener a las personas y en lo personal cumple con ese objetivo. Me reí, intrigue y moleste pero al fin del día no me pareció tan mala, no puede superar a predator 1 y 2 pero hay que dejar ese sistema de solo criticar y pedir excelencia a todo sin aprovechar las pequeñas cosas que deja el esfuerzo de las personas detrás"
114,3, Fun movie- ish. But not great by any means.
115,0," It is the WORST movie of the franchise by FAR!!! I was expecting a bad movie, but this one succeeded in negatively surprise me, which is very sad, because I love the character!"
116,4, Great addition to the franchise. Low score is another example of spoiled movie snobs.
117,0," Its an average action super heror movie, but nothing related to the other predator movies"
118,0," The worst predator movie to date. A bland plot, mediocre acting, cringeworthy jokes and bad CGI made it look like poor fan made flick."
119,1," Keep shitting out more and more of a franchise until people hate it.. and why are so many humans able to kill these Predators so easily? Its like zombie movies how people in the 70s were really useless &amp; got killed by super slow zombies &amp; now the zombies turn super quick &amp; are amazingly fast &amp; tough, yet we humans have not changed and we can kill ever more of them! Arnold Schwarzenegger must be turning in his Hollywood grave... he spent the entire movie trying to kill one... maybe he isn't so tough after all cos these guys killed 2, &amp; one was 3 times the size. Why is does evolution mean BIGGER? If that's the case why do white supremacists thing they are more evolved? Bigger &amp; fatter are two different things... This movie was rubbish compared to the original movie. At least Arnold can be happy about that... even though he took far too long to kill one weak predator, he at least can say he's a good actor &amp; been in good movies (compared to this one) - Not that I hated this movie entirely. I didn't feel like killing myself for almost the entire movie. Dog predators that become friendly when you shoot them in the head? This is getting as ridiculous as the Sharknado franchise now!"
120,3, It was very typical for what I expect from a predator movie. <br/><br/>Blood??<br/>Guns??<br/>Swearing ??<br/>Violence ??<br/>Action ??<br/><br/>The movie was at least was entertaining. The storytelling definitely needed some work though.
121,4," The Predator is taking on the difficult task of trying to steer the franchise into a new direction. Did it succeed? Meh...probably not, but I'll tell you what - if you can turn your brain off and just let the movie take you along for a ride, it's a lot of fun."
122,2," The Predator features the main character of an autistic child and then it gets worse from there. It had some good action and a few funny quips, but the overall movie was painful to watch with how many inconsistencies and garbage scenes there were. See it on DVD if you like cheesy action movies, but don't expect much else."
123,2," The most recent installment of the 'hit and miss' Predator franchise also follows suit, in that it mostly misses. However, I like to stay as positive as possible for my film reviews, so I will focus on what worked in The Predator, and you can be the judge of whether it is worthy of your time and money.<br/>Firstly, the action moves along briskly. We are swept up in the story from the opening scene and barely have time to catch our breaths. It kept my interest, even if there was nothing interesting there...so many movies cannot do this simple thing. The does move along well, keeping you busy so that you don't have time to think about the ""story"".<br/>Secondly, the addition of new types of characters, specifically the roles played by Jacob Tremblay and Olivia Munn are welcome additions to the Predator canon...both actors are solid and carry most of the acting bravado through the story. Previous Predator installments were testosterone-driven...these new characters give the writers something to chew on; and the casting choices work well here.<br/>Thirdly, the production values in the film are great, and surpass any of the other Predator films easily (in my opinion). The CGI for the most part is story-driven and not as gratuitous as you would think. So, the special effects and production design teams were on the ball.<br/>That is as much positivity I can inject into reviewing this film. I do not need to delve into what doesn't work, you can read the other reviews for that! But, upon exiting the theater, I wondered to myself - How hard is it to create a compelling story involving space aliens? Obviously for the Predator franchise, it seems an insurmountable feat. Same with the Alien franchise; it appears that something so easy to hit-out-of-the-park is lost on the tee-ball stand. But that is another thread altogether..."
124,5, Scene it with people and everyone of us liked it. I am a avid Predator fan and this movie did not disappoint. All you naysayers and RT suck puppies can lick it.. Do not listen to these idiots go see The Predator especially if you are a fan.
125,1," If it aint broke. 11"" predator too CGI, and story kept getting worse. dont like."
126,0," As my expectations were not very high, this movie still disappointed. Sure, the dismemberment is always nice to see. But a story with the depth of a peanut, an graphic glitches here and there. Some explosions were done with Paint3D. And don't get me started on the predator-dogs.. The old movies were scary, Predators was very cool, but this one takes the franchise down. I'm done."
127,1," saw it. sucked. seriously, guys..."
128,5," Me and my wife loved the movie. It is not perfect, as nothing is perfect. But we did like the story and the way predators have been shown. Of course there are holes in the story, but while watching it, we didn't really pay attention. <br/>Humor is fine, adult one and it is nice. Russian translation is not good and it is on;y a problem for me. I would like to see sequel for that movie! :)"
129,0, One of worst movies i ever seen
130,1," Prbly the WORST and most STUPID movie EVER!!! And that comes from a guy who liked Predator 1,2 &amp; 3!! What a peace of crap!"
131,0," Utter rubbish, jumps from one scene to the next without explanation actors seemed to have free reign on their characters and just make things up as they go along. I would give no stars if i could"
132,0," Terrible one liners , disconnected plot. They tried to compensate worth more violence and gore .. didn't work out at all.."
133,2," I wanted this movie to be good so bad, it turned out to be AWFUL. Pure garbage... I'm truly dissapointed. Shane Black should NOT be a director. Being part of the cast of the original 'Predator' DOES NOT MAKE YOU THE RIGHT CHOICE TO DIRECT A SEQUEL."
134,4, Watched it. Enjoyed it. It was very violent and brutal in its execution. Small amount of pacing issues and changing you're main antagonist about halfway through the movie. Also there is a attempt to explain the predator Behavior that's never been a part of the Mythos it attempts to rationalize the other movies as for some will probably come off as cheesy but if you want a head ripping good time where you don't have to compare it to Shakespeare then you may enjoy it. I did.
135,0," Hicieron de esta película una comedia tonta a una película de casería salvaje estilo depredador y que es eso de híbridos depredador humano, asco no la recomiendo para nada."
136,3," Not bat, but I hope more."
137,3," The characters at times are appealing and enjoyable, as well as some of the action and gore offered in the shape of a continuous non-stop sci-fi absurdity, but that sole absurdity ends up consuming the film's progression into an hyperactive-mindless entry in the franchise, wasting potential and offering a misplaced humorous focus, sacrificing the suspense and pure horror the alien used to provoke in the past, all thanks to Shane Black's hollow direction."
138,1," This movie is absolutely terrible. Not only the editing, pacing and story is all over the place, and it doesn't know if it wants to be a family movie, a comedy, or a sci fi action movie, it also completely disregards the anatomy, behavior and goals of the predators from previous films. It basically dumbs everything down for jokes and bad action. The last scene is just god awful joke. <br/>What a an absolute and total disappointment and shame."
139,3, Funny and entertaining. Probably the best Predator since the original.
140,3, is great predator movie
141,2, Look I came to see humans get their spines ripped out and all i got was a half assed action comedy
142,4," It was everything I wanted to see: a ragtag group of soldiers fighting aliens with a few jumpy parts and a lot of explosions. If you're interested in a decent story and a fun movie, this is a great one. I don't understand the bad reviews; if you're expecting The Butler or something you're at the wrong movie."
143,5, loved it i got my $$ worth.
144,5, Predators great movie very funny.. I can for a beloved movie franchise I'll deal with the controversy on a different platform. As far as movie goes I enjoyed it immensely!! Goo Team Predator
145,2," This isnt a terrible film but it isnt a very good one either. Just like the 2010 version ""Predators,"" the plot has depth and creativity. It doesnt insult your intelligence and it does keep you guessing in terms of why the hunter Predator is there in the first place. There is decent dialogue, comedy, and the action scenes are solid. Its just there is a disconnect on too many levels that makes it all seem too rushed, too forced, and too convenient. Plus there is no sense of doom that is cultivated instead relying on its predecessors establishment of the Predators brutality to scare you. Usually these days its the writing that sinks most films but I think this one was sabotaged more by the details and the production end. I'd rank it the third best out of the four Predator films."
146,2," They butched the lore with illogic and a, what I can only describe as, it's ""morphin time"" ending all in order to make a film I was not bored by but which, as a predator fan, I was mildly annoyed by. It's kind of a toss up."
147,0," Possibly the worst Predator movie. Whilst the visual effects are indeed sublime, the plot is a sheer mess. Seeing a Predator hunting dog turned all of sudden into a golden retriever acting puppet was just the cherry on top. Complete disaster."
148,3," It's been 31 years since the first Predator strutted its camouflaged self onto the big screen and bedeviled Arnold Schwarzenegger and company. Since then the dreadlock-sporting intergalactic sportsman has become a familiar vaginal face to movie audiences around the world. One of those company deaths in the original movie was none other than Shane Black, years before the writer/director became a bankable Hollywood commodity. Black is going back home to revive the dormant franchise with The Predator, a big-budget sequel/reboot that aims for the stars and falls far, far too short.<br/><br/>An alien spaceship belonging to a rogue Predator crashes on Earth, scattering important debris. Quinn McKenna (Boyd Holbrook) is a black ops sniper and the only surviving member of his team who happened to be on site when the ship crashed. The government says he's crazy and transfers him onto a bus filled with other mentally disturbed military vets who call themselves ""the Loonies"" (Trevante Rhodes, Keegan-Michael Key, Thomas Jane, Alfie Allen, Augusto Aguilera). A tough-talking government agent, Traeger (Sterling K. Brown), seeks out a biological specialist, Dr. Brackett (Olivia Munn), to examine their interstellar prize. At the secret lab, the Predator breaks free, Dr. Brackett chases after the specimen, and she teams up with the ""Loonies"" to track down the alien. After his initial Predator encounter, Quinn mailed the alien helmet and other evidence to his son, Rory McKenna (Jacob Tremblay), a young boy with autism who cracks the alien code and becomes the target of a Predator, a Super Predator, and the government.<br/><br/>The Predator is a supremely messy movie, often feeling like two separate screenplays inelegantly stitched together, one a big bloody action thriller, the other a winky Shane Black vehicle with a cavalier, macabre sense of humor. It doesn't quite work because the movie can't fully settle on a tone, or a direction, and thus it keeps providing glimpses of the many versions of the kind of movie it could have been instead. I'll openly admit to being a Shane Black fan when he embraces his sly instincts, command of genre, and ribald wit (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a modern comic masterpiece; The Nice Guys is... pretty good), so the Black touches were my favorite part especially because they stood out the most. I enjoyed the characters entering into scene-breaking asides, like Dr. Brackett questioning why the alien would be named a ""predator"" given its behavior is more akin to a hunter or a fisherman, and Traeger shrugging, ""Yeah, well, we took a vote and 'predator' was cooler. Right guys?"" Or when a character is being held at tranquilizer gunpoint and mocks the danger, only to be tranqued point blank in the eye, killing him. Or a bully suddenly getting drilled by the defense mechanisms of the Predator helmet and murdered. It's these moments that kept me most entertained, demonstrating Black's unique voice that can take genre filmmaking within a studio sphere and turn it on its head with a devilish grin. If The Predator had been more a Shane Black vehicle than a Shane Black studio reboot, then perhaps the final product would have risen above the mediocrity that sinks it.<br/><br/>Much of that mediocrity comes from the middling plotting, mostly after the first act. For a solid half hour, I think Black has something promising, having set up the various characters and gotten them to intersect and go on the run together as a merry band of outlaws and amateur alien hunters. Once the ""Loonies"" break free with Dr. Brackett is where the movie loses its sense of direction. The plot just stumbles from one set piece to another, rarely with good reason. One minute they're running away from a Predator creature and the next they run into an apparently unlocked high school building rather than flee in cars and RVs. Most of the plot movement follows little Rory, first reaching him before the bad men do, then rescuing him from Predator dogs, and Predator, and then he's kidnapped by the bad guys, then he's hunted by the Super Predator and I'm tired. This kid is a spectrum-walking, spectrum-talking plot device (more on that below). It feels decidedly odd to have a super sniper paired with a renegade group of mentally disturbed and dangerous military castoffs and instead of them primarily hunting and killing a space alien they are rescuing a little boy with special needs. It would be like having a Tarantino rouges gallery teaming up to teach a child how to read. It feels like a misapplication of the character dynamics onscreen, which again gets to my central criticism of the final film feeling too much like separate movies in conflict. The studio elements (supportive yet feisty ex-wife, autistic savant, Predator dogs) feel too obvious.<br/><br/>The action is serviceable with a few dandy practical gore effects. There's a nasty, visceral quality of the action that proudly wears its R-rating as a badge of honor, as a PG-13 Predator movie would be a disservice to the universe's most fearsome hunter (the first Alien vs. Predator was PG-13; I suppose acid and florescent blood are less traumatic to be seen gushing from hacked limbs?). The action gets a lot more boring once the Super Predator is introduced, an eleven-foot all-CGI monstrosity that needed a bit more work. Beforehand the Predator is a combination of makeup and practical effects, allowing longer interaction with its environment. I enjoyed the Predator breaking out of the lab. I did not enjoy the team taking on the Super Predator at night in the middle of the woods because it decided to go... sporting. Seriously, the second-to-last action set piece has the flimsiest formation. Rather than accomplish its mission, the Super Predator invites all the humans to one more game, though the alien acknowledges that ""McKenna"" is their only true champion. It devolves to jump scares in the spooky woods, but hey, at least characters can start being eliminated (some of them so abruptly that it's a blink-and-you'll-miss-it exit). There are touches throughout the action that keep things lively before ultimately succumbing yet again to the freefall of the project's creative dissonance.<br/><br/>The actors are enjoyable but I felt bad they weren't given more. Holbrook (Logan) is consistently upstaged by his eccentric band of compatriots, but only Jane, Key, and Rhodes get any personality. The other guys are just kind of there. I don't think I laughed once at Key's (Netflix's Friends from College) many, many wisecracks. The Tourette's syndrome tic given to Jane (TV's The Expanse) is rarely funny, and yet Black goes back to it again and again (the adolescent kid behind me in my theater thought every profanity was the funniest thing ever committed to film). The actors glide by on Black's signature macho, cocksure style, clinging to every new quip like a lifeline. Munn (X-Men: Apocalypse) has a few fun, feisty moments but is still basically featured as The Girl. Tremblay (Wonder) is making me rethink my evaluation of him after Room. The best actor in the movie, by far, is Brown (Black Panther) who has a malevolent charm that connects most fluidly with Black's sensibilities. Even his self-satisfied laughter made me laugh.<br/><br/>We need to talk about the film's views on autism (there will be some spoilers in this paragraph, so skip ahead if desired). Rory McKenna is of that kind of Hollywood Autism, the kind we see on TV (The Good Doctor) or of classic movies (Rain Man). It's the designation of autism as a gateway to super powers (never mind that having savant abilities only impacts ten percent at best). Whatever, it's an unrealistic depiction in an age of better, more nuanced depictions of mental health and disabilities. Where The Predator gets crazy is when Dr. Brackett offers this nugget: ""You know many people think autism is just the next step in human evolution."" No. Nobody thinks this. As someone who has worked extensively with children with autism, this is not a thing. I'm not saying by any rationale that those with autism are lesser by any means but they're no more the next stage in human evolution than any other condition. Ask a person with autism if they feel like the next stage in human evolution, like an X-Men mutant. What makes matters worse is that Black confirms this strange notion when the Super Predator, surprise surprise, was most impressed with Rory McKenna and not his big bad dad. The Super Predator plans to take the kid back to, presumably, harvest his autism DNA so the future predators will... know how to fly their spaceships that they already know how to fly? I don't know.<br/><br/>The Predator is part sequel, part reboot, part Shane Black genre riff, part muscular R-rated action movie, part chase movie, and part Hollywood mishmash. Apparently the film underwent extensive reshoots as well, retooling the entire third act, which seems obvious in hindsight and only magnifies the disconnect between the central story elements. Shane Black's signature elements are but glimmers of what could have been. It needed to be more of a genre send-up of 80s-action farce, or a more straight-up action movie, or something where the plot generally made sense and had characters we liked. Was Shane Black playing a joke on the studio? The Predator will probably be most known for editing out a real-life sexual predator, or from its dreadlocked alien dog being domesticated after getting shot in the head, or its depiction of autism, or anything that isn't really the entertainment level of a mediocre rehash. Check out Predators instead.<br/><br/>Nate's Grade: C"
149,0, spent most of the movie laughing ??
150,0," Complete garbage! I felt that I have been served fast food. <br/>Complete disgrace to the original! <br/>The unbeatable combat in the beginning, that stupid briefing scene in the bus where everyone literally introduces one another. What is that?<br/>What is that scene when one of the guys is dying on a tree and the other one laying with guys out on the ground staring at each other? <br/>The whole movie theater laughed at that moment. Pretty messed up part to laugh at but the acting is absolutely ridiculous!<br/>The face of the main character looked like he wanted to take a dump the whole movie. No emoticon between anyone, one of the soldiers is allergic to oxygen, since every single scene, even in combat is him with a cigarette. <br/>I did enjoy seeing the predator, very nicely done! The whole evolution and advancement idea is great and makes sense. Not sure why one of them came to our rescue. Brought some kind of marvel iron man suit. <br/>Dogs of predators become little poodles when you perform a lobotomy on them?! They also have those dreadlocks and can play fetch! <br/>Garbage!"
151,5, Amazing movie great time
152,0, Opinion as a fan of Predator: The shittiest crap I ever seen since the big bang.<br/>Opinion as a average audience: Just another shit on theaters
153,4, This movie was great time.
154,2, Had to give it two stars so my review would count I wasn't expecting anything other then terrible jokes and bad writing with non sensical bullshit and Shane Black delivered honestly how does he get work?
155,1," Demasiado misoginia la película, hubo un punto que parecía mas una película de comedia que de ciencia ficción"
156,1," Esto parece una burla, un irrespeto a la franquicia. Nunca fue muy buena pero esto se sale de todo sentido, el guión es pésimo, los personajes son de pacotilla, la música es un fracaso y hasta los efectos son malos. Que cosa tan puerca y triste, nominada de una para los Golden Raspberry."
157,1," An absolute mess of a film, As a massive<br/> Fan of the original and even the sequel I walked out broken hearted"
158,4," the predator is exactly what it's supposed to be. I's the best film in the franchise since the first one, it was nostalgic without being over the top, you find yourself truly caring about the characters, and best of all it's just fun."
159,0," The movie had almost no predator action, the entire movie worked like a parody while showing mental conditions. Focusing on them rather then showing any slow brutal predator action. The only hunt happens at the end of the movie and everything moves so fast, that you have no idea who is now dead and who is still alive. Don't waste your money if you want a classic predator movie, but if you like big buck b-list action you may like this."
160,1," Oh boy is this film bad. <br/>The first predator film had the simple but interesting concept of a bad-ass hunter proving it is the best in the galaxy, and its dominance over every other species, by hunting everything else, with a smart hunter hunting smart and capable soldiers..<br/>This film has taken that concept into an species that goes round taking bits of other species that it has killed to modify itself, (even though all the species are weaker), and inserts something about invasion, end of the world blah blah.<br/>how is it possible to mess it up? even AVP got it better than this.<br/><br/>If I was to sum up the film it would be weaponized autism ."
161,3," The beginning sucked, but over all it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen. it gave me a few laughs, but there are lots of things that could have been better. If your ever bored laying in bed and it's on Netflix or something I would recommend it."
162,1," Sucked! Plot of the movie: Because... Manmade Global Warming! It was confusing, full of moments that had us asking questions like, ""What did he say?"", ""What happened to the dog??"", ""Why didn't the bullets work 10 seconds ago?"" ""Did that guy (main antagonist) just disappear?"" Additionally, there was a LOT of military detail badly wrong, and according this loser of a film, autism is the next big evolutionary development in humans, and everyone seems to be psychic (for example, there's a loud noise and someone says, ""He's turning it into a translator!""), and the bad predator inexplicably reveals his whole plan and mission to the humans trying to kill him. Did I mention this movie SUCKS!?"
163,1, This movie is terrible. Literally walked out about 3/4s of the way through with no interest in the ending. Tries to be comedic and fails. Tries to be an action movie and is bland in that respect. Tries to score points through troop worship but screws up accuracy regarding military stuff. (Is the main character a captain or lieutenant? Is he an 11B or some kind of 18X super sniper?). Fails to add interesting lore to the Alien/predator storyline. Although they tried to give the vibe of original predator movies it comes off campy/hacky in a bad way. Do not waste your money.
164,3," Whilst not without faults, The Predator is an enjoyable and fun movie which doesn't feel overly compelled to make sure it isn't accidentally offending anyone."
165,2," Very disappointing movie, due to some simple ""schoolboy errors""<br/><br/>Sound quality is low, coupled with very rushed delivery (everyone mumbles fast)<br/>Stream of swearing by everyone even the children, feels like the director is<br/>trying to avoid a 12A (UK) rating so just get everyone to start every sentence<br/>with f***. CGI effects are not integrated well, so effects just go on on<br/>unrelated to movement of the actors (it's obvious they can't see the CGI<br/>players)<br/><br/>Seems to have collected every cliche going, got to have:<br/>1: Strong female , in jeopardy<br/>2: ex wife<br/>3: child, but of course a computer wizz<br/>4: Dog? (Dog in a predator movie, really)<br/>5: group od disposable bad (but really good) guys ... actually this correct for a predator movie<br/><br/>Looks like it's trying to be another ""Iron Man"" movie ... super hero vs alien"
166,5, Good attempt at trying to capture the first movies charm
167,5," Great film, likable characters and a convincing (and sequel baiting) plot. Strong and charasmatic acting from all, even the little guys. A rare find in the action film genre.<br/><br/>Its genuinely funny, fast paced, and above all believable. And departs from the run down ""lone hunter"" story the first 2 films ran dry.<br/><br/>And thank god for Thomas Jane and Keegan Michael Key, they gave this film serious live.<br/><br/>I would see again, and will get it when its released on DVD."
168,1, Another franchise ruined by money cash grab on a popular 1980s IP. This movie was more of a spoof with no idea how was to make the predator cool so we will just have Olivia munn be the action st as r because woman are just as capable of whatever oh and global warming will kill us all in 30 years and autism is evolutionary and people suffering with PTSD isn't serious and it makes people so fun and interesting. This film should of been a reboot of the first movie and just keep it simple and fun with a serious suspenseful tone...
169,0," Too many inconsistencies The boy (Jacob Tremblay) seemed to have some kind of learning problems and turned out to be a genius child. Agent Traeger (Sterling K. Brown) looked like a clairvoyant guessing everything and solving the movie for the audience. The veteran Baxley (Thomas Jane) was a totally idiot character, it was a shame to see a good actor in such a bad role (He also looked like gay couple of veteran Coyle). The alien dog had the attitude of a terricola dog. The giant predator did not seem to have the attitude of an imposing alien predator but rather seemed to have the attitude of a New York gangster, what was the purpose of the spit in the base ball field ?. A BAD MOVIE. TOO RIDICULOUS. FOX PLS STOP THAT KIND OF MOVIES!"
170,2, Shane Black has given us the Last Jedi of the Predator franchise. Throw yourself in the bin with Rian. What a wasted opportunity.
171,4," Okay, I am a big Sci Fi,fan,. Saw this movie, and am absolutely confounded by the critical reviews. Were they expecting an oscar-contending drama extolling Shakespearean neo.romantic tragedies of Predatorian nobility? Was the misfit band of brothers on it's way to military prison supposed to confront these explosively powerful extraterrestrials with erudite elucidations? Was Olivia Munn expected to wade through this testosterone soaked movie without resorting to harsh language? This is a badass Predator movie through and through. The creature kicks ass in every scene it's in. The ragtag soldiers are hilarious and all get slaughtered in some quite inventive ways. The plot manages to compress a coherent sequence of sci-fi action featuring murderous aliens, a whole bunch of explosions and a whole bunch of gunfire and a nice body count into 2 R-rated hours. Expect spacecraft battles, savage monsters, plucky heroine, exotic weaponry, f-bombs, some funny lines, and that dude from the Expanse. Bring popcorn and band-aids for the plot, and sit back and enjoy the kickass mindless mind-blowing fun."
172,0, A complete disaster.
173,1, Worst Predator movie yet.
174,0, The worst movie I've seen in a while. The director basically took a very famous franchise and turned it in to trash.
175,4, In no way is this a good movie... but it damn well is a fun one
176,0," Pésima, Chistes innecesarios por todos lados, cómo paso un Film de acción a comedia?"
177,0," FUC**** YOU Shane Black THANKS SO MUCH FOR IRON MAN AND THE HANGOVER IN ONE !!! <br/> YOU HAVE MONEY BUT THATS ALL , YOU KNOW WHAT FANS PREDATOR WHANT TO SEE SO WHY YOU CAN GIVE THATS REAL DARK PREDATOR FROM JUNGLE WITH REAL MAN !!!! BUT WE HAVE KID WITH PREDATOR MASK FUC..... SAD :("
178,5," Great movie. <br/><br/>but Rotten Tomatotoes CRITICS and AUDIENCE SCORES are RIGGED.<br/><br/>It has been caught on REDDIT.<br/><br/>It seem like fake people are logging into just bash THE PREDATOR which was a really good movie. than THE NUN, which is the had triple the amount SOLD TICKETS than PREDATOR. <br/><br/>*RT Audience Scores are FAKE<br/>*RT Audience Comments are FAKE<br/><br/>"""" THE NUN"" 2018 """" was more POPULAR """""" THE PREDATOR 2018"""""" <br/><br/>So....<br/><br/>If """" THE NUN 2018"""" had TRIPLE amount of an AUDIENCE (SOLD TICKETS) / ,..<br/><br/>than THE PREDATOR 2018...<br/><br/>THEN HOW CAN THE MOVIE "" THE NUN 2018 "" HAVE LESS AMOUNT OF ...<br/><br/> Rotten Tomatoes AUDIENCE SCORES ...<br/><br/>... and LESS Rotten Tomatoes AUDIENCE COMMENTS than....<br/><br/>than THE PREDATOR 2018. <br/><br/>If more people watched THE NUN 2018"" then how the hell is ""PREDATOR 2018"" getting MORE COMMENTS AND SCORES????<br/><br/>Same with all the DISNEY MARVEL movies.... LOOK AT THE AUDIENCE SCORES numbers... ridiculously high..<br/><br/><br/>Isn't this Illegal advertising? <br/><br/> Can someone from the government look into this please??"
179,3," Some funny dialogue and some great gore, but with an incoherent mess of a story."
180,1, Decepcionante. Vergonzoso... No hay otra forma de calificar esta cosa...
181,0, I am surprised to see that over 40% liked this piece of crap. I went in with low expectations and found the movie to be far worse than what I had expected. It makes you appreciate just how good the 1987 Predator is. There is nothing about this installment that is worthy of praise. The plot is filled with holes. The painful attempts at humor. The characters meant nothing to me from beginning to end. The special effects were better in the 1987 classic. I noticed that Shane Black directed Iron Man 3. The Predator did at times seem like a terrible Marvel movie. I could go on and on. This movie stunk. Save your money. I have seen better movies on the Sci Fi Channel
182,3," can't help myself when it comes to Yautja movies. wasn't great but I want another suspenseful action horror, wish they would try recapture the feeling and aesthetic from the first couple Predator movies."
183,0," Although portions were humorous, the rampant Liberal subtext makes this unwatchable. Making fun of disabled vets is unconscionable. Sad."
184,0," Awful, just awful, how this scored better than Predators 2, I'd never know. Awful casting, terrible plot, horrendous ending!"
185,1," No, don?t, put you?re wallet back in you?re arse pocket and go elsewhere. <br/>It?s not worthy of my time trying to review it.<br/>Yes it?s that poor."
186,2," 270. The Predator. A pretty sweet Predator flick. Bloody, action filled and ends with a promise of countless sequels for the future... So things start off with a space battle between two predators, one crash lands on Earth, gets himself caught, loses his stuff, which just happens to be scooped up by a sniper there on a totally unrelated matter, but, shit happens. Now as you may have guessed, this predator escapes the lab, kills a whole bunch of scientists, gets a little human hunting in, a joke make throughout the movie is that the predators are actually hunters, and of course needs his crap back, which of course the sniper guy sends to, well blah blah blah, it ends up in his autistic sons hands and unlocks its powers, which of course can be tracked by the predator, and its around then when as you may have guessed, the other predator enters the scene, cause he can also track and you find out... well you saw the trailer, which literally gives the entire movie away. To me it felt like the Expendables met The Avengers to fight The Predators. The sniper guy gets thrown in with a bus filled with military men with mental issues, it was pretty amusing, Tom Jane and Keegan-Michael Key formed a pretty entertaining crazy person duo, Theon Greyjoy is there for some reason, oh yea to die, the most amusing is the two leads the characters Quinn, the sniper, and Nebraska, a dude that tried to kill himself, chain smokes and convinces all the crazies on the bus go round for round with an alien. Also, Nebraska chain smokes, and the constant reminders of smoking is bad is hilarious, when he's off screen, you can hear him coughing, at various times he runs out of breath and throws the cancer stick away, once you notice it, you can't un-notice it. I dunno, it was a fun movie, yes its pretty formulaic, and the main theme dealing with the Quinn's son has been done before, and before that, and ok it had a very lame attempt at using the quote ""Get to the choppers"" thrown in. I did really like the villian the flick, Traeger, the government dude sent to get the all the wonderful thing an alien species on Earth has to offer, he was a good bad guy, know what I mean? Yup so thats my convoluted mess of a review and I'm sticking with it. Can't wait for the next one, I'm such a nerd. Filmbufftim on FB."
187,1," It was not good. When the sheer number of F-bombs become the primary source of entertainment, that says it all"
188,3, Fun funny and better than the avp movies
189,5," Thought it was cool, funny, and a pretty fresh take on a franchise that was, let's be real, headed off a cliff.<br/>I'm also a sucker for predators speaking, so that was pretty neat. <br/>Might have said ""finally, I'd do it too"" when they talked about how human DNA in a predator might mean some woman slept with one."
190,3," Le doy un 8, el final no me gusto, es desconcertante, pero esta buena, terror, gore, violencia, monstruos, aliens, utopia, cientificos locos, supervivencia"
191,4, What is missed by those with negative reviews is the charm of the outcasts sprung from a prison bus for military grunts that gives new meaning to 'motley crew' that nevertheless seek to save the world. Think you've seen this before - see it again!
192,5," Soy autista y con Asperger, está película me ha impactado mucho, probablemente ahora empiece un partido político para acabar con la raza subdesarrollada que son los no autistas gracias por tanto Predator"
193,0, Yeah give this one a pass
194,2, I got a few good genuine laughs out of this movie but it was very choppy to the point of being ridiculous. As if it didn't have a final screening. It was entertaining but a huge joke to the franchise. Don't waste your money seeing this watch it when it quickly comes to television.
195,2, Lame. A MISSED opportunity.
196,0," SHANE BLACK doesnt understand the defintion oF the predator , its about the hunting and suvirval. the predator wants to find an opponent worth dying and keeping the hunting code. not this non sense IRONMAN/PREDATOR SUPERHERO MOVIE. thank you for killing the franchise MR BLACK"
197,0," Me gusto..! Pero perdió el misterio, y a lo ultimo ese traje como si fuera IRON MAN apesta.!"
198,0," this movie destroys the predator franchise in every way possible. i expected it to be bad , but this is over the top of awfulness. this movie ruined my week . nothing makes common sense , nothing matters in the movie . just stay away and watch it on dvd in you are curious of how bad it is."
199,0," what a giant turd. cannot believe this pile of crap was green lit and fully produced, and then released. awful crap."
200,2," The movie had some really great action scenes, and definitely showed us more of the Predator than we have seen before, which kept me watching, HOWEVER the horrible acting by the CPT Guy and the predator dog cliff hanger lessened the rating for.<br/><br/>The main characters' acting completely sucked. He was too overt, and too corny. I was not a fan, his acting was totally distracting. And the Predator Doggo, yea sure its butt fugly, but I want to know what happened with him?<br/><br/>All in all I would definitely recommend it because the action scenes were great, it was nice, bloody and violent, but not too grotesque and gory, and the fight scenes were amazing. <br/><br/>Great movie ruined by a cornball actor and minor plot holes"
201,2, A cientific turn into a super soldier in just a minutes...
202,0, Worst movie I've ever watched.
203,0," i see the movie and its really a shame , shame on shane black shame on fox to make this ... its amazing stupid , really guys im a fan of predator 87 and 2 and avp 1 (ok) all last is shit , so this the redator from 2018 is realy high level of power rangers telefilm with bad so bad actor... poor fox really"
204,5," It had its funny parts, it had it action, and it had decent characters. Maybe expository was a bit cheesy but other than that it wasn't bad. I'm not sure why there is so much hate for it but I had fun. There was a lot more terminator/independence-day like fighting with the predators walking down people than the old stealth mode techniques. So maybe it was people expecting the same old type of predator action."
205,4," This wasn't the same tired Predator movie. It was witty and original. Amazing in its ability to make psycho misfits likeable. The first Predator was unique, and none of the sequels came close to matching it. This one didn't have to because it's a different approach, not a rehash of a concept which has seen its day."
206,3, My wife and I actually liked it. There were a few things really wrongwith the movie but we still liked it. It also has some really funny jokes.
207,5, Loved it as it was just a fun romp not trying to be too serious
208,0," The first time in my life have I ever walked out of the cinema, absolute dog crap, turning a classic into this joke, Hollywood strikes again"
209,3," The Predator is at its best when Shane Black combines big, dumb 80's action and his classic witty one-liners."
210,2," This movie was medium, I expected more, only violence and some interpretations are saved the rest disappoints."
211,5, This move is fantastic. We laughed all the way. The truth is that this is a great comedy that is faithful to the Predator franchise. I think people need to remember the AvP movies and the last attempt at a Predator prior to this one and appreciate how good this movie actually is. I love Predator one and two and I am glad we got this diamond in the rough instead of another edgy desserts.
212,0," Worse Movie I have seen in years. I love Sci-fi, and the Predator series, but this movie is so bad it might be the worst movie of the year. zero stars if that was possible."
213,5, It was a really good movie
214,3, Better than expected. New twist on the franchise.
215,4," This movie is great. It's got Shane Black's classic sense of action and humor that brings back memories of the 90's greatness that he helped create. Critics are dumb. The only thing this movie is missing is a guy like Arnold, and you can't find those anymore."
216,0," A terrible addition to the Predator movies, of which I have only enjoyed the first installment. Until this horrible movie I maintained that Numero Twa was the worst of the bunch, now I nominate this steaming pile of film waste as the number one horrible predator movie. <br/><br/>The movie slaps on a 18+ gore rating and then provides hilariously bad cringe-worthy gore that just makes you roll your eyes, pointless, overdone, silly. We have pointless special effects stealing the budget, like an alien spaceship dogfight and the characters being chopped in half by the alien ship's shields. The plot, the writing so so terrible it makes you want to go on your phone.<br/><br/>The characters are all horrible. Badly written, badly acted. The Predator (female apparently, because she's SMALL) and the Uber Predator are both not scary and continuously do stupid things like spare a female character because... she's female? How sexist IS THAT??<br/><br/>I groaned and squirmed waiting for this garbage to end."
217,5, The comedic timing was perfect. Every character was likable. I honestly don't understand the low rating on this.
218,1, I thought it was going to be a more serious film but it had too much comedy for my taste.
219,2," It's very clear that this film was massively interfered with to the serious detriment of it's effectiveness and basic coherence. The first half hour is basically fine. It has a few odd jumps in plot, but the characters are basically set up (although Olivia Munn's entrance is abrupt to say the least) and the first real action sequence is okay. From there, things get more than a little sketchy. Action sequences have really abrupt jumps where characters seem to teleport from one location to another. Plot elements are introduced and dropped with no resolution. Something as basic as the main villain's primary goal is never really explained, and he's killed off so abruptly you could actually miss it. I think it's clear that this film was supposed to be around 2 1/2 hours long and with all the cuts and re-shoots, it's down to an hour and 45 minutes and it really makes little sense. It's a shame because I can detect the core of a good idea here, but it's just not realized."
220,1," Felt like each aspect of the film was overcompensating for the failure of the others. Direction, visual design, writing, acting, sound effects, musical score, and plot were all painful to endure. I miss the 80's, when even bad movies were good."
221,4, its a fun movie that I hade fun with B+
222,5, Petite Noir-face off- schizophrenics. Epic!
223,1, So bland it makes vanilla ice cream look virtually saucy.
224,0, What a megga disappointment..... I demand my money back BLACK.<br/>This should be the Predator movie to save the franchise unfortunately it fails on everything from the get go. We dont need a BIGGER PREDATOR !!!
225,3, I did nothate this film was entertaining. But should come with a warning: This is the not the predator film you came to see but a Marvels alternative. Expect to see ironman in future instalments.
226,1," Not at all good, No original content."
227,1," Destroys the lore for instance they don't take skulls anymore as a trophy, they only ever wanted the spine for your DNA. Because predators are genetic engineers now"
228,3," The Predator. I believed this movie could be a good Predator installment. The film's reliance on CGI is pathetic. The jokes were good, I laughed along. Jakob Trembley's performance was very good. But there is not a storyline, its just explosions, loud noises and jokes. Predator lands here, soldiers try capturing it, most of the people die and that is it. The ending was stupid but sort of smart as well, The Predator left that device there because he is basically saying that they are coming back and they want an worthy opponent. The movie just felt flat, nothing really special about it and the story is just not there. Because of all that I give The Predator 3/5 stars"
229,1," The original Predator is one of the best thriller movie ever made, one reason being how simple and straight to the point it is. A team of hardened Soldiers sent into the jungle are forced to face an alien hunter...that's the movie, no sub-plot, no big revelations, just Arnold and his men vs an outer world killer. <br/>So how Shane Black came up with this insane script and screenplay is an experience I would give my left eye to see for myself. <br/>This movie is a colossal misfire"
230,4," 'The Predator' is not going to become the revered classic that its 1987 predecessor is, but I found it to be a (mostly) worthy successor. The cast is enjoyable, the action is fast-paced and fun, and it sets up the opportunity for the franchise to get back on track."
231,3," Saw the film this evening and for what it was I thought it was fine not great not Academy Award Material but fine. It is entertaining had several missed possibilities in it. One they brought in the Bull Dog and it looked as if that was going to be the boys protector however missed the chance. Then the Alien Dogs came as a possibility but they too fell short on use. Some items could have been incorporated better but were not and some that were used should have been not used however since evidently the film was too long in editing phase they cut a lot of elements out and left some in. A lot of that might from second guessing in the editing, and test audiences. Now do I think it is a bad move no it is just a movie that provides a chance to step away from reality and spend some time disconnected from reality."
232,0, My IQ actually dropped from watching this film.
233,0, Worst movie of the year.<br/>Had more fun watching Slender Man.
234,4, I liked it. Lot of things going on.
235,1," Shane Black takes a group of fun quirky characters and drops them into a mess of a movie with a script straight from the SyFy channel. A few of the characters discuss how the creatures in the film shouldn't be named Predator, well that goes for the film too."
236,4, Don't know why people complain so much about this movie... it's fun and expands the franchise!
237,2," Fun action, lazy ass writing"
238,1, i am beginning to loose all hope for the future of films because if this is what $100 million buys these days we may as well just stop and put the film industry out of its misery
239,4, This one was just as fun and entertaining as the first 2. Can't wait to see the next Predator in the saga.
240,0, This movie is lame an lack of any sense. I want to stand up and get out of the cinema before it's end but insted I stay and laught...a lot. Also be prepared to see a predator power ranger.
241,1, Writing is horrible.
242,3," Story was a mess. Action was good. It wasn't horrible, just felt kind of dumb. Humor was good at times."
243,2," In the same way that Alien: Covenant ruined everything I liked about what Prometheus set up, this ruins everything established in all preceding Predator films. But it had some fun moments."
244,4," good funny, neat characters, great action and visuals, decent story. overall a lot of fun, worth the big screen. i guess predator sticklers didn't like this new take on the creatures and story."
245,4," Solid action flick. Well written, funny, and the acting is above average."
246,1," Critics Consensus is goddamn right. ""Chaotically hollow action,"" at best. Very little of the action was believable w/in its own fictional world, or even all that good/intense at all. All the character decisions &amp; setups were implausible. The story beats were disjointed, schizophrenic and poorly-related. Both Predators in the movie were a let-down who did nothing very Preda-cool and were totally underutilized. Beyond that it was over-farcical. A very wasted opportunity. Oh... and Preda-IronMan. Christ. This is ""Predator"" as a goofy action-comedy. ""SPLAT"" is right."
247,0, Its so stupid and incompetently put together that it becomes nothing more than an insult to Predator fans and movie lovers in general.
248,1, A syfi late night movie quality movie with a bigger budget...a waste...hurts the ip
249,1," This movie makes no sense at all, the plot is all over the place with no cohesion, and it betrays all of the movies that came before it. The Predators are no longer hunting us for sport (so forget the trophy room &amp; warring the skulls as apparel); now they hunt us to get our DNA, because absorbing the DNA of much weaker life forms make you stronger, WTF? Also retardation is the next evaluation for humans, unfortunately this may be true, there is a lot of evidence of this on any college campus today. I almost forgot the silly rant about globe worming , then the villain lay out the Predators plans for no reason, just before he order the killing of the heroine, don't worry she is saved by the space dog (a recurring theme though the movie)and the villain blows his own head off for no reason. This movie is DUMB!"
250,5," What a ride! It baffles me to see the abundance of reviews calling this film ""poor"" and ""messy"". It was a refreshing new take on the franchise I've stuck with, and loved for many years and I couldn't be any happier. I actually feel sympathy for those who couldn't appreciate a film that both pays homage to the first two films while expanding this universe and exploring ideas that have hardly lived to see the light of day. The action, the characters, the music, the effects. All on point. Actors involved delivered great and memorable performances, particularly Boyd Holbrook, Olivia Munn, Thomas Jane and Trevante Rhodes. People complain when a franchise film plays it safe but now people are complaining and to be quite frank, nitpicking over an otherwise bold and brilliant movie. Yes, there are some minor issues that were noticeable however it didn't detract from the experience I had. I really admire the way they throw you into it from the start as if to say ""you asked for a Predator movie, here you go"". Anyone who was influenced by the 34% Rotten Tomatoes score and decided not to ""waste"" their money. Please, just go out and see it and stop letting others dictate your actions. <br/>P.S <br/>The arrival scene at the beginning is fucking fantastic and just about sums up why I love the predator."
251,0," WORST MOVIE IN LIFE! It's so bad, I created a RT account just so I could warn people. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY!! I ALMOST spent the money on an IMAX ticket. If I would've done that, I would have been TICKED!! Terrible plot (nonexistent), terrible acting, filming, editing, writing, producing...Terrible EVERYTHING! WHO ARE THE 49% THAT LIKED IT?! They had to have been drunk or high. There's no way they were sober!"
252,5, I think people expected this movie to be more like itrs predeceser predators but i think the way to enjoy this movie is to just expect a fun action movie like say what suicide squad tried to be all in all great film if you dont expect a more serious movie
253,1," Awkward injections of humor that seem to try and draw from Marvel films (much like Star Wars's latest entries). Poor handling of the canon of the film. Confusing moments....moments where suspension of disbelief is just stretched too thin.<br/><br/>I had to stop watching it. Its got some good action points and fun call backs...but good god, its just bad."
254,0, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.
255,1," Terrible film worst film in years a insult to fans worldwide, incoherent script , non existence characterization, intensive on the disabled , crap CGI I"
256,3, If you want a night's entertainment give it a go. The Halloween bully getting his comeuppance is a good laugh and its got a really big predator in perfect after the office fun...
257,0," This movie is someone's weird fancition of a predator movie. It does its damndest to try and fuck the predator universe into a state of unsalvageable garbage. Well, they did it. The kid having a disorder some how means he has fucking super powers. And super alien tool hacking skills. He is the worst part of this movie. And the rest of the cast is no jewel either. Don't see this movie, don't give shane Black your money."
258,0, I wish there was a 0 star option too...<br/>Upgraded predators with downgraded fear from them..<br/>They we're running nd shown like joker's.<br/>Poor special effects nd graphics.<br/>Poor ost
259,4," Keegan Michael Key and Thomas Jane do wonderfully in the Comedic Relief, Action sequences can sometimes be lacking but still its still predator at its roots"
260,4, I liked it. It paid homage to past Predator flicks and added to canon without changing anything in the past - something not all franchises manage. I feel the producers respected the fan base - something ELSE other franchise producers could learn from. I was entertained from start to finish.
261,1," The movie starts off great with plenty of action and had that predator movie feel to it but then when it gets to the middle of the film they completely dropped the ball and i felt i was watching a show in nickelodeon like spy kids or something, even the music started to suck. I felt like the movie try to please adults then did a 360 and try to cater kids which ultimately ruin this movie, another really bad idea was going with a CGI Super predator that is like 10 feet tall it just look fake and stupid, When ""PREDATORS"" by Robert Rodriguez was made he introduces Predator dogs which they didn't look bad at all these new ones look fkn stupid with dreads i fkn hate them. felt insulted by the stupidity and laziness of its design on top of that in roberts film they were vicious beasts in this one they become playful and stupid WTF. and how does a Hunter Killer dog turn on its owner helping humans that try to kill it? made no sense. There is another part in the film where they are on the ship and its clearly gone a distance leave the female doctor behind and some how she magicly teleported to come back and help save the day.. another thing that does not make sense if the Predator Fugitive came to earth to help humans why the fk is he killing them? For me, once the Predator in the suit dies by the CGI one this movie dies with it. The line towards the end of the movie was retarded when he asks ""What the hell are you"" then says STFU as he then shoots the pred in the head did not fit in the movie. And... OMG wtf is up with the ironman suit at the end of the movie.. This film could of been a lot better and the 1st half of the movie proofs it but then they just buchted it and easily made it the worst film in the franchise. Even the other films that weren't so great still took the franchise and there movie seriously ,this one seemed like a parody"
262,0, Last Jedi levels of poor film making. I can only presume the the plot is so poor due to last minute re-shoots. Avoid at all costs. Go home and re-watch the original instead.
263,5, I really enjoyed The Predator I enjoyed what Shane Black did with The predator following it on from the first 2 predators about how they came to earth. I also really enjoyed the comedy in the film it was class. I will say that I thought it was a really short film I thought it could of been at least 2 hours long.
264,1," A Passable action movie. Human villains are a bit too irrationally 'kill everyone'. Movie attempts to glorify autism as the next step in human evolution. The super predator actually refers to a young autistic child as a ""true warrior""."
265,1," Comedy was terribly unfunny and that's terrible since it seems that was the thing they wanted to focus on the most. The Action was between bland and a muddled mess, the gore an afterthought, the cast ranging from bland to annoying, the writing coming off as lazy at most time. The way they portrayed autism was just a poorly thought out idea and that can sum up this movie just a series of poorly thought out ideas edited together in some of the sloppiest ways ."
266,1," Trash.. too many bad jokes, more decapitations than the middle ages, messy story line, Characters were all over the place. Genuinely nearly walked out of the cinema"
267,0," This is a disgusting attempt at a Predator movie. Don't know what's worse, the bad action, half done special effects or the ""Comedy"". The characters are all boring stereotypes with some stupid exposition to their special character traits that are only there when the movie feels it'll be helpful or funny. It's hard to take it seriously, so it's a comedy? It's not funny. The jokes aren't in any way funny or character building. At one point the kid points out that someone is using reverse psychology.. The only thing that's important about the kid is his autism! One of the key elements to his specific disability is the lack of understanding of sarcasm, reverse psychology and some other ways of communication. <br/>The main character is not likable or developed. He's supposed to be badass and that's shown by him threatening his friends in case they badly effect his son. The scene makes him look like an ass and in no way does it make him scary, it makes him look like an angry, cringy kid. The exposition to his character is his wife explaining that's he's awesome and great.<br/><br/>Let's talk about what everyone goes to see a Predator movie for, the Predator and action. Both aspects are weak at best. The action is not only boring and predictable but also badly done. There is 0 suspense throughout the whole movie. The action is not you wondering what might happen next, who will survive, how could this possibly end? You watch the movie with the knowledge what will happen as the action starts. So people can argue that it's just a stupid action movie but when the action can be exchanged with a narrator saying ""And then our characters won by killing (person/predator) the end."" Can we still consider it action? There is a single fun action scene as the predator escapes the lab, that's it, about 3 minutes of the movie that I enjoyed. <br/>I was so excited! The Predator? 18+ ? A competent writer? This has to be good. The gore was something that I thought would add to the Predator but it was just there for the sake of it. It didn't add or take away from the movie.<br/>How did they make the predator look worse than it looked 31 years ago? The CG was awful! In some scenes it looked like it was taken out of a movie like sharknado. I understand the need for it on the Mega Predator but why the original? It's supposed to make him look move alive but it looked like a statue made of play-doh and his eyes looked 2d. <br/><br/>The plot of the movie was badly written and presented in exposition and characters guessing things that you can't possibly guess but the movie always shows that they are right. All the characters have plot armour. This is easy to see since in the scene when aircrafts attack the predator ship it auto fires and destroys them but when main characters are shooting at it as some of them stand on top, the ship doesn't even care. This is of course one out of many scenes.<br/><br/>The only reason I give this movie even half a star is the fact I like that one scene and the camera work is usually alright."
268,3, Was enjoyable as an action move as long as you don't put too much heart into it. There are so many places where it takes a huge dump on the whole franchise but if you go into it with no expectation you might get pleasantly surprised by a simple B movie with a bit of sci fi and some jokes thrown in for good measure.
269,2," Another pop culture franchise ruined by treacherous story telling. The movie (like alien covenant and Prometheus from a certain POV) completely disregards the 30 years of previously established lore in the franchise. To not spoil the movie I will say that this movie made the predators feel like generic evil invaders and makes their species look weak in order to ""upgrade"" themselves to establish the whole plot of this film. The only thing this film had going for was the action and gore. The film had very good special effects and some jokes that made the audience chuckle. But it defeats the suspense of aliens ripping peoples spines out to just throw in a joke every so often."
270,5," I've been able to quote the original film from memory since I was 9 years old.. It was actually the movie playing in the background when I lost my V"" card...Needless to say, the Predator franchise is kind of a big deal to me. <br/>On that note, I will point out that I did indeed enjoy and appreciate The Predator. Scratch that, I LOVED The Predator. It was fun, fresh, gloriously gory and it flowed really well for the amount of content. Not to mention the chemistry of the characters along the way added a new and previously unheard of element called ""comedy"" to the Predator franchise. Which was a welcomed change of pace after 30 YEARS!!<br/>If you want to see an inventive and dare I say SEXY new take on the franchise, then give The Predator a watch. If you want to see the same movie you've already seen 6 times, this is not the movie for you..."
271,4," Went into this movie pretty much know the gist of what I was going to get. The Predator is never going to be Hannibal Lechter. So, people looking for insightful drama or some charismatic villian, you can only fault yourselves for going to this movie.<br/><br/>I liked it a lot more than I thought I'd like it. Never thought I'd watch a Predator movie and laugh out loud as much as I did. I thought the autistic angle was nice, but could have been fleshed out a bit more to give the audience more understanding of the autistic brain and, therefore, why the big Predator wanted the boy as the trophy. The fight scenes were good. The humans didn't stand a chance, as usual. But it would've been sweet to see another human with a combination Hanzo's katana skills and Harrigan's doggedness.<br/><br/>Have to say the ending was cheesy - the whole ""Iron Man suit"" from bracelet??? Really? <br/><br/>Overall, though, it was cool I got more than I paid for."
272,0, Save your money if you don't want your love for predator series ruined.
273,3," Its underlying message was a little preachy, the dialogue was reminiscent of Dora the Explorer, and the first (second?) corpse looked like an unaltered Halloween decoration they found on the clearance rack, but it's fun and they clearly put a lot of money into pyrotechnics."
274,1," SUCK! Boring, no story very dull and pointless..."
275,1," Garbage film, don't waste your money."
276,0, Wanted it to be good. It was horrible. It seems like they edited out key sequences that would have made plot holes make sense. Absolutely awful.
277,4, Way better than I expected!
278,4, Very enjoyable and sets up what could be a very entertaining sequel and franchise to come. Like the original in the 80s this may well be a sleeper hit that will gain more fans in time.
279,4," I liked it. Different take on the other movies. Action, Drama, and a little comedic relief."
280,5," Tho main character is bland and the comedy levels are a bit high(and corny), the franchise might have a future if a real A-list takes over and the action is simplified a bit.<br/> ( NOT the Rock or Jason Statham; they filled up enough flops lately to not be taken serious)"
281,4," I don't know why this movie is not rated higher... It is not a re-do of the excellent original film, but it is a very good movie, with enough action and plenty of fun!"
282,4, As a stand alone film this is a good movie not great just good and if you like going to the movies then you shouldn't hate this film. Now If you compare it to the previous predators then it becomes a bad film.
283,0, Sorry... worst of them all.
284,0," This movie is so painfully bad. It covers all the basic tropes, and uses mental illness as a comedic factor. The whole story gave me a headache, and it's trying way way too hard."
285,2, I would absolutely take the original over this one.
286,4, I don't know where all this hate is coming from. The movie was a good addition to the franchise.
287,5," Soooo good!!! Audience clapped and cheered in my theater.<br/><br/>Seems like critics really want people to ONLY SEE DISNEY KIDDIE movies. <br/><br/>- Solo a Star Wars story 2018 --- 71%<br/>- Star Wars Last Jedi 2017 ------ 91%<br/>- Ant-Man and the Wasp 2018 ----- 89%<br/>- Avengers Infinity War 2018 ---- 89 %<br/><br/>Critics don't want people to watch other good movies like:<br/><br/>- House with a Clock in Its Walls -- 55%<br/>- The Predator 2018 --------------- 34% score<br/>- Jurassic World Fallen Kingdm --- 48% score<br/>- Equalizer 2 2018 -------------- 50% score<br/>- Predator 2, 1990 --------------- 25%<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Predator 2018 is action packed suspenseful all the way with a couple of hilarious moments.<br/><br/>The Predator = A-"
288,1," One star, cause I can't give less. Worst Predator movie, ever."
289,3, Good movie; lots of laughs and action. That's all you are after from this kind of movie.
290,4," Okay, all of these critics need to get off their high horse and realize what this movie is. It's not made for an academy award. The Predator is an action flick that is made for a general movie goer to and forget about their career and is taken to an alternate reality. The movie is a great set up for a continuing franchise that I believe is about to lead into an epic battle between factions of Humankind and the Predator Hunters. Yes, the movie is cheesy in some parts, but why does every movie about aliens have to be 100% serious or 100% comedy. Can't we have the best of both worlds? I don't want to give away the ending to all but I believe this story is only going to get more intense and real. They finally give the predator something we haven't seen before (A voice). They make the predator not more relatable but an intelligent being capable to commicate with our humans, If used correctly in future movies it will only make viewers want to choose sides and participate in this world that the studio is trying to create. I for one am excited for what is to come from this franchise and hope that i can get a ""Team Predator"" shirt in the future. I hope to see a movie with the Predator Home base, better actors seeing the vision and jumping on board and a more polished continuing story that the studio is trying to create. Go see this movie and help the studio create this universe. If they have close to my vision I believe the movie will be epic!"
291,3," It was fun, predictable and it felt like the movie was running out of time so the writers were like ""LETS KILL EVERYONE QUICK!"" I lost track of where characters were and whether or not they were alive until the very end. But what did people expect from this movie? You get what you thought you would get. I wish there was a whole movie based on just the guys on the bus... I don't need them to fight an evil alien, I'd like a movie of them just hanging out."
292,3," A victim of controversy. It's not as bad as the critics will have you believe. But don't watch it with any expectations from the original. Two very different approaches to the franchise, but good nonetheless."
293,0, Vergüenza deberia darles haber hecho<br/> semejante bodrio con una saga como esta.
294,5, This was not as bad as criticized. Pretty decent and watchable movie.
295,3," the predator is an alien on a murderous rampage for 1 hour 40 minutes. if you like that idea watch the film l, if you don't then don't watch the film"
296,1," Okay the movies not perfect by any means. But I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, was the intent of stupid, yes! But I love the god like between the whole crew the cast. Thomas Jane was awesome as always but really killed it. The jokes landed mostly for me and the action was awesome oh, I'm so glad it was our r-rating. The gore in the blood was perfect, this is a fun film to watch. Again the ending kind of stupid but I still enjoy this movie 90%. I will go watch it in Dolby again and I really want to check it out in the AMC Prime. Go see it."
297,3, Overall a very fun action movie just that the story is a little confusing but a good predator movie in my book.
298,5," it's a turn your brain off film. If you go there expecting the next big Oscar-winning movie you're going to be disappointed, but if you go there with the same expectations as when you saw The Expendables then you'll have a great time."
299,0, Seens like a new Indiana Jones movie! Worst movie ever...
300,3," Not as bad as I thought it was going to be. Great special effects, music score reminds me of original, overall acting could gave been better, it did have humour, at times a bit too goofy overall worth a watch if you like the original ??"
301,5," Sister saw it at the Chinese Theater in Hollywood, she said it was a good fun movie. So with that I will be going to see this movie come this Friday evening."
302,1," Shane Black hang your head in shame, i had to fight with myself not to walk out half way through the movie, terrible acting, cringey forced sexual humour, movie too dark the whole way through, god awful CGI, I am a massive fan of the 1st and know every word, Predator 2 was underrated, Predators was a B movie but a decent watch although they copied Predator 1 a bit too much, but this? I feel ill thinking about it, hopefully it makes enough money to justify a 'Non Shane black involved Sequel' for people who are saying they like it...what is wrong with you? Watch the first one again please, enough said!"
303,1," A seriously misjudged film and the latest to suffer from Hollywood's current 'Marvel syndrome'. The studios need to understand that most franchises are not Marvel, and if you make them in the Marvel format you break them. The Last Jedi is another tragic and appalling example. Please stop stuffing films with inappropriate and constant humour - unless you're actually making a Marvel film. The Predator franchise is not a comedy, so why are literally half the characters comedy ""loonies""? Who made the call to turn Predator into a comedy? It's incredible that with such easy source material a studio could produce such garbage, it's not funny, the action is poor, the characters have zero substance, the plot is silly, the giant predator is completely out of place, and don't even get me started on ""Predator dogs"". <br/><br/>Just like Last Jedi, this film should be wiped from humanity's memory. It misunderstands its source franchise, it injects poor and inappropriate humour, it fails for the first time to make the Predator scary and menacing - it spends most of the film just walking round, uncloaked, in full view, and they even manage to finish with a pointless bit of Hollywood virtue signalling, that autistic people are the next stage in human evolution. On every count this film fails, and fails hard. I would not recommend going to see this even if the tickets are free."
304,1, Really bad in most every way but a few good action sequences at least.
305,0," This movie was a complete garbage fire, from start to finish. I could not believe how awful this movie was. As a fun of (most of) the original films, I knew not to expect too much. But, this was ridiculous, even for the film series standards. The acting and writing was atrocious, and the plot straight up didn't make sense. It was a sloppy mess from start to finish, and it makes you want to just revisit the original instead of wasting your time with this one."
306,1," The trailers didn't sell it. The cast didn't sell it. And now I'm starting to believe Shane Black really isn't all that he's cracked up to be. This movie was painfully bad. The plot made absolutely no sense and the character motivations were so uneven, I questioned if this screenplay even got a second draft. I didn't care about any of the humans and found some of their dialogue to be offensive. Tourettes isn't comic relief. Ever. Maybe it's time for this franchise to die."
307,4," I watched it again last night and I actually enjoyed it quite a bit more. I caught some jokes that I missed the first time (probably due to me over analyzing it the first time and not just enjoying the witty banter). The eyes on the Fugitive didn't bother me as much this time. In fact I'm pretty impressed with the suit and face. I'd agree with everyone that he needed more screen time. This is the goriest Predator film to date, but with a fun adventure movie style tone versus a horror slasher tone that people were probably expecting. Just go in knowing that and enjoy it for what it is. I have a feeling it will be appreciated more in the years to come."
308,3, The Predator aka. STFU .... its not what i expected but still not bad movie. Ending scene was total sh it
309,3," Sure, it's a bit of a mess, but it's a thoroughly entertaining mess."
310,0," Like a mouse on chloroform, the predator has little conscience, no direction and is full of cheese. Prepare to leave the movie early and have some wet wipes to wash your eyes."
311,1," this movie should not have been a PREDATOR movie: so far away from 1 and 2, it would belong more to AVP: the movie sucks, is confusing, doesn't make much sense"
312,2, Awful. It's like they wrote the script as they were filming the movie. Just coming up with random stuff that didn't tie together or make sense.
313,4, I have always enjoyed watching The Predators series. I love how funny the characters are in this new film.
314,5, Very entertaining! We had four people in our party and we cheered it on till the very end! Highly recommend!
315,3," Not great, but better than most of the predator movies."
316,4," In the beginning it was a little erratic without the appearance of solid direction; although, after it found its rhythm it finished strong."
317,1," A real let-down, but that should not be a surprise. after 4 NEAR-moribund PRECURSORS. The newspeak=labelled 'franchise,' begun by SCHWARZENEGGER &amp; company back in 1097 is one of those incrediblY RARE hollywood feats, a blockbuster that can never again be anything like matched by a sequel, much less a plural of the same! fEW WRITERS, SCREEN- OR OTHERWISE, HAVE THE IMAGINATION AND SKILLS TO ACTUALLY BUILD UPON SUCH CONCEPTS--YEAH, PLURAL ON THAT ONE TOO--AS THOSE PUT FORTH IN THE ORIGINAL. IN THAT RESPECT IT'S MUCH LIKE fRANKENSTEIN, dRACULA (WHICH OF COURSE GOT A BIG HAND UP BY ACTUAL HISTORY), THE wOLFMAN, &amp;C. oTHER MOVIES WITH SIMILARLY UNIQUE ideas are independence Day (the original, only), avatar, and the thing.<br/><br/>Part of the problem here is that even fewer writers--or purveyors of any art form, understand what the word 'unique' actually means, which results in such moronic complex terms as 'very unique!' Something either is or is not unique, not 'very,' or 'sort of,' or any other modifier.<br/><br/>The foregoing should suffice as an introduction to my actual review, which can be summed up in my own complex term: cheap collection of disconnected and incoherent events and interactions between the least likely, piebald or skewbald characters conceivable! Whew. that was certainly a mouthful, but there's really no one-, two-, or even three-word term that could possibly express this latest miseffort by Mr. Black &amp; company!"
318,0," ""From the same director of iron man 3... "" nuff said"
319,2," Mas que cagalhão, hein.."
320,2," A complete fail. Big fan of the Predator franchise, so this one was a huge disappointment. Predictable, horrible acting, story line was mediocre."
321,2, Ruined the predator legacy!!
322,4," Highly entertaining, good story, great acting, just plain fun!"
323,5," I loved the movie, this was the first time since the original Predator I could not figure out how they were going to bring the new Predator down. Lots of laughs lots of good kills, what else could you ask for?"
324,0," I love the franchise, but this was awful. The ""big one"" smokes the Predator like he's a granny. Lame characters. The scientist chic turns into Tomb Raider instantly? Poor cinematography. It pretty much stunk in every aspect. No suspense. Lame CGI. And is it just me, or is the ""Predator Killer"" Marvel's War Machine? Nothing original"
325,3, this new addition to the beastly franchise excels in the visuals aspect and somewhat refreshing atmosphere but could do better with giving loyal fans an impactful storyline.
326,0," I have always liked the predator movies but I was extremely disappointed with this one. The only awesome part was the giant predator <br/><br/>The language was so bad! The multiple references to oral sex use the P word was super embarrassing not to mention the hints at masturbation concerning the nude ""works of art"". The string of nasty jokes was really annoying as well.<br/><br/>I went with my older sons to see this and wound up really hating this for all of the nastiness."
327,4," Not great, but thought it was a great ride for this franchise, For those expecting a terrifying plot, not this time around. Enjoyed the off the wall dialogue, made a nice change. Al in all, our party had a good ride."
328,2," I wanted to like this film I was even willing to forgive Olivia Munn's bad performance. It started off great the jokes made me laugh though it felt like they were trying to capture Marvel Studio movies humor just more R rated but as the film went on the plot points just stopped making sense, it became so stupid that it was clear the plot wasn't thought through very well &amp; the Cheesiness towards the end of the film, my God I wouldn't put that cheese on my pizza, it felt so forced and over the top makes you want to gag. Also in that end scene Quinn McKenna didn't even look like a proper military personnel in uniform , his hair was so messy and ungroomed like they just pulled him off the street.."
329,5, i actually enjoyed the movie.....
330,5, A awesome movie. Lot of nostalgi and a new created stuff.<br/>I love it... ??
331,4," Really good movie for any normal watchers, a decent movie for predator fans that know the lore but that ending was awful. Everything else was amazing, the ocmedy, the action, everything!"
332,3," The Predator is a success and failure for the long running franchise. The best part of the film is the humour, something that hasn't been explored since the very first film. SHane Black brings some of the fun back into the franchise after two sequels detoured the more serious storylines of the cinematic universe. The rag tag crew is more Dirty Dozen than marines from the very first film, the lack of another Arnold has been a long standing question for the fans. The Predator is loaded with action and gore, the creature is still one of the most interesting studio franchises around, much like Alien. The issue I have with the film is the central storyline, it just ticks along with only the humans guessing the plotline. When I first heard Shane Black was the filmmaker bringing us back to the universe, I had a very positive reaction, the guy has created some of the most interesting buddy cop films no watches. he succeeds at shaking the franchise but he fails on a coherent film that will be loved by fans of the original. The final scene reminded me of Independence Day 2, with the revelation being a new weapon against the bad guys, this was a let down for me, maybe something like a cliff-hanger was going to be more interesting. The film is fun and time will tell how it grows. I will say it answers a few of the long standing questions about The Predators, like how they can track us using their technology and the interstellar travel they utilise, this fixes some of my issues with Predator 2. 18/09/2018."
333,1," In the tradition of 2018 remakes, this is in the class of Ghostbusters, the return of the cunts. People are allowed to continue a franchise, whilst having no clue, why the original worked and do everything to shit on the fans."
334,5, I don't trust the critics! I still do not get all of the negative reviews?? The movie accomplishes what it was meant to. It was very funny and entertaining! I'm a HUGE fan of the Predator movie franchise and I love Shane Black's approach to this one. It's different but different isn't necessarily a bad thing! If you go in with the notion of not taking the film too seriously and as a moment to kind of just turn your brain off and see someone else's vision of this franchise I think you will find some entertainment within it. Go see it for yourself!!
335,1," Filme Horrível, shane black desconstruiu conceito do predador que conheciamos."
336,5," This movie is an action packed, blood splattering, adventure. I don't know what kind of academy nominated film othe res are looking for in this, but it kicked all kinds of ass. I'm going to go see it again."
337,0," before the predator was more sombre mysterious interesting than now. Good horror in the past turned into a senseless action movie. The creators simply earn the franchise's popularity just like Films saw, green elephant, it's a stranger, a nightmare on Elm Street, Friday 13, screaming and so on. My rating is 4.4 of 10"
338,4, I dont c wat the problem ppl have with this movie. Its exactly wat it's suppose to b. Its funny it has action and it's very entertaining. It's stupid FUN.
339,0, Crap shit movie dont pay for this shit.
340,0," Una completa porquería. Esta película insulta toda la saga, no es coherente ni con la saga ni los cómics ni lo que la propia película intenta ofrecer. Un sin sentido de comedia estupida y que no viene a lugar. No se la recomiendo ni a mi peor enemigo"
341,1," more like the Parodyter. if it didnt consider itself a Predator movie... three stars. straight up joke of a movie. Shane Black and Fred Dekker, i am disappoint."
342,3," OK to go pay to GO SEE MOVIE, but NOT NEARLY as GOOD as the original MANY YEARS AGO, the FIRST about this movie."
343,3," It's not the best iteration of what it could have been, but The Predator is entertaining enough because of its action, script, and cast that you won't be disappointed you saw it. Unfortunately, it has plenty of problems plaguing it, so just make sure and gloss over those when you start to think about them. It's a great action/adventure/horror very much in the vein of The Mummy and Van Helsing."
344,1, Even the trailer looks dull.
345,1," Just a comedic sci-fi movie with a bunch of gore, one liners, and bad acting. Probably the worst Predator movie to date - AvP was even better."
346,4, Best Predator movie since Predator 2
347,3," It's not the best iteration of what it could have been, but The Predator is entertaining enough because of its action, script, and cast that you won't be disappointed you saw it. Unfortunately, it has plenty of problems plaguing it, so just make sure and gloss over those when you start to think about them. It's a great action/adventure/horror very much in the vein of The Mummy and Van Helsing."
348,0," not bad, at least, I know more about the technology of the predator. <br/>and in the end of the movie, we will know why Shane Black has directed Iron Man. very cool."
349,0," The worst Predator movie of the franchise!!! Save your money. Ive seen better movies, actors and dialogue on the Syfy channel (and those movies generally suck). This movie is full of corny, awful lines, supposed comedy, liberal stereotypes of the military, and just a plain old fashioned crappy plot. I believe I even saw a predator spit spit at a cop car. Did Black lives matter direct this film? Give me a break. Then there is the ""super"" predator on steroids lumbering around in plain sight. Oh brother. Utter garbage and an insult to the franchise. Ive never been stressed before because a movie was so bad but this pile of excrement almost caused me to walk out."
350,0, From the previews it looks terribly acted and filled with too many jokes.
351,0," 100% worst movie of the year. How do you mess this up so bad!? The story is 75% already there! Very disappointing where they took the Predator franchise.. all those poor movie goers had to sit through this for an hour and forty min. John McTiernan the original director, Jim Thomas, John Thomas original writers of the predator im sorry your creation came to this mess. Sci-Fi is dead and this movie killed it. the acting wasn't so bad... so i can't blame the actors.. they were working with a terrible script a rushed story... the whole movie was rushed. The people involved in making this film have no standards, they mashed some well funded crap togeather and made a bad movie, with a popular name to get a ROI,"
352,3, I was quite disappointed by this movie. The ultimate predator gets killed so easy HAHA what a joke! Was this supposed to be a comedy ?
353,1, oh boy. what a crap. they could have had arnold with the right script. boy. why do they do this?
354,3," Loved that it kept the original music, hilarious quips and wit, enjoyed all the characters. Predators are very cool, it's like a comedy, action, sci-fi all in one. Leave your brain at the door and enjoy."
355,3," Entertaining, but still a pretty terrible movie."
356,1," Waited 6 months to see this. Shocker, like as bad as the first ninja turtles movie. <br/>B grade acting, c grade cgi effects, just awful."
357,5, I don't know why this movie is getting such bad reviews I thought it was really awesome!
358,5, To be honest this movie is underrated as a person who has seen all the predator movies it has to be the best one and besides no movie has made me laugh as much as this movie since thor's ragnarok .
359,3, It's was very corny in parts But enjoyable. I enjoyed it better then then last jedi shite.
360,4, Its a OK movie. Fun to watch.
361,5, I really enjoyed the movie. Good cast and good mix of humor and action.
362,1," Interesting and good effects. The story lacked depth, not near enough explanation on why the yautjas (predator race) were fighting each other, without proper back story it left too many holes that were annoying. It did somewhat explain were the ""super-Predators"" in ""Predators"" movie came from but that was about it. The very end scene was super cheezzzzz and I hated it. The only reason to see this on the big screen is the special and visual effects."
363,3," 3.5 Not terrible, but also not without its faults - mostly in editing and continuity. A few chuckles spread throughout and a glorious ""get to the chopper"" line that is criminally undervalued. Naturally, it plants a seed for a sequel which may or not come to fruition based on how poorly this movie is being received."
364,1," Ridiculous dialogue, unengaging characters and bizzaringly volatile story telling make for a laughabe waste of time."
365,1," TAKE THE BAD WRITING FROM A TEENAGE SLASHER, WRITERS WHO SAY JUST BECAUSE FOR REASONS WHY PLOTS OCCUR. BAD ONE LINERS AND NO ONE CAPABLE OF CARRYING ON A REAL CONVERSATION... WITH REALLY GOOD GORE... AND OP CHARACTERS THAT CANT DIE BECAUSE... WELL BECAUSE... AND YOU GET THE NEW MOVIE PREDATOR!<br/><br/>I AM COMPLETELY OFFENDED BY THIS MOVIE<br/>#predator #sucks"
366,1," Terrible. As a stand alone film, with no expectations of following its predecessors it may just scrape a 2 star. As an addition to a much loved franchise it falls way short, on a par with AVP Requiem. Uneccesary story, uneccesary ""humour"" , terrible editing, uneccesary ""giant"" predator laced together with some very average CGI (sometimes bordering on laughable) and the least said about the end the better. It's not just nostalgia either, watch the other Predator films first (yes, even Predators ((which I actually liked)) or AVP) then watch this and decide. How could it have gone SO wrong?"
367,2," Disjointed and messy, however some of the dialogue and action pieces (with the real Predator and NOT the cartoon one) were good so... a missed opportunity but not a total disaster."
368,1, The movie a bit like Jell-O: it appears solid until you go looking around for a bit of substance.
369,3, Preditor is that kind of movie you go see it once and forget about it
370,0," Watch the emo jazz club scene from Spider-Man 3 over and over for 2 hours, while listening to culture club. That is 100 times better than this steaming pile of $h1t. So bad! So disappointing! Just stop. Don't make anymore predator movies!!"
371,1, The actors are not believable. Plot holes galore. Wasn't drawn into the movie that didn't evoke any emotions. The ending was predictable.
372,3, Doesn't come close to the original. Would wait for it to come out on Netflix or something before spending any money at the theater.
373,5," So dope! If you are a fan of the franchise go see this movie. Don't allow these wack a$$ reviewers sway your decision to see a hilariously entertaining installment. Shane Black did a great job paying homage to the original and created a realistic world. It was a roller coaster ride of fanfuckingtastic fun! I WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE AGAIN! Thank you Shane, hope you get to do it again!"
374,4," It's not the best predator movie, but I enjoyed seeing my favorite alien back in action."
375,0, Not too bad a fun movie
376,5," Best Predator movie yet! Great story line, exceptional special effects and new, creative action scenes and story elements. Humorous at times, suspenseful and lots of action.<br/><br/>Can't wait for the next one!!"
377,2, Went in super hyped. Left...no so much...
378,3," A well-done movie, but it fails to bring out the fantastic, memorable original movie."
379,1," The movie was a big disappointment. Bad script, bad CGI and the kid plot. Cringy jokes. Don't see it."
380,3," The vibe from the final trailer is what we get. We have the bloody violence that?s expected, but the amount of comedy is the thing that will make you either like or hate this. Out of all 6 films with Predator, this was the lightest in tone. It worked for me.?I had my doubts on the supporting characters, or The Loonies as they are called. They had very good chemistry and I enjoyed their banter and interactions more than I thought I would. ?This film also knows how to pay homages well without coming off as blatant rip-offs. There are a couple variations that I thought were clever.?This is the most enjoyable Predator movie I?ve watched since the original."
381,5," Awesome! Not perfect, but awesome."
382,5," This was a fun movie! Action packed! The Predator is a savage! It's not perfect but it was far from being terrible! Whoever is giving these reviews that it's horrible and terrible are lying to you it's worth the watch in theaters . When the movie was over the whole theater applauded, so I'm not alone."
383,0," The acting is awful, I'm not sure why they keep casting Olivia Munn."
384,4," I was looking forward to seeing this new take and was very entertained, and that's all I ask for in a movie. Olivia Munn kicked butt and was impressed with her performance. I was not familiar with some of the other actors, but all in all, they brought their best to the movie. I am not sure how they are going to bring another sequel with the premise at the end of the movie (without giving it away). Although there may not be another coming. My one issue is the one line that was used way too much ""Shut the F*** Up!"" and I don't have issues with swearing when appropriate, but it was used ad nauseam. It gets boring and that's not good."
385,0, It's not good bad just a terrible film!
386,0," Wasted Opportunity!<br/>It's hard to criticize this movie without giving away too much of the plot. I was on board with the idea that they seek out the best species in the galaxy, harvest their spine(DNA), and continuously upgrade themselves. However I couldn't get behind the cast, the goal of the predator, the ridiculousness of the Super Predator and dogs, and the ending. Huge fan, wish they would stop overthinking it and return to a cat and mouse game...without creating a super-cat. Also, are A-list celebrities not interested in Predator?"
387,3, There comes a time when Shane Black needs to dial down the Shane Black and he overshoots the mark here by some margin.
388,1, Awfully sad to see such a great masterpiece be destroyed into this comedy shit show. Terrible terrible terrible!
389,0," Save your money, I am glad I used my rewards for a free movie ticket otherwise I would have been pissed. I don't think the director had a clue on this one! Olivia Munn, terrible actress! Started good , then I started to worry 25% of the way in and just got worse from there. Honestly I tolerate most action movies if they are bad, but for me who is pretty generous on my movie taste , this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I wish I had the past 2hr of my life back, to beat my skull against a wall, LOL! Atrocious!"
390,0," One of the absolutely worst movies i've ever seen, not even on its own is it any good!<br/>The poor acting is only overshadowed of how extreamly bad the story was, it is degrading against all previous Predator movies, including AVP!<br/><br/>Gives it 0.5 since i cant give it 0!"
391,0," Holy crap. This was a trainwreck of trash. Comedy got some cheap laughs, and the idea of a plot going from point A to point B are where any semblemse of positive notes are. A shame of a film no doubtely fornicating itself because of the studio, navigating a minefield hitting mines on purpose out of failed references, call-backs, and poorly executed sub-plots. I wouldn't even see this again for free, with free drink and free popcorn."
392,5, THIS IS REALLY GONNA BE INTERESTING ESPECIALLY THE PLOT IN HOW THE TRAILER BEGINS
393,5, Funny and fun film lots of action not trying to be anything diffrent loved it .
394,4, This is a good Sc-fi/action move with the Preditors as bad ass as before lots of action and not bad plot.They have set it up for a sequel Predator fans should watch.
395,0, Good action but the plot was so unbelievable!
396,4," We all had fun...cool cool opening, cool ships, cool new predators armor and awesome kills. I loved the characters but cringed at the some of the vulgar ""humor""...it crossed the line to pathetic thug level. I didnt care much for the new but unoriginal predator, less so for the pathetic dogs, and the CGI and ending was bad...sad really... Kinda like they ran out of money. STILL, fun, lots of action, fast paced..really really fast... and gory...all good things."
397,5," this movie is the bomb!!!! and looks to set up some good movies headed forward. I loved shane black's take on the predator series and hope you love seeing these movies for what they our and not what ever fan fiction you had in your head . it check every box for me as fan of the series these movies hold up better then any other sic fi movies that came out at the time ( aliens , Robocop and the terminator ) . unlike its counter parts every new entry has not add something or try to retcon what happened in the last movie. even the weaker AVP movies has there place in this new movie. I love this movie and thought it to be the strongest to come out since the since the original. if you don't love action , good character development, and some badass fight scenes this movies is not for you. go watch a chick flick or some other lame kids movie."
398,5, Great movie. Very funny which i did not expect. Great storyline and good action. Go watch it. Don't listen to other reviews. I think they watched the wrong movie or something lol
399,3," Aliens, Gore, Profanity, Im sold."
400,0, Really unnecessary inappropriate language and sexual humor. The storyline was so stretched and poorly written. We walked out less than halfway through and requested our money back.
401,1," The violent action was there, but it wound up getting mindless pretty quickly. Add to that an underdeveloped storyline and mediocre acting and this movie smelled strongly like a Golden Raspberry by the time it was over."
402,3, Actually pretty fun.
403,0, Wait... what was the genre of this movie... was it intended to be a comedy? I compare this movie to Jason X (2001)... I'll now put this movie to the back of my mind and pretend it never happened... SHAME!
404,0," The director, actor and actress they all just ruined the whole series.<br/>I prefer Predator 1 and 3 most. They were just awesome. 2 is also good. But this one was holy crap! I prefer ""Adrien Brody"", he suited best after Arnold i will say.<br/>The actor and actress all of them were so amateur in their acting."
405,2," If it wasn't so poorly written the plot could have been salvaged. Most of the attempts at being humorous were a lot like trying to force a fart that you should have just kept in. <br/>Groups of the same writers ""agents of averageness"" rehashing the same ideas with the same political overtones. Tony Stark called. He wants his prototype back. And thank god she was able to run through 5-10 miles of densely packed jungle in under 4 minutes to arrive precisely when she was needed to save____. And the cheezy pickup lines are only funny if its the 1980's and coming from a jacked Austrian. You're all terrible at writing. Just stop. Only modern day hollywood could make a murderous monster from space not scary. Two stars instead of 0 for the graphics."
406,3," Unapologetically violent, funny and wildly odd throughout its run time. Shane Black's The Predator has some faults within its tone and pacing, sure, but the film is not trying to reinvent the franchise. Instead, Black takes full advantage of the film's 'R' rating and never looks back."
407,2," Absolute garbage. Barely 2 stars. I've been all about Predator since the early 90's, I'm 36 years old. I know action movies. Shane Black and whoever wrote this pile of hot garbage should be ashamed and reprimanded for this. Hold off on this until it gets to Netflix.. or TBS. This thing is trash. Watch ANY YouTube review and it'll explain in depth how far this movie fails at attempting to carry the Predator torch."
408,3, Fun and entertaining. Almost like watching Lethal Weapon with alien.
409,3, Movie was very entertaining... good cast of people (except maybe the female role) and a new twist on the typical Predator movies. The cast were likable and funny but serious enough to make the movie work. I thought overall the movie was action-packed and suspenseful and worth the money.
410,1," The only reason I am giving this movie a half star after the first is that the action scenes with the Predator were mildly entertaining. And I enjoyed Olivia Munn and Jacob Tremblay. Other than that I thought this movie terrible. It is by far my least favorite in the franchise. This movie completely re-worked what the Predators are all about. It lost focus on the hunt and made it more about other things (including the odd choice of having them accelerate global warming to destroy the planet?) anyhow, I felt that this movie was just a bunch of hollywood action scenes thrown together with an ensemble that everyone would like and the Predator tag slapped on. Not a fan of this entry."
411,4," Great cast, lots of laughs, action and gore I absolutely loved it. Would definitely recommend it."
412,0," Pure garbage...<br/>Go back to the last film (predators, a good movie) and rethink this."
413,3," The predator shines for its averageness, not amazing at all, not so different from other films of the franchise, just average."
414,5," I am satisfied with this film. action, cast, music, all was on good level."
415,3," Bearing little to no expectation for this movie, The Predator actually entertained me to be honest."
416,0, Good Movie. Very comedic
417,2, SHOUld have waited for it to come on netflix. it has funny moments but the ending completely ruined the movie.
418,0," Why is there a comedian as a cast member...in an action, thrilller film?"
419,0, simplemente esta franquicia nunca defrauda
420,0," If I wanted a movie packed with zingers and one-liners,? I would have opted for a comedy. Additionally, lots of bad acting - really bad."
421,4," Although the Horror feel didn't stretch past the first act, and the plot was kind of everywhere, I can safely say that this movie was a lot of fun and worth watching. I laughed a lot and enjoyed the action a great deal. The cast did a great job and is easily my favorite Predator cast (with the exception of Arnold). Shane Black really does stamp his name on this movie with the same comedic tone he always uses. <br/><br/>Now, I won't sit. And act like the third act wasn't a mess, but this was kind of expected with the reshoots in mind. However, I hope that they don't stop here and come with a sequel or reboot for the franchise further down the road. Hopefully with someone who can merge thriller and action together better than shane. <br/><br/>All in all, It felt like a shane Black movie, but it didn't feel like Predator."
422,5," This movie was alot of fun. Shane black knows how to make an exciting, quippy, good old fationed action movie. And thats what this is.. if you were a fan of the franchise, this will give you another solid installment to enjoy."
423,2," Not as bad as the AVP films, but certainly the weakest in the Predator franchise. Some nice touches but felt too much like an all-out action, no story chase film."
424,3," It is not that bad, I actually enjoyed it way more than I have expected. I am not saying that is perfect, because it is not and there are some story flaws especially in the last 20/25 minutes. But it's fun it's action packed and the cast works really well together (the motel scene is great!) <br/>Also I think we need to remember that is a movie about an alien that comes from space to kill another alien that comes from space...what I mean is, it's fiction, don't ask too many questions. See you at the movies, live long and prosper folks."
425,2, An action-packed blood-fest with a heavy handed sprinkle of comedy. A lot of sci-fi and not enough of the original predator vibes.
426,1," Everything about this movie is terrible and if it were possible to delete every copy ever made, that's what should happen. This movie was choppy, had endless plot holes, and the comedic satire was out of place and awkward. The thing I hated most about this movie is how I'll never be able to get the time back that I wasted watching it."
427,2," This was an insult to the Predator franchise. The first couple are incredible to this day. There are things to enjoy about the the Alien vs. Predator films, but this was just bad! The comedy in the film is so out place and the characters are so underused this really feels like a cheap cash in. Avoid!"
428,2," Some mildly fun laugh. The look of The predator is very real and cool. however, the convoluted plot and characters makes the movie mostly boring. The kid character is over-the-top and I don't really care about the father-son relationship. This is the same for the relationship between the crazy soldiers. REally wish they did not show Key's character's joke in the trailer because it was pretty funny."
429,0," I signed up just to rant about how bad this movie is. I mean it is BAD. The plot makes no sense at all? Friendly predators that kill you? A government agency that rounds people up but decides to kill them? If you took out all the swearing the spoken lines would be done to 5 minutes (I have no problem with swearing). Oh and the ending. Someone was a fan of Iron Man/War Machine. <br/>The director and screen writers should never, EVER be allowed to work in film again. This movie makes the show an genre an absolute joke.<br/>I want my money back!"
430,0," In 30 years I don't think I saw a worst movie. The director and writers should stand in the corners of a street begging for their useless existence, not making movies."
431,5, THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST ONE I'VE EVER SEEN!!! Do NOT believe in bad reviews! REAL VERY AWESOME! !!!!
432,0, This is so bad. its not even a good popcorn flick. So many things are unexplained or just make absolutely no sense.
433,0," Yep. Just a bunch of college kid's humor with some CGI tossed in. <br/><br/>Chef's Talking Points - <br/>1st -What movie wasn't referenced...<br/><br/>2nd -So not science fiction but more science funny ...like The Orville, the original Predator, and the Goonies all decided to have a baby together.<br/><br/>3rd -All that was missing was some Marvel Iron Man moments...no wait that was in there too.<br/><br/>4th - How many cliche lines from the old movie could be massacred?<br/><br/>5th -How many times can someone say Mother Fu%$#r?<br/>Even children had to say it.<br/><br/>DONE ?<br/><br/>I should've waited until it came out on VHS - no actually until it came out in Braille...or sandscript or smoke signal ..."
434,2," This is too great a franchise to be turned into a battle of witty one liners. The Predator should have been a tense, rigid and thrilling horror movie like the original and other sequels. Also, the plot was way too lax and lacking. Focus more on story telling and horror next time and ditch the comedic/quit wit angle."
435,2, The installment that takes the franchise in a comedic course that doesn't work well with the established lore.
436,1, It was like Predator meets Home Alone but not scary and not funny. Don't waste your money. Shame. Why can't they just bring back the 90s? FIrst 2 were scary and cool. This was a waste. You can really feel how plastic the mask was.
437,2," cliched, violation of the lore of the first three movies, fake nude scene, and special exceptions to logic."
438,5, great movie! Expanded the ethos
439,2," It felt like Fantastic Four or Justice League in terms of the editing and reshoots. Clearly there was a good to great movie there at somepoint, but the studio reshot random scenes then remixed other scenes to create a collage of scenes with no connective tissue. Plot points and characters dropping in and out at random, and so many hand waves to explain away cut scenes or character moments...there better be a director's cut in our future. What makes this so sad is--before the reshoots come into play--this movie is unbelievably fun. It's the return of Shane Black and Fred Deckker I have been waiting years for...then suddenly the wheels come off the bus and it just keeps going into the land of nonsense and ""things happening."" How do studios think they can get away with this bullshit? This movie angered me."
440,5, instant b movie cult classic!
441,0," I can not say enough bad things about this movie. It's basically a remake of Mercury Rising with the occasional predator thrown in to accommodate the movie title. Too much time spent on development of characters nobody really cares what happens to, and not enough expected predator awesomeness . 2 very disappointed thumbs down ."
442,5," Enjoyed the movie, especially from being a full generation viewer."
443,4," I felt Predator was a very entertaining blockbuster film. <br/><br/>This film has a more humorous bent than the previous one. I really did like Predators, but I prefer the tone of this film. It matches more of the over-the-top tone of the original and 2. They do add a few more jokes than those two, and a little too many of them have a frat bro/trying-to-be alpha dog mentality that can be a little exhausting. Still overall, it's pretty funny. <br/><br/>There are some really impressive and violent fights. Current film technology is utilized to have the Predators do things they couldn't in previous films.<br/><br/>The cast is all-around likable. Heck, I think this is the first time I found Olivia Munn fully utilized in a film.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the pacing can be a little uneven at moments. There are moments where the back-and-forth between characters could've been shorter and the scenes are rushed, including a death of a main character that's bkubj-and-miss. Also, the final scene setting up the sequel feels tacked-on and inorganic.<br/><br/>Listen, if you're not interested in a humorous Predator film than this won't be for you. Personally, I went to be mindlessly entertained, and I was."
444,4," What is with all the hate ? I saw this film on the big screen and loved it. Yes it's over the top and bloody as all get out but I like that in my Predator films. Non stop action and a good cast keep me wanting more from start to end. Boyd Holbrook as Quinn McKenna the bad ass Ranger was a good choice. Olivia Munn as the scientist who gets called in to help, is a plus for any movie and she is great in action films anyway.<br/>I am looking forward to the next Predator film. Give it a chance."
445,4," It was a fun experience, and it didn't take itself to seriously. Though I think it should of had more horror aspects too it, we got what it was advertised to us as."
446,3," When an 11 year old is a better actor than the rest of the cast. THE Predator, not to be confused with its 1987 Schwarzenegger progenitor simply called Predator, is a poor bit of Sci-Fi, middling piece of action, and a pretty good comedy. If you stop to think about the plot moves for 1 second, it falls apart so badly that your brain hurts. This movie could be subtitled 100 cool / gory / juvenile / brutal and outlandish ways for people and aliens to die. That's why we go, and that is what it delivers. The best part is the comedy chemistry. The big names are Trevante Rhodes (Moonlight) ,Olivia Munn, Keegan-Michael Key and Thomas Jane. None is really stretching acting muscles here. The lead actor Boyd Holbrook is passable if not terribly charismatic. And after a pretty good recent run of movies, it feels like Sterling K Brown lost a bet. Collectly the team, the ""loonies"" is what gives this movie its enjoyablity factor. <br/><br/>The Predator (movie) plays a little fast and loose with mental conditions for the sake of entertainment. I don't want to seem stuffy, so I say enjoy and give it a pass. This brings me to young actor Jacob Tremblay (Wonder) who's ""damage"" this time is one on the autism spectrum, Asperger's Syndrome. Jacob does a knockout job of it. As a plot device, it is still ludicrous but he did good. The Predator (movie) is stupid with some so-so to very good special effects, but because of the cast collectively I could go see it again. And presuming that these movies are not too costly to make, and the box office is modestly good, we should see a number of them in the future. Which leaves us who liked this one with an obvious problem. <br/><br/>How does the scientist come up with a mumbo-jumbo explanation using a 6th grade desktop microscope, and how did that microscope just suddenly show up on an 45 year old RV? GAHHH!"
447,1," I write this review with a heavy heart. I have been a fan for 30 years. I knew things were not looking good when the trailers were released. Shane Black was handed something great, he could have kicked started a franchise that would have the fans salivating. Instead, he gives us this pathetic comedy. The writing was good it really was. The acting was terrible. The one-liners reminded me of Tango and Cash from many years ago. The movie was all over the place never made any sense. I was so disappointed and let down. The stupidity and acting were up there with the last Transformers movie. Shane has ruined it. Could have been so good. Wait for the Redbox, don't pay theatre prices."
448,3," Hey it's a predator movie. I enjoyed it. Watch it, make your opinion."
449,4," Same quick one liners with bigger and better creatures. The directing and writing were spot on, casting was steller and effects integrated the original with modern day technology with twists that made me panic."
450,0, I fell asleep literally no less than three times during this drek and walked out for about ten minutes. If I hadn't been with friends I would have left for sure. Horrible.
451,3," The first Predator film maybe one of the most enjoyable Sc-fi Action Horrors of all time. Maybe Arnie's best film or at least one of them. So let's be honest trying to make the fans boys of the original happy ain't gonna be easy. <br/><br/>Shane Black as penned some great screenplays, including Lethal Weapon which is one of my all time favourite films. He usually as films with strong characters, great dialogue and humour. So with him at the helm of a new Predator movie its a winning formula right?<br/><br/>What we got in the end was a somewhat bonkers crazy film with lots of pace, action, gore and violence. Lots of humour that hits and miss. A plot that makes no fuckin sense, plenty of moments that are good and plenty of moments that don't really work. The screenplay seems like it was written by a few guys who were high on cocaine. Frantic and all over the place but still the film was weirdly enjoyable, good but not great. <br/><br/>The final act apparently was reshot and it's pretty messy. How can a Dr jump on buses and have soldier like skills? The first Predator comes back to help us yet ends up killing fifty people in the process? Can people hang on to a flying space ship? How the fuck does the Predator see bodyheat with no helmet? The Predators intends to weaponise autism? What the fuck happened to the government guy in the final act? Looked like he blew his own head off? Did Ironman turn up at the end? <br/><br/>Anyways ..... Enjoyable B movie Sc-fi action film that just about works, too many ideas and bit messy may have been better. But I'll give Shane Black credit for least going slightly different route."
452,4, Watched it today and thought it was entertaining. Not as good as the origional preditor film but i say its better then the past few preditor movies that have been released.
453,3, It was a fun popcorn movie.
454,0, Worst of what i expected
455,5," Now that is how you make a predator hardcore and fun. The predator is what I expect for a sci-fi film a awesome,fun, and hardcore action horror and this does it right with a little change and here's why. The film has a bright tone this time around and you don't see that in the other predator films but in a way I like it I mean sure it does have a dark tone still but with a mix of a bright tone that's awesome plus the film has humor this time and the humor is spot on good humor and really funny jokes too I like that overall. The story is good a little confusing but good it really dives in more about why the creature takes skulls and spines for trophy's in the first plus I also like how they talk about the first and second film and how they now about the predator in the first place now that is cool and interesting. Now the characters are very lovable I like the new character Quinn he is a tough one and a good leader he is very different then Dutch,Mike,Royce and Isabelle all of them are super tough but Quinn he is different but I like the character plus all of the other characters are lovable too and of course again my favorite alien still the predator he looks even more bad ass then before with his again his weapons blade launcher, disc blades, and my favorite weapon the plasma cannon he was so cool in this one and also I have to talk about the new predator ""the ultimate predator"" he was massive and deadly but also bad ass as well I like that so much both of the predators where awesome looking and deadly as fuck. the last thing I have to talk about is the hardcore action every predator film has to have hardcore horror action and this one deliver it perfectly and it was over-the-top the scenes were awesome and the violence was very hardcore with blood spreading every where and of course it was suspenseful like very suspenseful that's how you make a predator film hardcore action-packed sci-fi horror and they nail it good. Overall The predator was a fun and hardcore sci-fi action horror film with a brighter tone, lots of humor this time, a well good story, very lovable characters and awesome hardcore action-packed scenes and suspenseful as well plus the predator again proves that he still got it and its one of my favorite alien creature of all time and you what I don't care people say about this film, this film is good and awesome and I can wait for the next one I hope they make because I love these films to death. Well done Shane black you directed a well made and fun action-packed sci-fi horror film and it was great to see the predator again on the screen and keeping the formula of these films well balance and scary and I hope the next film will be awesome and fun as well. awesome job and well done and I can believe I am going to say this again always remember this quote ""YOU'RE ONE UGLY MOTHERFUCKER"" still it never gets old. PREDATOR RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!."
456,4, This movie is very good and far better than Predator 2. I enjoyed this approach with humor and the direction they decided to go. First movie was classic and no other sequel will ever be as good. Predators and The Predator very solid movie that is given a bad ref because most people are missing out on the obvious. Reason why predator and alien movies did so well at the beginning was because nobody knew much about them. They were wrapped in mystery and that made them scary and fresh. Lots of info has been added to both species so its hard to get the same in your face terror and mystery. I for one hope there is another movie set on their home planet. Not a serious movie and it works. I for one will be watching it again on dvd and enjoying the ride for what it is.<br/>Relax people!
457,0," Too bad, because this could have been a great movie, but the storyline is so <br/>ridiculous that it could almost be mistaken for a spoof. The plot is basically a weird combination of Predator 2 and the 1989 movie The Dream Team (both of which were better movies than this movie)."
458,4," I give it 4 out of 5 skulls...a most see if ya are a fan of ANY Predator movies, man!"
459,0," This movie is not in the same vein as the previous movies in the sense that there is no real dread or sense of intensity for the most part. That said, the characters are often very funny but a little over the top with the craziness. Additionally, no team can match the character of the first film but this team isn't trying to. Shane Black has created his own unique team that complements each other somewhat effectively for the most part, and far better than the subsequent characters created for the series, besides maybe Bill Paxton in the second film. The action is fairly standard, the editing can be a bit choppy, and most of the characters have little development outside of humor driven dialogue but it doesn't hinder the movie much either. This is a standard popcorn flick and should be approached as such. Worth a single viewing at the very least."
460,0, What a joke. I'm so glad Sinemia footed the bill. Unnecessary stupid one line jokes and HORRIBLE CGI. I've seen 12 year olds do better. DO NOT watch in D-Box completely lacking enough action to get your money's worth. Wait for it to come out and hit the $1 bin at Walmart.
461,0," Absolute stinker. Stupid writers must be suffering from congenital COPROLALIA &amp;/or TOURETTE'S SYNDROME. Hardly a sentence spoken without gratuitous, unnecessary F- &amp; MF BOMS! Even among 'professionals', including 'ladies', in presumably professional settings.<br/>And being a story mostly for KIDS, they even had the little boy mouth a MF-boms. If they ever show this movie on regular TV and cut out all the FBombs it would be half as long. Well, F these Hollywood MFers. <br/>The movie had a few visually good scenes, but it was a total letdown. We were groaning and waiting for the end. <br/>Oh, and the 'rag tag group of brain fried good guys' had absolutely no qualms about murdering whatever American servicemen got in their way.<br/>And OLIVIA MUMM on opening week was complaining that someone in the cast was a SEX OFFENDER/PREDATOR. WHO precisely? The guy in the PREDATOR SUIT???<br/>And, BTW, wouldn't it be tempting, maybe easy, to just grab and break off one of crab/lobster legs around his mouth? Wouldn't that hurt?<br/>I'm giving it a 1/2 star, cuz can't go any lower."
462,3," It was surprisingly watchable. It could have been a great movie if the final act was thought out better, but it starts to fall apart towards the end as sense leaves the building and silliness takes over. It was funny, entertaining, with good action until midway through the final forest fight and then the film just goes a bit mental and it is hard to stay on board."
463,4, Felt like an 80s action film. Refreshing in today's climate where everything has to be so serious and grounded.
464,0," Where it lack in suspense unlike the original it certainly makes up for in action The Predator is An immensely entertaining film, there may be a few issues with the plot and I'm under no illusion that this is a movie masterpiece. You didn't come here for an extremely detailed and moving story. You came here to see aliens kill things in fun ways which it achieves in flying colours"
465,5," Action packed, fun-filled, and a laugh-riot all the way through. This definitely is the best film in the franchise since AVP; most comparable to Ragnarok. Ignore the critics."
466,3," I feel that sometimes nostalgia allows us to look back more favorably on films a generation passed. As a huge fan of the iconic original I think we need to remember that it is hardly a ground breaking piece of cinema rather than a awesome cat and mouse action flick with muscles, guns, a killer alien and more one liners than you can shake a stick at.<br/><br/>And so when I came to this film I feel as though my expectations were already reasonably well managed, in fact after hearing murmurings that the film isn't that good I'd say they were sufficiently low. But in my humble opinion this film was great send up to the Arnie original.<br/><br/>The story is relatively simple with some interesting twists leaving the spot light shining on the fantastic cast. The action scenes are great and gory set pieces worthy of the original but most of all it really encapsulated the atmosphere of the original film.<br/><br/>This film exceeded not because my expectations were low but because it was simply a great Predator movie. It's not ground breaking, the writing won't win any Oscars. But it excels at being taught, fun and gory roller coaster. Strap in, firmly suspend your disbelief and enjoy!"
467,0, I've been a life long fan of the franchise this was by far the absolute worst. I'd go into detail but I don't have the engry to waste. Just know I won't be going to see the sequel to this mess.
468,4, Another excellent movie.
469,0," Horrible movie, worst Predator movie I ever watched."
470,4, A delightful twist to a classic tale.
471,4," It was a good addition to the predator movies. With any movie it is not perfect, but every one is different, just cause one person hates sonething does not mean everyone will. The biggest thing i would have liked better would have been to have kept the predator loar simple, all they want are hunting trophys. It did not need to make a silly reason like genetically modifying themselves as reason to hunt. But that aside still had the classic predator feel and well laid out omage's"
472,1, Left the cinema one hour into the movie.
473,1, ?????? ????? ? ??? ?? ?????
474,4," If you're looking for an Oscar-Worthy movie, this is definitely not it. If you're looking for an action movie with pretty mindless entertainment (which I what I usually go to see movies for), then look no further. It was exactly what I expected from the Predator series of movies with a plot line that seemed to want to unify all of the movies in the series together in a decently clever way. I think that the movie did a pretty good job of this. After the original Predator movie, this is the next best. Suspend being judgement and just enjoy the movie for what it is."
475,2, As a Fan of the original its sad to see a truly terrifying Saga turn into a comedy. Literally the movie theater laughed multiple times. Just was not dark enough or scary.
476,2," Good for the gore, but that's about it. Lacks most of what made the original special and is a laughably terrible movie as a whole. Enjoyable watch, bad movie."
477,2," Well, I didn't hate it, and it is probably about the 3rd best of the Predator movies, but yeah, that isn't saying much...<br/><br/>Be forewarned, there are some spoilers coming, but know that there aren't really that many surprises in the movie. All the same, avoid this review if you are going to watch it in the near future.<br/><br/>So first, the good things.<br/>This movie is a great call-back to the original. Some fun action scenes, some really funny scenes and lines, and at no point does it take itself too seriously. If you are of the type that can shut down all cognitive processes when you sit down to a film, then you will have a great time. If not, then wincing through some of the rougher parts is worth it if you like action-scifi shoot-em-ups.<br/><br/>Group 2 is amazing. I really enjoyed each of the characters, though a few don't get quite as much love as others. Key is on point with the funnies and the rest are great follow-through on the jokes. Good stuff.<br/><br/>Yvonne Strahovski's Emily McKenna is really really good. Easily one of my favorite characters.<br/><br/>Brown's Traeger is a fun antagonist, though he goes from something interesting to a bit of a caricature towards the end. His final scene is stupid and so easy to miss that it has a Coen-like quality.<br/><br/>Rory is a great character, and I think the boy is well-played (give or take). I don't blame the actor, he did what he could with the material he was given.<br/><br/>The plot had potential. I'll just leave it at that.<br/><br/>Now, the bad things, of which there are many. I will say that while the negatives greatly outweigh the positives, I don't hate the movie in the way I some fan-pandering films. Still, some of these are so cringe-worthy it can be tough to power through.<br/><br/>The plot, while an interesting idea with lots of potential, is pretty much discarded right out of the gate. What was lined up to be a really interesting predator/human alliance is immediately thrown out the door when the ""good guy"" starts stringing people up from trees. Just dumb. Could have been so good too.<br/><br/>Oh. My. God. is the CGI awful. I mean truly 2001-era awful. I have not seen a professional movie have this poorly an animation staff in a very very long time. It just doesn't make any sense to make a movie this ""blockbustery"" with below TV-level animation. To make matters worse, they animate waaaay too much. Things that could very easily have been done with live FX are lazily slapped together using what looks like a free trial of software written in Bangladesh (no offense Bangladesh, I'm sure you have some fantastic coders somewhere). It is so bad that it is distracting throughout the entire film. All the best parts of the movie are those that don't have a predator in them.<br/><br/>Munn's Dr. Brackett is not a value-added component of this movie. The part calls for some braininess, some humor, some Campbell-esque personal development, and a bit of action heroine-ness. She pulls off exactly none of these. Remember how bad Psilocke was in Apocolypse? Yep, dial that up to 11. I have heard a few claim she has some great acting chops, but I just haven't seen it anywhere. Ming-Na Wen would have so much better for this role!!! To say her character is wooden is an understatement. I love just about every movie the Keanu Reeves has ever been in, so trust me, I have a very high tolerance, but just wow.<br/><br/>The predator is bullet-proof, except when he isn't. It would have been impossible to create a tactical plan on how to deal with the predator throughout this movie given how utterly arbitrary his survivability is. Nothing about the predator's powers, reactions, fighting ability, none of it, is consistent in any way. Combine this with the bad CGI and the copious amounts of (bad CGI) blood, and you have some of the worst predators in any of the films. The first predator also oscillates between super massive/weighty to normal human mass/weight, and from super strong, to pretty strong, to OMG that was Hulk-level strong and doesn't even sort of make sense. The super Predator is even worse.<br/><br/>You don't get to ogle any of the cool gear. One of the things that has always been great about the Predator franchise is the sweet alien tech. Their unique gear, each a little different from the last is what makes the aliens fun and interesting. This would probably be true this time too, if you ever got a chance to see any of it. The bits you get aren't fun, and the bits that are fun are so badly worked up into the CGi that you can't enjoy it.<br/><br/>The finale was anything but. I just can't get out of my head how dumb the last scene, which should have been hella cool, turned out to be.<br/><br/>Finally, the first scene of the movie will look very similar to anyone who has played Alpha Centauri Alien Crossfire.<br/><br/>Ok, with that off my chest, I will say that if you like the mythos, it is a worthy installment. The cringe-factor can be high, but if you have the stones to power through it, I recommend it. I'm not sure the big screen is a necessity, since I imagine some of the CGI awfulness will be minimized on a TV set."
478,0," Fan since the first movie and every sequel and even the AVP spin offs showed and explained mpre ofcthe Predators race and clans etc. This movie pissed on all of it!<br/>The idea of two rival Predators is fun and the fights look good. 1 star.<br/>Dogs were completely unnecessary! The boy walking around on Halloween in his gear was ridiculous... I could forgive this.<br/>But the last 10 minutes.... OMFG!!!<br/><br/>Really like the character design, the cast had potential but the script and plot holes kiled the franchise!<br/>Really killed it. So disappointed about Shane Black!!! Cant describe....<br/>He wrote and directed great movies... this is a COMPLETE FAILURE!!!<br/>Spoiler: Iron Man appears in the final scene!"
479,3, Comedy sci-fi which will entertain you through the boring parts. But this has to be the last film they do before they kill predator off
480,0," A-Team meets Predator works at some level and the 'hybridization' is an interesting concept, but the 'Casey Bracket' character was a waste and the resolution ending is as ridiculous as the one for 'Independence Day Resurgence'. There was no attempt to advance the franchise, it is just another parody-homage movie"
481,0, Predators is better.
482,5," It's what fans wanted and no fans hate, hence the ratings. Thanks for making what we wanted"
483,2," It's been a formula where a film looks great, sounds great, but it never tries as hard as it should. In fact, with this film, it comes off as lazy. Laziness comes in the unorganized plot points of the film that are poorly tied together, mixing in so many story cliches that even I could predict, like when the predator is tied down I thought to myself ""Of course, he's gonna break through and kill everyone."" And that's exactly what happens. They even through in a few pointless three-act scenes that nobody would really need to care about since the characters aren't engaging. In fact, I couldn't even make out not only their names, but even what the characters were saying for nearly a third of the time! I swear it was like the actors all did this on a late Sunday night while chugging down a cup of coffee. The film ends so abruptly, and the title I feel was put onto screen too early(and too carelessly). Plus, something I don't understand in these movies is that when a predator loses his arm, how come he doesn't agonize in pain? Are they just resistant to pain in this area? There are genuine scenes I find both funny and clever, like the predator using the arm to give a thumbs up, and with two of the annoying and offensive side characters helping to end their suffering at the end by shooting each other. Outside of that, it's a cliched and annoying predator movie that honestly makes me want to see the amount of time on the human characters flip with the predators themselves. Why can't they get the spotlight?"
484,0," Cohesive storytelling is none existent. This is one of those movies that tried so hard to follow the humor trend of blockbuster movies nowadays it just fall flat on it's face. The story is a complete disrespect to the lore , especially with predators. This is easily the most dissapointed film I have seen this year, trust me, it just not worth your time."
485,4, I really enjoyed this one. <br/><br/>A massive improvement from AVP movies and a great edition to the franchise. Looking forward to more sequels.
486,3," One thing that hardcore fans of the franchise seems to hate and that I found absolutely brilliant about the movie is that it doesn't try to mimic any of his predecessors. Shane Blake a director with a strong and clear vision on how to approach an entertainment flick, manages to deliver a fast paced action comedy without a hint of revivalist nostalgia. A great cast also contributes to the unbridled and juvenile fun that this movie embodies (tons of gore that will not disappoint the younger generations). I dare to say, a group of rogue veteran soldiers who are way better constructed and assembled that the original group of Schwarzenegger and an assortment of cartoonish characters (Jesse Ventura's Blain or Sonny Landham's highly stereotypical native American). The movie as expected for a sequel has its clear flaws starting from a hardly believable government scientist played by Olivia Munn that miraculously turns into acrobat fighter in the blink of an eye and that doesn't really cover any particularly significative role in the story. Another aspect where the movie only half succeed would have to be on his sci fi elements. Where the idea of giving a new spin to the Predators saga(the Predators evolutionary scientific efforts) is definitely fresh and interesting, some sci fi elements seems to be a bit redundant and gratuitous: Predators Dogs all of the sudden being brought to earth?, Humans being completely comfortable with alien tech? A few question mark will surely popped up in your head if you are even a casual aficionado of the genre. Nonetheless ""The Predator"" hits the mark of an original sequel that doesn't disappoint and doesn't bore one minute."
487,5," Good news for Predator fans,<br/><br/>Critic trolls gave this a low score because its not the....<br/><br/>... KIDDIE DISNEY STAR Wars LAST Jedi SEQUEL!!!<br/><br/><br/>*The movie is NOT COMEDIC full of jokes DISNEY MICKEY MOUSE KIDDIE STYLE like the paid critics are saying.<br/><br/>*There were only few JOKES in the movie and all of them were HILARIOUS!<br/><br/>* Soldiers with psychological problems talk differently and sometimes it sounds funny, but its accurate. Not too much comedy just crazy talk from crazy soldiers.. <br/><br/>* Even normal soldiers that talk with each other say crazy things. Shane did a great job dialogue wise. <br/><br/>* There was ONE JOKE that was CRAZY MINDBLOWING (Trick or Treat part of the movie)<br/><br/>* Action packed suspensful all the way.... <br/><br/>* THE END IS FANTASTIC<br/><br/>* Lots of shocking awesome moments too ESPECIALLY THE END!<br/><br/>* And the quality of CG was excellent . -- Better than Mickey Mouse kiddy Avengers and Star Wars and Solo, Star Wars movie<br/><br/> I will be defending this movie forever."
488,0," Lousy script, bad direction and poor performances. It' s a waste of a great creture."
489,0, Haha. I made an account just to warn people. Don't wante your money on this trash.
490,0," There are no redeeming qualities for this absolute disaster of a movie. The action is sloppy, and poorly executed,the movie looks cheap and outdated, the humor mostly falls flat, and the writing is abysmal. On top of that, the movie hops from scene to scene almost every minute without any cohesion or structure and what we have is a rushed, clobbered together mess that lacks any suspense or excitement other than one bad action scene after another with dick jokes sprinkled in."
491,5," Soooo good!!! It had quality story writing, inventive action scenes etc. <br/><br/> ""AND THAT'S WHAT SUPER HEROES DO!!!!"" -- THOR Ragnorak 92% RT score <br/><br/>Thor's DUMBEST ONE LINER THROUGHOUT MOVIE and critics thought it was brilliant ... anything Disney does is brilliant.<br/><br/>SO It feels like critics ONLY want people to see DUMB DUMB DISNEY movies.<br/><br/>- Solo a Star Wars story 2018 - 71%<br/>- Star Wars Last Jedi 2017 - 91%<br/>- Ant-Man and the Wasp 2018 - 89%<br/>- Avengers Infinity War 2018 - 89 %<br/>- Thor of Ragnorak 2018 92%<br/><br/>*** Critics don't want people to watch other good movies ***<br/><br/>*The Predator 2018 - 34% score<br/>*Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom - 48% score<br/>* Equalizer 2 2018 - 50% score<br/>* Predator 2, 1990 - 25%<br/><br/>DISNEY the ONLY STUDIO that can AFFORD to PAY CRITICS for absurd high praises reviews for the poor quality too. <br/><br/><br/>***** It's OK if you wait for it on NETFLIX ******<br/><br/><br/>... you will see how good the movie really<br/><br/>... and you will see that CRITICS ARE LIARS.<br/><br/><br/>Predator will win <br/><br/>Critics will keep loosing their credibility...<br/><br/><br/>And no one will ever trust critics again!!! :)"
492,2, Wasn't gritty like Predator or Predators. To much comedy for an R-rated Action Flick. Otherwise decent cast in an not-so-decent movie.
493,1, Insipid. Cliche. Bad acting. Poor writing.
494,5," Predator is back and looks new and tasty. If you like the old films, you probably like and new one. Hurry up and take your comrades with you, to join you at this adventure. Shane Black, you did it"
495,5," The best of the movie:<br/>- Alien vs. Predator is now officially part of the franchise.<br/>- They have clarified the true intentions of predators convincingly.<br/>- It's very bloody.<br/>- A lot of good action.<br/>- The reasoning against the asperguer, as a new step in the evolution of the human being.<br/>- The jokes are not a problem, Even one of them has influence on the plot (bus escape) and others are just great (such as the severed arm joke).<br/>- The movie espects the Predator's code, for example when it does not attack the naked doctor because she is not a threat."
496,4," Nothing new, but it's still fun, quite unexpectedly so. A solid piece of entertainment. Mind you, this is coming from a die hard fan of the original. And don't mind the ratings here -- it's not half as bad as they say."
497,4," Make up your own mind. To me, a fun, entertaining film."
498,1," Maybe not a complete hot mess, but certainly hard to find any characters to latch onto and feel empathy for. Director seems to believe that having an autistic child in the movie would get us to latch on. Really needs much more character development."
499,1, I have seen it yesterday in the preview and it is so disappointing. I agree with Johnny Oleksinski from the New York Post. 1 Star only or 2 out of 10
500,2, One redundant motherfucker...
501,1, Cinematically beautiful. But spent more time annoyed than entertained. Offensive jokes muddied the chuckle worthy moments. Characters with no souls motivation or compassion. Bad acting direction and script all around.
502,1," Where do I start? the opening scene with an alien ship flying in...you could almost see the string holding it up. The acting was a joke for most of the movie, as I found myself laughing out loud. Do not waste your time or money on this one, wait for Netflix!"
503,5, I have seen all Predator movies. This one pushes the story line along which I love! I could have done without the excessive blood and gore. I will go see the next one.
504,5, I'm glad this isn't a reboot but rather a continuation of the original Predator movie.
505,0, I'm speechless. The ending was as close to the return of Uber Jason in Jason X. Please don't make a sequal and give the movie to blumhouse to make right. So much potential with the story and the horrible CGI that came from 2004 decided to kill also all momentum when the second predator was introduced with his dogs.
506,5, 10/10 recommend. it's fresh and funny for a sci-fi movie.
507,2," Too many character holes and the editing made the movie feel like one long trailer for the last scene. What makes the Predator series good is suspense, not levity. The movie fails to deliver through the plot or through its characters."
508,5," First off, this is a comedy 100%! Think of Starship Troopers meets Independance day with violent Predators. It's a social gathering movie, so gather the troops soldier!<br/><br/>Gather up your friends, get under the influence...and go see this film! It literally had the whole theater in tears. The script is there, but honestly it didnt really matter...the movie doesnt take itself serious and it was a good ride. <br/><br/>Random motorcycles, check.<br/>Random helicopter, check.<br/>Jake Busey (Gary Busey's son)...some might remember Gary in Predator 2...check.<br/>An awesome time, check!!!!!"
509,3, Went to watch this movie because olivia munn. was not DISAPPOINTED. surprisingly funny.
510,0," This movie was by far the worst addition to the Predator Franchise. I get that the film industry has just become a cash grab of what shit hole movie you can pump out and attach a better, older movie's background to, but this one was absurd. The entire movie was awful but the last act fell off a fucking cliff. Who the hell edited this? I felt like AVP was a better inclusion of Predator lore and background then this POS... DOn't bother giving your hard earned money to this monstrosity."
511,0," Absolutely terrible. Had some funny moments but other than that it was horrendous. Bad dialogue, bad story, terrible editing, 90's cgi. Its no surprise to me because this movie was directed by the guy who made iron man 3. Save your money and pirate this film if you really want to watch it. Olivia Munn is hot tho."
512,3," Greatly exceeded my low expectations. It's a really good time. Excellent ensemble, fun action, great sense of humor. Just enough fan service without feeling cheap and hollow. The low Tomatometer is a shame. It's much better than that."
513,0, Just an awful movie in an amazing franchise.... Predators deserves a sequel.
514,0," Predator movies have always had their fair share of schlock, but still found ways to show some seriousness and respect for the core material. Not this garbage. Pure schlock and I hope it tanks."
515,1, Disappointing film. While it starts off decently the third act is a complete mess and seems rushed and confusing.
516,5," Worth seeing, very entertaining. And funny!!"
517,0, Only positive thing we're a few of the mom jokes in a single scene.
518,5, With the critics weighing in poorly in an action/sci-fi series that has sucked in recent memory. The new Predator delivers in a fun-filled predator vs. predator vs. human and adds to some much needed color on the series. Do not believe the haters and the critics that told you Transformers X sucks then you go watch it and like it. Same thing here! The movie is fun to watch on the big screen.
519,1, Worst of the predator series. Shane Black should be barred from making any movies.
520,3," The final act killed it..but overall very entertaining, funny... and gory movie"
521,5, its a veri nice brutal movie after other idiotic predators
522,3," I've been a fan of Predator since the 1st one. Enjoyed this movie, but expect a different tone than the original movies. It doesn't take itself too seriously but still packed with the action/gore that made the original great."
523,5," The movie was perferct, loved the story. Of course Predator (1987) is a classic but I think Black did a great job with this one. There are similiraties with the one from 1987 which makes it well thought out. I think The Predator 2018 is better than the ones made before it , leaving John McTiernan's aside of course."
524,0," No plot, bad writing, and way to many f-bombs. Horrible movie, save your money."
525,5, VEry good HAS ITS DOWNS BUT O BOY ITS UPS
526,1," As a massive Predator fan (I've enjoyed every single film that features this iconic alien to various levels of enjoyment), this film was a gigantic disappointment in every fathomable way. I honestly felt that with Writer/Director Shane Black, who was part of the cast of the original '87 classic and someone with an impeccable track record so far, that this could be the film that would be a return to form in some way. However, it ended up being probably the worst of all the solo Predator films and maybe, just maybe, a little better than Alien vs Predator: Requiem. The writing is classic Shane Black, which would be fantastic in a movie like The Nice Guys, but here it just causes a whole lot of tonal whiplash with every character being a comedian in some way. The classic, practical Predator is pretty much replaced with a CGI - 'super' Predator which quite frankly, sucks and the storyline is fundamentally flawed and not to mention a slap to the face of Predator fans. I haven't been this disappointed by a film since Batman v Superman and that's saying a lot.<br/>You broke my (and my cousin, who's as big a Predator fan as I am) heart Shane Black :("
527,5, Actually a good Predator movie. This is only 2nd to Predator 2. If you dislike this movie then you're either not a fan of the Predator Universe or you have crap taste in movies. This was a fun ride with laughs all the way through.
528,4, Good movie with plenty of action an continuation of the predator story <br/>Don't take all these negative scores to heart it's a predator movie you can't expect a crazy storyline and depth it's just action an cool aliens take that for what it is ENJOY IT
529,0, Worst movie I've seen in years. Save your money.
530,4," Entertaining sci-fi, with plenty of action. If you like the other Predator movies, this will please you. This movie is exactly what it is supposed to be. Gotta love these beta-male hater critics who favor love stories, critiquing a genre they can't stand."
531,5, best predator movie<br/>I can't wait for the next one.
532,0, Worst predator film ever
533,2," Another missed opportunity for the Predator franchise. It's no wonder Arnold Schwarzenegger turned down a role in this movie. Let me get to the good news first: The Predator is very entertaining...because the cast of ""misfits"" that fight him have great chemistry together and give the movie a sense of humor (yes you heard right, ""comedy"" in a Predator film). In fact, this group would have even done great in the 1st Predator film. However, the story is garbage, reminding me just how stupid and devoid of logic the Alien v Predator movies were. But don't worry, if you can turn off your brain and pretend you're watching an action movie written in 1995, then by all means, enjoy this cheese fest. The studio wasted some really good Predator action scenes, CGI and a really entertaining cast on this trash of a script. I would definetly pay to see these guys work together again, unfortunately their talents had to be used on this garbage. Final Review: 6 out of 10. Score would be a 3, but again, some of the cast (misfits from the bus) was just so damn entertaining and funny. But is comedy in a Predator film a good thing? Well, enjoy the cheese or just ""get to da choppa!"""
534,3," While the sci-fi action is all good fun, when it comes to nearly every other aspect of the film, it's sloppy and hollow. Still, the action's what we came for isn't it?"
535,0, The film is a mess of ideas and concepts that go nowhere. The writing and acting are atrocious. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. It is truly overshadowed by the original.
536,4," For all the critics that mention the lack of horror and the machismo as negatives, do you even remember the origin of this series? The original Predator was not a horror at all. You're referencing the bad Alien v. Predator series, as those lined up closer to horror. And were terrible. This film follows the original's style. Sorry, but the world needs something that's not PC every so often. And these are military toughs, have you ever been around soldiers that don't talk inappropriate shit? I get it if you don't like the flick, fine. But to put it on BS that you had expectations of genre and humor that has already been established otherwise makes you bad at your job. Get over yourselves, over 100 bad reviews is absurd."
537,5," Would normally give this a 4, but since people are pooping on it for ludicrous reasons I'll give it another point. Enjoyable movie, on par with Predators. Added some new lore, and left itself open for a sequel. The cast was amazing. My only complaint is it was a little too comedic. But instead of The Last Jedi, the comedy was actually funny and well placed."
538,1," as a mega fan of Predator, I must say I'm very disappointed, and I wish this movie was never made. Period. The plot and dialogue are terrible and gave me the impression that it's a fan work written by some teenager. what idiot approved this transcript? :("
539,5," Pay no attention to the bad reviews. Those people are stupid. Make note of them for future reference.<br/>This flicker is not stop awesome! Filled with humor, but not over the top or trying too hard. Score is perfect, but not over the top or trying too hard. Cinematography alone is worth the price of admission.<br/>The film looks wonderful, not overly digital. It is perfectly paced as it moves quickly. None of that over the top lull before the storm crap. We all know what we're about to see, we don't need them trying to recreate the previous films. (which all kind of sucked anyway. Even the original. Arnold? Please.)<br/><br/>This feature is perfectly cast. How often can you say that about a big budget film? The chemistry between the characters settles nicely. The humor had me laughing out loud, and I never laugh out loud.<br/>The action is again, perfect. The effects are so sweet and seamless. They don't show us every money shot from 5 different angles. Again, perfect. <br/><br/>What's best about this film is not so much what they did, but what they didn't do. They didn't fall over themselves making sure to put in a plethora of one liners. Or making sure to mention all the previous efforts. Unless you thought about it, you might not have noticed the son of Gary Busey's former character ""Keyes"" being played by Gary Busey's son Jake Busey. It was fun noticing such things!<br/>Everyone performed perfectly."
540,2," wow wat a trash. Back in the day, it took Arnie and a whole squad of men to try to take on just one. Now 10 yr old kid and the scientist walking with dog in the park can take on predator by easeð~,ð~,. The only good thing abt the movie is Shane black dialogues, other than that there's nothing fucking in this nonsense"

542,5," OK! So I'm reviewing The Predator. First off let me say one thing, if you came to this film looking for an acting or cinematic masterpiece you need to fuck off to another theatre. It's not a film that needs to be taken seriously, it's directed by Shane Black, the guy who made all of the lewd vagina jokes in the first film. If you accept that this film is going to be schlock then you can actually enjoy it. The humor is urnealistic and crude but it fits this film and the universe perfectly. I would have honestly given theis film a 4/5 but the number of, ""this film is unrealistic and doesn't take itself serious enough"" reviews pushes me to give it a 5/5."
543,5," One critic was saying they have no investment in the characters is completely idiotic. The movie was awesome and I loved it. The question is; ""am I entertained?"" The answer is absolutely!"
544,3," Spoilers**<br/><br/> I am a huge Predator fan, but as a Predator movie this is the weakest. The action was good, the comedy actually mostly worked. However the plot was terrible and unnecessary as well as comical. The kid with Aspergers helping out was weak and more unrealistic than the anything. I didn't like the translating of what the Predators were saying, the rogue Predator to save earth was dumb. The ultimate Predator was not needed either. The character Predator is itself badass, and scary on its own, there's no reason to try to make it bigger. They did that in Predators already. The Predator dogs were awful. They were better in Predators. The ""Loonies"" were great overall, Olivia Munn was trash. The ending was so cheesy and terrible. Shane Black did a terrible job. The movie was fun for what it was but not a good Predator movie."
545,3," For the most part, The Predator is funny, brutal, and full of blasts. On the other hand, it lacks the original narrative that might lose what the audiences expected. Overall, a good start for upgrading."
546,0, everything about this movie disgustingly bad.
547,2," No where near as good as the original, but not as bad as AVP, not worth paying for it at the cinema."
548,0, Such an average act. I will not recommend this to anyone who wants to see real fighting
549,4," I had low expectations for The Predator, but it turned out to be a worthy sequel, and not a rehash, with fairly good new characters and dialogue and more comedy. Predators with Adrien Brody is still by far the best sequel, though."
550,4, This was way better than the so-called critics said it was.
551,1," A disappointing addition to the series. This film lacks in thrills, suspense, and comprehensive plot. The plot holes are numerous, and the film will leave you thinking, ""wow, that could have been so much better."" I'd wait until it's out on streaming platforms; don't waste your money."
552,1," The film started off promising and then took a real nose dive. All of a sudden it became really poor and im thinking huh! This is unusual. I caught the late show 00:15 hoping for suspense, jungle action and a couple woahs. Any hope of that was buried very early on in the movie from endless dull, irrelevant wtf jokes. The comical aspect was a no from me, a real suspense killer. The story was weak. The acting atrocious. A kids movie. Bamboozled."
553,0, Predator meets national lampoonr horrible CGI waste of money waste of time nothing mean any sense can't tell who killed who terrible terrible movie don't go
554,1," Dissapoitment is an understatement. Plot holes galore, cheesy acting and bad writing overshadow a few good action sequences and pretty good cgi. Dont bother."
555,2, A terrible waste of a great opportunity!
556,5," When I saw the first still pictures of the trailer I said this movie was going to be horrible. However, I saw it today and it was a decent and entertaining scifi flick. I enjoyed it very much. Did it beat Predator 1? No, of course not but still a very entertaining scifi flick. I say check it out if you haven't seen it yet."
557,1," Very silly, with dumb unfunny characters trying to make us laugh throughout the film. It didnt feel like a predator movie, and very little made sense to me, a movie very ungrounded from where it started, even more so than the AVP films."
558,4," If you are a Predator fan, you'll love this movie. It's probably the bloodiest of all the Predator movies but it's definitely worth the watch. If you're looking for fright, this is not for you. The Storyline of the Predator evolving as well as the ending leaves you looking forward to the next film. You also leave with a few questions like: what's up with the dog?"
559,0, A bunch of grown men acting like 14 year old boys and that i supposed to be funny. This is a movie designed for the 14 year old boy market. it isn't funny. It isn't thrilling. it is just a calculated mess.
560,0," If I could rate this lower, I absolutely would. This is an abomination of a film. I'm 99.9% sure this movie made me get an ulcer."
561,5," Movie was alright the story had good details about new development to a newer creature it show how powerful &amp; smart capable the predator is ,just like the original one was from the first film but the most interesting thing from the film was how it shown that predators are developing new growth and, how humans are ready to prepare for war in my opinion that was the important thing from the film."
562,4," A breath of fresh air for the Predator franchise. After numerous films of keeping the predator hidden for a good portion of the movie, ""The Predator"" jumps right into the action delivering a high-paced flick with a cast that works surprisingly well together."
563,0, Terrible. Predator fans will know what I mean. Walked out after 30 minutes.
564,2, Ruim! Muita comédia pra um filme de ação/terror
565,5," A good installment in the franchise, and definitely leaves the door open for another!! Good work for the cast &amp; Crew!"
566,4," I got what I wanted, a fun sci fi action flick that has fun with the premise."
567,0, Was skeptical about this sequel. with so many other predator movies out i did not know if it was going to be worth the watch. But i will tell you it was worth it it makes up for what it may lack and the mix of slight comedy and action gives it a bit of a surprise.
568,5," Anyone who didn't like this movie, didn't know how to laugh."
569,5," Fucking Awesome. Lots of action, lots of gory kills, one-liners, likeable characters with good chemistry, and a plot that makes sense. Stop looking at every movie like it's an Oscar winner and take it for what it is, fun and entertaining."
570,4," This one was very good, interesting action scenes. Predator kept me engaged. Ending is left open for a new sequel this could be amazing."
571,3," The Predator was perfectly fine. It ain't winning any awards, but I love Olivia Munn, and the action was servicable. Boyd Holbrook is hot, so I was mostly entertained."
572,3," Ignore the critics. Who knows what's their REAL problem w/mucho-macho tough-guy action flicks? Yes, it's a B-movie - so was the original! Lighten-up, strap-in &amp; enjoy this - the best of the sequels."
573,2," Too much, roll your eyes stupidly, PC that made no sense. Action scenes were good but when they tried to give the story meaning it just went to 100% BS mode."
574,5, This is a great movie one of the best Predators ever made!
575,4," We get it critics, you want Mickey Mouse to rule the world."
576,5," Better than the original. Dont believe all the liberals reviews who hate soldiers, guns and America. This movie is excellent! All the die hard Predator fans that did not like this movie must dream nightly about Arnolds nut sack!"
577,5, PLEASE IGNORE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!!! That could destroy this franchise. CGI is very excellent and much advanced than previous Predators movie. Very good sci-fi movie. Ticket is vert worth! I am so impressed that kid had very good memory and was able use Predator technology! I want to see sequences of Predator in the future.
578,5," Black charged this chapter with his unique humour and stile. The best thing about this one is that Shane Black didn't try to do the same movie, that everyone tried to redo since 87. Though his big negative is that they changed the whole 3rd act, and judging by all the trailers, the 3rd act could blown us away with all the action, Predator among humans in a car chase, and blowing up whehicles. Sad, but great hopes for the director cut."
579,4, while it has its flaws i believe the predator is a good addition to the film franchise. gone are the days of the DISASTROUS days of avp. predator is not an ILLUSTRIOUS and untouchable franchise.
580,2," This movie was terrible. First off, Shane Black needs to realize that the predator was not to be seen as much as he was. What made the original 2 movies terrifying was the fact that you never saw him. The stealth kills were awesome. To much CGI and humor. Just disappointed."
581,0," Simply disappointing. <br/><br/>Olivia Munn's and ""Roy"" characters made no sense. She a scientist with no military background all of a sudden knows how to shoot multiple types of guns, becomes an expert knife fighter, a kamakzi warrior and a dog whisperer where she manages to befriend a space dog that like to play fetch and manages to return a bomb just at the right time.... twice! Without which they would not have been able to kill the Ultimate Predator. YET, this figure does not get a job at the secret government facility who are analysing the alien cybernetic biotech because the genius kid gets a ""desk"" and is the only one to be able to analyse the tech code. COME ON!! <br/><br/>There's more to say but I will leave it there. <br/><br/>This Predator-come-A-Team-ending in-Iron Man bullshit of a film should have place on top of the dumbass pile of pyrotechnics that were completely overused throughout."
582,1, A 100 minute trailer for the sequel. I wasn't looking for much and got even less than that. The story was weak. What was the small predator's motivation for his initial actions? The crap that they give you when their explanation is forthcoming means that his previous ran counter to his alleged motivation. The human characters were not developed in the least. You learn about them thru exposition so when they die you could really care less. Kind of the way you should feel about this movie.
583,4, Rotten Tomatoes Critics are full of sh..t
584,4," I had fun watching this one. It was what you expect from a predator movie. Cool predators, crazy soldiers lots of action. Glad it had the R rating because it felt like it had a good amount of blood that let you see how aggressive the predators were. Very cool!"
585,4," Dark humor and thrilling action. I loved this movie.<br/><br/>Give this one a shot if you can. If you can't, then watch it when it streams. <br/><br/>And then you will see HOW GOOD THE PREDATOR 2018 really is...<br/><br/>and you will see THAT CRITICS ARE PAID and FULL OF SH....TTT!<br/><br/><br/>Even the wannabee critics on YOUTUBE! Yes them and there fake troll followers are ALL PAID...<br/><br/>- Chris Stuckmann<br/>- Beyond The Trailer <br/>- Grace Randolph<br/>- Jeremy Jahns<br/><br/>All paid to talk crap about the movie. They lied big time.<br/><br/>Soon EVERYONE WILL IGNORE CRITICS... NO ONE WILL TRUST THEM AGAIN"
586,1," I took my nephew to this movie and ended up sleeping thru the entire movie it was so bad. Pooorly written, no actors that I've ever seen in any movie before. I would give it 0 stars if I could."
587,4," Sequels by their very nature are rarely going to be as good as the original. Turning to Predator with the hopes of something resembling Godfather II in terms of enduring quality is a foolish endeavor.<br/>The first Predator was great for what it was. And I'll be honest, I would love for The Predator to have been as much of an action horror blend as the original. But the jokes were funny, the fights were entertaining, and the special effects were serviceable.<br/>Do not go into this movie expecting anything other than an action movie made in 2018 by Shane Black. There are jokes a 13 year old would bust a gut hearing and horrify his parents. There are several spines removed. Sometimes a roller coaster can just be a roller coaster."
588,5, I enjoyed The Predator thought it was an awesome movie. My boyfriend and I went to experience the movie at a 4DX theater and loved it. If you like the predator trilogy this may not be the movie for everyone who is a huge fan of the original like I was highly disappointed with The Nun. Since I love the director James Wan so I know how you all feel. But this movie was awesome.
589,2," Everything about ""The Predator"" sounded like a film geek fever dream , a hard-R <br/> sequel to Predator and throwback to a more simple,minded, gleefully violent and unabashedly entertaining time for action movies written and directed by Shane Black and co-written by Fred Dekker, writer director of the ridiculously underrated horror comedy masterpiece ""Night Of The Creeps"" and kids horror classic ""The Monster Squad"" which he co-wrote with Black, making this their first collaboration since that 1987 gate way drug for kids into the horror genre. Somehow, as per the consistent ineptness of modern studio movie making, none of these mouth watering elements come together and what we're left with is a giant mess of a movie, bits and pieces of a great film scattered over the two hour's of a mostly mediocre one, a runtime that drags like hell even with this movies manic energy. Its really hard to know what went wrong here, this should have been a total fucking slam dunk, i would have bet money on it. From the get go somethings off, even when we're in the midst of a strong scene like the opening, it all still feels under cooked and rushed, like the movie is constantly trying to get somewhere and ending up nowhere. So much of it feels chaotic and muddled, by the end scenes are often unintelligible, at one point a major character dies and, honestly, me and everyone i saw it with were all struggling to remember if we had actually seen his death on screen, or any kind of fate for him in fact, its choppy and murky as fuck. One of the biggest issues behind the scenes was a completely reshot third act, and fuck me does it show, with terrible effects work, editing that renders scenes incoherent and underlit action, its a total headache. Another problem is that it seems Black and Dekker had about four different story ideas, and instead of picking one and settling on it they just piled them all in together, stacked on top of each other until they all fall over, there's a crowded feel to these plotline's that is exhausting, the movie doesnt spend much time in one place before it jumps to something else, never settling long enough to give the thing time to breathe. It really is the most shockingly messy, unpolished big budget studio movie i've seen in a while, it feels like its been butchered down from much longer movie but instead of chopping out inconsequential scenes, they chopped out the beginning and sometimes the ending of scenes, rendering them frustratingly nonsensical. There is some good stuff here, the gore is plentiful and satisfying, some of the action is good when you can tell what the fuck is going on, and there's a gleeful foul mouthed vulgarity and retrograde attitude to it all that is quite refreshing in this age of ""hey lets all get upset and offended by everything because im bored"", plus the central characters are really engaging, The loonies are a fun, riotous rag tag of ""mum joke"" spouting, mentally unhinged veterans, especially Travante Rhodes, Keegan Michael Key and Thomas Jane, Rhodes especially is a standout as possibly the coolest motherfucker in the movie and the most pure Shane Black hero of the movie. But Olivia Munn is the real takeaway here, she once again shows why she should get better roles and more of them. Admittedly if you havnt come into this thing with the expectation i have, then you may enjoy it as a bloody, funny, junk food, B-movie lark, which it can be whens its not being bewilderingly inept. The best i can give it is that if it was on tv late at night, id downed a couple of beers, a fair few beers in fact, and nothing else was on, id leave it on. It breaks my movie geek heart that this is my most positive thing to say about the film. A truly baffling, bitter misfire. I love you Shane, but woof, what happened here?"
590,5," IGNORE BAD REVIEWS!!!!<br/>This was a great movie! I am not a fan of the Predator series but I went and saw this movie anyway. I was surprised by how funny it actually was. I swear I laughed out loud about 15 times. Also super cool action. I don't need to say anything else. Just trust me, go watch it... it was good."
591,5," This movie was excellent. Critics trying to hard to diss movie. <br/><br/>***** It's OK if you wait for it on NETFLIX ******<br/><br/>... you will see how good the movie really<br/><br/>... and you will see that CRITICS ARE LIARS.<br/><br/><br/>The Predator 2018 still wins... <br/><br/>...and Critics will loose <br/><br/> Soon everyone will IGNORE CRITICS... NO ONE WILL TRUST THEM AGAIN<br/> <br/><br/><br/>Whoever thought it was good, keep spreading the word."
592,5, It was fun and exciting with a good story and follow up to the first two.
593,0, This movie is a compilation of everything that made the sequels terrible. Who asked for more (failed) comedy in their Predator movie? Who asked for more child actors? Who asked ever asked that the Predator be upgraded (problem with the third movie)? Who asked for (bad) CGI blood? Who asked to know what the Predators are thinking/saying? Who asked for a return to the small American town setting (that didn't work in AVP2)? Nobody did.. but we got it nonetheless.
594,5," Good news for Predator fans,<br/><br/>This was an awesome movie!!! Critics against the movie were extremely dishonest in their reviews. <br/><br/><br/>*The movie is NOT COMEDIC full of jokes DISNEY MICKEY MOUSE KIDDIE STYLE like the paid critics are saying.<br/><br/>*There were only few JOKES in the movie and all of them were HILARIOUS!<br/><br/>* Soldiers with psychological problems talk differently and sometimes it sounds funny, but its accurate. Not too much comedy just crazy talk from crazy soldiers.. <br/><br/>* Even normal soldiers that talk with each other say crazy things. Shane did a great job dialogue wise. <br/><br/>* There was ONE JOKE that was CRAZY MINDBLOWING (Trick or Treat part of the movie)<br/><br/>* Action packed suspensful all the way.... <br/><br/>* THE END IS FANTASTIC<br/><br/>* Lots of shocking awesome moments too ESPECIALLY THE END!<br/><br/>* And the quality of CG was excellent . -- Better than Mickey Mouse kiddy Avengers and Star Wars and Solo, Star Wars movie<br/><br/> I will be defending this movie forever."
595,0," Worst movie I have seen in a long time. Wanted to like it, was excited for it, and could not believe how bad it was. Whoever read the script and said lets make this needs to never make a movie again."
596,5, I loved this movie. Many people now a days will give bad ratings for the sake of it and not enjoy a movie for what it is in it's own right. This was old school 80s 90s cheesy action and one liners which I grew up watching. The predators looked amazing and the cast were awesome. I say ignore bad reviews and watch it. If you watch all movies with fresh eyes and enjoy them for what they are without over thinking it or comparing them then the negivitive trolls may actually find something to smile about without trying to over compensate for small ******
597,5," I don't usually write reviews, however this was a great movie. And the reviews are grossly exaggerated. Great acting, great storyline with a splash of humor."
598,5, Bwahahahaha was Shane black sniffing glue when he wrote this? Worse than the avp mockery. Serious who writes garbage like this or thinks this stuff up. Is this a parody? Comedy? I just streamed this I knew it would be bad seeing the trailer shame some of you actually shelled out cash fir this monstrosity. I mean the plot? Plot holes? Characters and actions? Dialogue? Painful to watch and embarrassing for any adult to even write this. Trainwreck from start to finish. You've been warned
599,5, It's actually quite funny which I wasn't expecting at all and it ties in great with the movie some great references to the old films nice constant pace of action likeable characters it's not by any means a copycat of the previous movies which is really nice. These critics really are whiny I would definitely recommend this film.
600,5," I ignored negative comments and went to see this movie and am glad I did. Why? Because like Alien, the Predator creature design and concept is now iconic, and absolutely brilliant and works awesomely on the big screen! From the first movie with Arnie back in 1987, I've always wanted to see the nasty, ugly, badass Predators again and again in their high tech suits and dreadlocks! I don't think there is a cooler baddie than these guys with their code of honour in the absolute and deadliest reality game they force humans to play. <br/>I think Shane Black has done well. Good old fashioned Saturday night sci fi at the movies entertainment - action, humour and Predators, the stars in this kind of movie, doing their thing. I enjoyed it, my wife did, too. Go see it!"
601,2, I've seen the entire series. I'm an avid movie goer from the mid 70siv seen and say through junk of all sorts. B-movie king. In all the thousand flicks I've seen I've waoked out I less than 5. <br/><br/>I walked out on this one. I was bored stiff. Silly story crazy characters. Lame plot line. Really disappointing????
602,1, WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST WATCH?
603,1," Horrible mistake for a Predator movie. At least Arnold and Glover made the originals interesting. This movie was made in a blender. Sure the ""New"" genetically altered Predator was bigger but he was also forgettable. Please don't make another follow-up movie (which you know they will)."
604,1," The pacing is all jacked up, the tone of the move is all over the place, and for some reason autistic children have the super power to read Preda-nese. I went in expecting nothing. I just wanted to watch the Predator kill people in fun and exciting ways. I left the theater trying to figure out wtf it was I just watched. On the positive side, I laughed a lot. On the negative side, I was laughing because of how moronic the movie was."
605,5, Critics are overwhelmingly judgemental this movie is a new kind of predator movie with plenty of action and comady it's not athought prevoking story but its wildy enjoyable and a blast to go see I hope everyone will keep an open mind :). <br/><br/>Rotten tomatoes is not a reliable sourse but niether is this review its up to you wether you like the movie or not I personaly did.
606,0," Wow was this movie horrible. I had memorize of the classic 80's version. Save your money. This is a sleeper, with zero sense of a plot. Worst movie I've seen in years."
607,5, Movies was funny and full of acation
608,0," So horribly bad. Th plot holes are huge, timeline makes no sense, pretends to be sensitive to autism yet fine making fun of Tourette's syndrome non stop which **spoiler** miraculously goes away once the soldier finds his courage. The cast is better than this piece of crap."
609,5," Ignore this rating, it's a brilliant movie. Unlike most action movies these days it has excellent writing; the quips and banter are amazing. The violence is over-the-top in an enjoyable way, the plot wasn't so ambitious as to detract from the movie (see a lot of latter-day action sequels like Independence Day Resurgence). A great spiritual successor to the first movie."
610,0," Maybe the worst of all the Predator series!! The writers, producer &amp; director completely misfire and torture the audience to this reckless follow up to a great franchise and story line. I apologized to my friend for how poorly written, directed and produced the movie was. Find the right produce, director and writers because this bunch gets an F!"
611,5, Its not your usual predator movie. This one has blood and jokes. Movie is actual monster slasher genre where hunter is being hunted.
612,1," So boring. The guns and SFX and overal production design was good, but everything was terrible. I walked out after an hour or so. Really bad."
613,2, What are you? Shut the fuck up.
614,5," Lots of great action sequences and, very funny, and had nice throwbacks to the films before it."
615,0, The charm of hunting gone. I was very disappointed.
616,1," I always liked the Predator movies. This movie.... does so wrong. 88 million dollars to make this tradh film? I had low expectations for this movie, but it went way lower than I could ever imagine. The editing and filming was horrible. Everything is relied on assumption. The comedy was stupid, bland, and heavily overused in every scene. Story didn't know where it wanted to go. Predators apparently want to have autism (I am not even joking. It was one of the plots). Things just happen with no logic or reasoning. The entire movie contradicts itself and leaves you wondering why on every decision made. Everything seems rushed as if there were major cuts from this movie in almost every scene. Movie makes you cringe and facepalm constantly. They literally make a joke about a mentally handicap kid and did noy even make a joke about ""Child Predator"". They went full retard in this movie"
617,1," ugh facepalm for watching this, this was terrible..."
618,4," It is entertaining. Good action, funny, good effects. Not disappointed to spend the money at the theater."
619,4, good film but final act got a bit coincidental
620,0," LMAOO the movie was very bad , the acting was weak af.<br/>Very cheesy please dont watch it"
621,5," Simply awesome! if you like the predator films, then you will love this film!"
622,1," This movie was lackluster and boring. I'm so sorry they got my money. <br/>The CGI looked like it was from the late 90s and the dialogue was as predictable as it was banal. The characters were boring, and the plot didn't make any sense even with copious amounts of disbelief fully suspended. Sometimes I can let plot inconsistencies go and just sort of shrug to myself. Sometimes I stop and pause if they are a little distracting, but these were just jarring. This was lazy filmmaking and an obvious attempt at a cash grab from the franchise <br/>I was really hoping for a lot more from this one."
623,1, Shane Black should be ashamed of himself...and the movie is terrible too
624,3, I think the movie was a lot of fun and much better than Predator 2.
625,5," As Nickleback would sing ""it's all in balls out"", from the song burn it to the ground.<br/>A proper full on kick names and take Ass :-) action film. Leave your brain in the foyer sit back and enjoy the ride cause it's gonna be a doosey. Loved it."
626,2," I like the Predator franchise, but this was dumb."
627,0," Shane Black, your film is bullshit!!!"
628,1, It's just plain bad.
629,4," Went in with low expectations but ended up with a smile, interesting spin-off and ideas to continue the franchise...some stuff I didn't like at all, but it still gave me a fun experience. Lots of action and gore!"
630,1," You know.......... this was a really dumb movie. The actors did their best, and the kid playing the little boy was great, but with all the killing, the dismemberments, and the ""good guys"" just living from one stupid situation to the next, it was lame. I'd wait until it's on video.........if that."
631,0, total time waste and worst movie of the series
632,5," An exciting movie with lots of high tech stuff, the bad ratings make no sense, if you liked any of the other Predator movies you will like this one."
633,4, anyone else sick of these autists on rotting dogshit giving bad reviews to good movies?
634,1, I didn't even watch the franchise but I can say that this is the worst one .
635,0," It's bad - AVP looks like a masterpiece compared to this. What a let down. It is all over the map with the story. The kid, the gifted kid, the bullied kid, the super smart kid the wife, MNB(white) unit, OM's useless character, the suicide squad, the Arnie dude, Predator vs Predator, Predator dog, the other dog, Halloween, space ships vs F15, predator vs military, scientist... ugggh free vehicles, Alien DNA (never answered), the laughable end. that's all I have to say.. SAD"
636,1," I went to see predator, not a crappy comedy movie. <br/>Plot was not well detailed. Things happen and you're like ""what? Why?""<br/>It fails as an action movie and fails as a comedy."
637,3," The Predator opens as an exciting thriller/comedy movie but starts to dwindle into a comedy parody of the original. While also establishing a very bleak ending with minimal explanation. But, storywise it was simply a father saving his son from danger with a ragtag group of ex soldiers looking to escape confinement behind military walls."
638,1," Sci Fi and tech 5, story plot 1. Not worth the money or time. I did like the alien dogs."
639,0, ????????????????????????????
640,4," The Predator got awful critic reviews but it was a pleasant surprise and I really liked it. Please don't take young kids they cuss and especially use the F word a lot, which is awesome for the dialog but not for kids."
641,3," Fun to watch, no depth of characters, generic plot"
642,5," It was fucking awesome, Laughed my ass off and enjoyed the hell out of the fight scenes."
643,0, What the hell did they just do to this franchise? Hot garbage. Super hot garbage. Don't waste your money. Shame cause the effects were amazing and the actors are all great... But the writers and directors did a trash job.
644,4," Entertaining with good laughs, nice action, and fast paced film. Predator franchise fans will enjoy."
645,1," 'The Predator' is yet another disappointing entry to a dead franchise, led by its questionable CG effects, flat one-liners and its utterly incoherent editing."
646,0," As good as the action scenes were the movie fell short in so many ways everywhere else. You can almost see the writers saying to each other ""F the previous movies, F the comics and novels, F the fans of the Predator universe especially."" Adding in unnecessary explanations for why the Preds collect skulls and spines. And throwing in one of the cheesiest action movie endings of all time, this movie had me almost throwing my popcorn at the screen in disgust."
647,2," Could have been way better. Typical Shane Black, not bad to watch but riddled with plot holes. So now he has the worst Iron Man movie and the worst Predator movie. What franchise will he MEH up next lol"
648,4, Everything I hoped for! So much action!!
649,1," A complete mockery to viewers who appreciate logic in storyline. Not worth a single penny, let alone a good 2 hours in the cinema."
650,5, Saw it last night and I thought it was super fun. The action moved along well and the acting was strong. Lots of action and pyrotechnics along with some well placed comedy relief and one-liners seemed to help it flow well. I was slightly confused by some of the transitions ... how did they get from here to there and where did this stuff come from. Just don't over think it and let the movie take you on a fun-filled action-packed ride and you'll enjoy. No spoilers here but looks like there could be more Predator movies coming in the future.
651,0," Eye roll sandwiche, millenial garbage. Junk"
652,4, Hilarious film which brought new and interesting lore such as giving a new spin as to why The Predators take the spines of their enemies. It also leaves a perfect set up for future films by using an adaptation of lore from the comics at the very end.
653,3," The first 1/2 to 2/3 of the movie was awesome, what was left though for the last part is what ultimately lets the movie down. It just becomes a non-stop and almost nonsensical roller coaster of silly and over the top events with little weight or payoff and the super predator that is built up to be such a massive threat is beaten far to quickly, easily and in a rather uninteresting way. The film starts our with so much promise but unfortunately ends in a big heap."
654,0, Went to see this last night. Not a bad film. Action scenes are good. Only issue I had was the new 11 foot predator was poorly CGIed
655,3, Solid rainy-day fare. The gore and (surprisingly) laughs are plentiful but a somewhat confused tone and at times terrible SFX put a damper on this fanboy party. However I must admit it's a lot of fun and not what I would consider an insult to a franchise that's seen better days.
656,5," Awesome entry into the Predator franchise, expands on the Predator mythology massively. As a big predator fan I enjoyed this movie from start to finish."
657,5," Brutally underrated. I might be biased as I am a fan of the Predator franchise, but it broke my heart to be one of the 13 people in that theater opening weekend. Please do not let the poor reviews lead you to believe the movie is bad. Go see it and you will enjoy it."
658,5," I don't generally like the Predator movies, because it's too violent for me. But this one had enough humor and loads of action (and I could close my eyes with guts &amp; blood) to watch it and actually totally love the movie. Besides, you can't go wrong with a cast like that. <br/>If you read critics who are nitpicking, don't listen to them. Remember why you like the Predator movies. It's sci-fi &amp; action. You'll get plenty of that."
659,5," Entertaining sci-fi, with plenty of action. If you like the other Predator movies, this will please you. This movie is exactly what it is supposed to be. Gotta love these beta-male hater critics who favor love stories, critiquing a genre they can't stand."
660,3," If we put all the franchise in perception, The Predator would be placed in a good position. This film really has good elements that made me entertained...it was much funnier that I thought it would be thanks to really good performances by almost all the crew involved, it got fantastic Vfx and cool action scenes, put at the same time it felt a bit offputing and brainless with no satisfying conclusion. <br/> In the end it is solid enough, great gags ans laughs but nothing storywise inovative.<br/><br/>CLASSIFICATION | 6.8/10"
661,2, This movie lost the whole point to the Predator movies. It had some good ideas but overall had a bad story line. I hope there are no more Predator movies. The franchise gets worse and worse.
662,0," Thoroughly disappointed! I love the Predator franchise, and it has so much promise for plots. This movie ignores everything that came before and just went for the gore from bigger monsters. Humor was forced at times. The ending was cliche and made me angry. So many many holes! All of a sudden, they have an RV. How did they get an RV? Makes you think that a lot of scenes were deleted leaving the audience asking how and why???"
663,4," I had to write a review in protest to the lousy critic score. This movie was a hoot. My wife and two of my teenage boys saw it last night and we all enjoyed it. It was easily the best Predator movie since the original. It was action-packed, funny, and had great throwback references to the original. And we really liked the surprise ending. Don't listen to the critics. I think they watch too many movies. If it isn't Oscar-worthy, they crap all over it. Some of us just like to be entertained for a few hours."
664,3," Funny how things come full circle. After starring in the 1987 original as jokester Hawkins, Shane Black returns to the franchise 31 years later. But this time he's not on screen, he's behind it both writing (with Fred Dekker) and directing. So it's no surprise then that this soft reboot is crammed full of snarky one-liners, crude jokes and black comedy - easily the funniest entry into the series. There are a few winks and nods to the previous instalments-""get to the chopper""-but it thankfully never veers into parody. A Predator movie, however, ultimately lives and dies by its action and violence, neither of which Black is particularly known for at this point in his relatively short directorial career. Yet he does a serviceable job in delivering the thrills and spills you would expect, offering up enjoyably pulpy set pieces with suitably gory deaths. There are a few missteps though, most notably the sequences involving CGI-heavy sidekick creatures and in general the over-reliance on night-time sets (although I'll admit that crappy 3D glasses may have made this seem worse). The eclectic cast is hit-and-miss, but largely adds spice; Boyd Holbrook's bland sniper Quinn McKenna surrounded by a ragtag bunch of misfits who clearly enjoy spitting out Black's razor-sharp dialogue, with Sterling K. Brown stealing the show as a charismatic arsehole whose savageness knows no bounds. An entertaining romp despite plenty of flaws and a lack of ambition, The Predator is a decent popcorn flick that'll please the masses but likely disappoint those fans expecting just a little more."
665,2," It has most of what you expect from a Predator movie, corny jokes, a close team, and lots of gory violence. I was pretty impressed early on when they didn't get super preachy. Unfortunately, as the movie wears on, it veers in to climate change, autism awareness, and of course superbadwomanwhodontneednoman. The ""surprise"" ending of the movie was met with audible groans from the crowd and lost me completely. It's sad because this is 90 percent a fun violent movie and the rest..... ughhh"
666,1, Utterly abyssmal. Couldn't haven't got the Predator any more wrong. A huge waste of time.
667,5," I'm not a typical science fiction kind of movie seeker, but who doesn't love Predator? I thought the movie was fast paced and kept me interested the whole time. There was lots of action and we got to see the predators the whole movie which was awesome. There were so many recognizable people too: the wife from the handmaid's tale, the boy from wonder, randall from this is us, the dad from riverdale, the guy who lost his penis in game of thrones, kee from kee and peele, and more! I wish there wasn't so much harsh language. (I don't mind, but it would make it more kid friendly) Overall, it made me laugh at some spots, and made me eager to see what was going to happen. I definitely recommend seeing it!"
668,0, Desde el primer plano es un autentico desastre. <br/>Terrible guión. Terriblemente dirigida. Actores sin carisma. Chistes sin gracia. Efectos digitales de pasada generación. Y diseño de producción nefasta. Para el seguidor de la franquicia (mas que nada la original de 1987) es otra gran decepción.
669,5," Amazing movie!! Great director and a wonderful set of actors that clicked lovely. Funny, scary and a great family movie. Unless you a lame parent that doesn't let kids enjoy Rated R movies."
670,1, What a travesty!!!!! Terrible dialogue. Awful jokes. The least frightening Predator ever. And the plot was just a mess of stupid scene after scene.
671,1," A stupid film with so many poor design choices. The Predator and special effects are good, but the incohesive plot, the story, the acting and the characters are terrible. There's no menace or suspense, replaced with a tirade of humourous quips from the soldiers which are mostly cringey and bad, and what plot there is has huge plot holes. If you can embrace the silliness, it becomes entertaining, but barely."
672,5," This movie was by far the best movie I've seen in a long time, the humor mixed with gory action was awesome ??????"
673,4, Very good &amp; interesting twist to the franchise
674,1, Don't see it unless you're a big Predator fan. End of story.
675,2," Messy and generic, The Predator has doses of entertainment but it's all weighed down by the overabundance of quips and attempts at humor by very thin characters."
676,1, This movie was an epic disappointment and really expected more from Shane Black but the messy plot and obvious reshoots just ruins what could have been a fun wacky entry.
677,3," It wasn't good and it wasn't bad.<br/>It was consistant with the lore.<br/>CGI wasn't the best.<br/>Complete popcorn flick that kept my attention even after a long work week. <br/>In other words, I didn't fall asleep.<br/>3.5 / 5"
678,4," If you are looking for a serious movie full of suspense and terror, dont go see this movie. If you want to see a monster tear people apart and have many laughs along the way, then you will have fun at this. Sit back and enjoy and you might be able to come out of this happy."
679,1," Worst out of the whole Franchise . The 1st half was somewhat interesting, but totally fell apart midway through. I wanted to enjoy this"
680,5," This movie was awesome! Any true Predator fan will tell you this. Saw it with a friend of mine and we were sceptical based on the reviews, but we came out very surprised how cool it was. Yes, it had some questionable scenes, but never did I cringe over a character doing something stupid. The action was there and at a good pace, the gore was something we all missed from the 80's &amp; 90's movies. The Predator lore was good and left us with questions. Go and see it!"
681,1," Terrible! Made what could have been a gear follow up on the original into a joke. Awefully put together, feels like it should be a release straight to DVD. If I could get my money back please!"
682,1," Where to begin the movie started off pretty great in the begging some hiccups but it was possible to be overlookedthen It went down hill as soon as The Predators no longe hunt for sport like HOW THEYRE SUPPOSED TO. They all of a sudden take DNA from their victims. Not only do they ignore lore but ignore the Predators true nature of being an honorable hunter. Seeing all of this I was flabbergasted on how the trailers built up for something big to happen to only be disappointed. When I saw the original Predator fight the ""DNA stealer Predator"" fight I was excited but boy was I slapped in the face when the OG Predator was killed in less than a minute. I couldn't believe what I saw. After all the hate the movie received early on I gave it a chance I was really looking forward for this movie. I've never been more disappointed in any franchise than this one I don't know who let this get this get past the script process but boy do they need to hire new people. Shane Black I'm even more disappointed in you."
683,5, Awesome movie! Going to see it again before the weekend's over!!
684,0," Worst movie of the year! Only good thing I can say about this movie is it had a very good pace to it. Other than that, I want my money and time back. Terrible! Stupid plot, terrible actors/actresses, action scenes and gore were substandard. DO NOT WATCH THIS."
685,5, Can't wait to see this!! Trailer looks awesome.
686,1," While the violence is solid, the ludicrous science expositions that carry the plot along and unfortunate flat humor had me confused. Is this the Predator film or a joke?"
687,4," Loved it, what it lacks in a muddy plot it more than makes up for it in action. If u want to be entertained, this is the movie for you."
688,3," This movie has never claimed to be anything other than a mindless action film. It's not smart, it's very predictable, and it is a lot of mindless action, but that is all it needs to be. Regardless of what the first film was like, this film delivers on exactly what it aimed to. Mindless, bloody fun. While much of the comic relief in this movie was nothing more than distracting, I still fully enjoyed watching this movie."
689,0," If you're a fan of the original Predator film I would strongly suggest avoiding this film at all costs, it is an abomination. It has so many plot holes it's untrue. Bad acting and writing is rife and the cgi is truly terrible."
690,2, Terrible..... I'm a huge fan of the Predator franchise but this was just about the worst installment out of all the movies. I
691,5," A unique tone, that I enjoyed, for a sci fi horror film. Doesn't take itself too seriously. For a franchise sequel, I found it highly entertaining and honoring of the Predator name. Don't understand all the hate. If you go in with appropriate expectations, you should have a good time."
692,5, Action pack roller coaster ride
693,1," Absolutely horrid filmmaking. It doesn't even come close to the original. Bad acting, weak characterization, and cheesy dialogue."
694,3," I watch The predator 1&amp;2, alien vs predator 1&amp;2, and Predators 2010. All the while the predator was mention this predator are Smart, Fast, bigger, skill upgrade just like that.<br/> In this new Predator 2018, shows this small predator completely are idiot.<br/>&gt; How can the heroin can chase the running small predator with very close? Is the Predator loosing his fast?<br/>&gt; How can the predator suit can be perfectly match for human size? Is it the predator looing his weight?<br/>&gt; How can the advance complete predator suit can wear by human at the end of the movie, but all the while this small predator didn't use this advance complete predator suit<br/>to fight those mega predator? Is it the small predator loosing his Smart?<br/>&gt;How can this small predator fall down on the top of bus even that predator already wear the Armor, when the hero shoot that predator with human made weapon?<br/>Please do not make the movie something like human are more smarter than alien technology."
695,0," Very disappointing, apart from Olivia Munn and the guy with the great teeth the acting was terrible as was the script. Couldnt wait for this farce to end."
696,4," It's a little predictable at times, but it's a fun ride. The Pace is quick. It has the same feel as the first movie. It doesn't take itself too seriously. It's pretty gruesome in parts so it's not good for small kids. It's pretty funny in Parts but not overwhelmingly so. Overall I enjoyed it. Can't wait to see the next one. Hopefully it will have less baggage behind the scenes. I think that Robbed from The Experience just because I knew all the drama that went on. If you can look past that, it's worth the money."
697,0," The alien 4 of the predator series. Garbage writing, backed up with badly acted slap stick action, mindless plot decisions, poor pacing, and just bad all around. I really wanted to like it, and hoped it wouldnt be the end of the predator series... but, total let down, B movie in every way."
698,1," Hollywood: ""Lets make another Independence Day Resurgence, but use the alines from Predator instead! and throw in some stuff about Global Warming!"""
699,3, Look going into this movie I could tell by the trailers that is wasn't gonna beat the first Predator to me thats a classic but it did indeed have a chance to be better then the other three movies plus the avp movies.The movie was alright but far from great . What I did enjoy was the violent nature of this movie you have to have violent and gore when you make a predator movie and they brought it in this movie I enjoyed the way the predator ran threw all the humans like they were nothing.The storyline wasn't bad could have been better the acting was decent maybe to many jokes for me .the film looked good . But what I didn't like was adding the kid into this movie. The kids storyline was just way over the top and way to much. As far as Predator movies go I think its not as good as the first or the third but its just a little better then the second movie. If you like the Predator and you like gore then the movie is okay just don't get your hopes up to high
700,5, Unexpected outcomes from the characters. Excellent CGI DYNAMICS. AND AMUSING IN A DARK HUMOR WAY
701,0," This movie is indeed ""The Predator."" It will kill 107 minutes of your life, one at a time. Watching the movie early on and seeing the parade of actors who you know you've seen play small time parts in other films like Jake Busey and Lochlyn Munro, you assume an air of legitimacy as you scratch your head about the casting choices. Then as we move into the second act, going from a tech savvy sci-fi flick with government intrigue, these familiar faces disappear and the movie does a complete 180 into a wonky buddy-B-movie. You almost wonder who was doing who a favor by being in this movie. Black's story-line is incredibly forced and nonsensical. His movie, despite the gratuitous nonchalant violence, comes across as a pastiche of hokey vignettes aimed at a prepubescent child with some explosions and swearing mixed in so adults will pay for it. The vague details of why the characters are where they are only draw more questions about how much thought was actually put into this script. The character development is just lazy. Each person has a schtick that is either beat to death or utterly forgotten. This guy smokes, even if its an inappropriate time, all the time, every time. This guy has Tourette's for one comedic scene, then... oh yeah, he has Tourette's. The one comedian in this movie tells jokes, surprised? And that one guy from Game of Thrones... you can't even remember his character's name, even after they remind you at the end. Production quality varies from scene to scene, making much of the ""action"" of screaming with guns blazing, just feeling trite. Seeing the CGI monsters in this film can only make one wonder what went wrong in the sixteen whole years since Peter Jackson wowed audiences with Gollum. And the ending is one for the ages. Culminating into a bizarre egg-hatching mystery moment and one of the worst one-liner finishes of all time, we're left with a half-promise that there might just be a sequel that despite all odds, could be worse than this monumental disappointment of a movie."
702,5, Good movie. Great ideas :)
703,4," This movie is not a masterpiece but man I had a blast watching it. Fun charactors, great action, and Shane Blacks comedy. I loved it!"
704,5," Fantastic fun. A modern rarity where energy has been invested in a great script and humour, over distracting CGI short cuts. The audience was energised and laughing etc"
705,5," This may not be as great as the other 6 films but i still loved it, the predator series is alive again! Screw all the critics, the predator is the best movie in the 20th century fox universe!"
706,0, This was complete crap. The comedy was good when there was some. The whole plot was something that a low budget syfy show would do. The big predator was completely c.g.i. and looked like it was taken from the 90s. There nothing horror about this. There was nothing at stake so you didn't get wrapped up into the story. You didn't care about any of the characters. The very end was like watching one of those Pacific rim movies. Shane Black get the hell out of movie making. Never write or direct again. You kill everything you touch now.
707,5, This movie was awesome!! The cast was perfect for this film. I really wished they would have kept the original script but overall it was good
708,5," So this is for everybody bashing this movie. This shit was awesome. If you want a good time and a fun end of summer movie this is it. From beginning to end it's just blood, guts and every fuckin bit of crazy shit!!! These guys are awesome ?? So please go see it for yourselves and make up your own mind. Just stop piggy backing off of everybody else's opinion. Happy Hunting!!!"
709,0, It feels too much like the 1st and 2nd movies with Predators wrapped up into one movie that doesn't look very good
710,1, I wish Shane Black would actually bother to learn to write dialog. And I wish this was the only problem with this script. What a mess this movie is. And could somebody please explain to me how the first Predator was some kind of hero?
711,4," Loved it, reminded me of the 80's movies I loved."
712,4," Great to see a franchise that doesn't take itself too seriously. Lots of laughs, lots of violence, lots of fun"
713,4, It was one of the better remix even though there were a lot of funny scenes the Gore and the hunting was pretty good
714,0, TERRIBLE MOVIE EVEN FOR FREE!!
715,5," Action packed, never slow and just the right kind of humor without being hammy. Olivia Munn rocked her role in this film. This movie does exactly what it intends to do, Entertain! I very much enjoyed this film. It's different enough from all the other films out there to merit an honest chance. I only hope this movie goes in the direction it hints at with a possible introduction with Munn being a Mikiko type character in future iterations of the franchise. Again, Munn showcases her ability to be an action star. Go see it for yourself and see if I'm right."
716,5," Soooo good!!! <br/><br/> I'm really getting tired of critics bullcrap lies.<br/><br/>- This is Shane Black's best work... but critics trying to hard to diss movie.<br/><br/>- Audience clapped and cheered in my theater. <br/><br/>But critics really want people to only watch Disney kiddie movies. <br/><br/>- Solo a Star Wars story 2018 - 71%<br/>- Star Wars Last Jedi 2017 - 91%<br/>- Ant-Man and the Wasp 2018 - 89%<br/>- Avengers Infinity War 2018 - 89 %<br/><br/>Critics doesn't want people to watch other good movies like:<br/><br/>*The Predator 2018 - 34% score<br/>*Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom 2018 - 48% score<br/>* Equalizer 2 2018 - 50% score<br/>* Predator 2, 1990 - 25%<br/><br/>Good news for Predator fans,<br/><br/>*The movie is NOT COMEDIC full of jokes DISNEY MICKEY MOUSE KIDDIE STYLE like the paid critics are saying.<br/><br/>*There were only few JOKES in the movie and all of them were HILARIOUS!<br/><br/>* One joke was CRAZY MINDBLOWING (the Trick or Treat part of the movie)<br/><br/>* Action packed suspensful all the way.... <br/><br/>* THE END IS FANTASTIC<br/><br/>* Lots of shocking awesome moments too ESPECIALLY THE END!<br/><br/><br/>Give this one a shot if you can. If you can't.... then wait until it comes on NETFLIX.<br/><br/>And then you will see HOW GOOD THE PREDATOR 2018 really is...<br/><br/>and you will see THAT CRITICS ARE PAID and FULL OF SH....TTT!<br/><br/><br/>EVEN the critic Wannabees on YOUTUBE! Yes they are ALL PAID...<br/><br/>- Chris Stuckmann<br/>- Beyond The Trailer <br/>- Grace Randolph<br/>- Jeremy Jahns<br/><br/>They are all paid to talk crap about the movie. They lied big time.<br/><br/>Soon EVERYONE WILL IGNORE CRITICS... NO ONE WILL TRUST THEM AGAIN"
717,3," I really like the action and joke, I also like how they are making a new franchise out of the old classic movie, and I want to see the sequel of this new Predator movie."
718,0, It's a disjointed mess of a film with a bland lead actor and shitty action sequences. A waste of time and money. Also please stop letting Shane Black direct films. He's horrible.
719,0," Appalling movie, every scene fell short. Shocking to see such a poor production from such a fantastic director."
720,2," It's like a terrible 80s horror/science-fiction B-movie created for the modern age! After hearing numerous comments belittling this fourth installment in the Predator legacy, my personal opinion on the film is simply this: they're not wrong -- it's bad, and what predominantly makes it so is its defective human foundation. The characters are awful, and the dialogue is even worse, but the kills are bloody awesome, and the violence is a ton of fun. The predators steal the show, as they should, but the film's excitement is often deadened by its dull and shoddy human protagonists. Although this is the worst entry in its franchise, an interesting point to mention is that Predator 4 is, nonetheless, better than Alien 4 (i.e. The Predator upstages Alien: Resurrection). Despite its flaws, this movie is still watchable, and the potential for this iconic monster is still simmering, but if the future serves up more sequels like this one, that potential could die off quickly."
721,1," Definitely not living up to the hype. The story was all over the place. I cannot agree enough with critics as far as the questionable choices with this movie. Does it want to be an action or comedy? All I know is that this movie is pretty laughable. And so disappointing at the quality of several CGI scenes, definitely seen much better. Poor job."
722,3," ""In my own opinion, this is by far the most fun 'Predator' film I've ever seen. I like the direction with the cinematography, the story made sense to me, and the casting is very well done. The Predator himself with the design was freaking awesome, the action sequences were bloody and entertaining, and I like the fact that this film is different than the others. It's unexpectedly a fun IMAX Experience. I'd say this is better than 'Predators' from 2010. For flaws, I would say that there are some off scenes that didn't make any sense, there isn't any suspense, people make some freaking dumb choices, and some parts in the film felt choppy at times that I feel like this film was ruined by studio interference. It's not amazing as the original film however it's a very entertaining film that any fan of 'Predator' should enjoy this year."""
723,5," So this is for everybody bashing this movie. This shit was awesome. If you want a good time and a fun end of summer movie this is it. From beginning to end it's just blood, guts and every fuckin bit of crazy shit!!! These guys are awesome ?? So please go see it for yourselves and make up your own mind. Just stop piggy backing off of everybody else's opinion. Happy Hunting!!!"
724,5, Love it! Very fun and intense!
725,3," ohmygosh; why are people such harsh critics?? it's a freaking alien creature with buildings -- &amp; people -- getting torn in half! i was entertained... i also thought it was quite funny. when i saw Keegan was in it, i was a little worried; but he was actually a great addition. the turrets guy had me rolling."
726,0," Didn't feel like anything from the aliens or predator franchise, felt more like the new jumanji movie. Was very dissapointed and the scene at the end is stupid..."
727,0, Horrible movie!<br/>Bad actors!
728,5, A must see for the fans of the Predator movies
729,4," They did an excellent job treating the fans with this movie. It certainly shouldn't get a rotten review! It's action all the way and has some interesting ambitious additions to be made to the whole Predator storyline. I am a fan of the original, Predator 2 and Predators and I would put this movie on a par with Predators. <br/>Don't know why it is getting panned by reviewers."
730,2, It was in a gray area between good and bad
731,0, La pelicula mas mala que he visto últimamente. No vale la pena gastar un centavo en este film.
732,4, Don't know what all the fuss is about. Great movie to continue the story.
733,5, Great movie! Could see it 1000 times and would still good
734,1," Didn't have high hopes for this even though I love seeing the Predator in action(despite the last few movies featuring him being mediocre). Then the trailer came out and it looked even worse than the AVP entries. I should have gone with my gut on this and waited until Netflix. This was a shit show through and through, from the horrible writing to the crappy CGI(Predator dogs, are you fucking kidding me?!) and lousy characters. This felt like it was written by some 12 year old fan who happened to see the original once and preferred AVP2 instead. Damn, this shit was wack yo. Only reasons this doesn't get a half or a one star is because the ""ultra predator"" was a cool idea and Olivia Munn is smoking hot. That is all."
735,5, Really enjoyed this movie
736,3," No, this isn't a documentary on Jarod from Subway.<br/><br/>THE PREDATOR<br/><br/>The first 2 Predator films were awesome, that's never gonna change. The AVP films pretty much flopped with most folks, except me, &amp; maybe a few others. The Predator film with Adrian Brody...was ok, but even I thought it might be trying a bit too hard. Can this new film recapture the awesomeness of the past? Let's see...<br/><br/>At around 2 hours, the story hits the ground running, &amp; then takes it's time. The pace is kinda slow, but not in a boring way. I did notice a few abrupt edits here &amp; there that made it feel a bit choppy at times, &amp; I'd love to see how long the original cut was. But for the most part, it flowed fairly well.<br/><br/>The cast did great. Our two leads, the hero with baggage, &amp; the not damsel science lady, are both entertaining separately &amp; together. I kinda wanted them to get a romantic subplot, but it's cool they didn't fall into that trope. Our ragtag squad of antiheroes reminded me of the soldiers from the first film, &amp; every action cartoon 5-man band ever! They were never unentertaining, Guardians of the Galaxy without the spaceships, everyone played off each other in a really heartwarming way. There's also a kid in the mix...HEAR ME OUT...at first I thought he was gonna be a load, but he turned out to be the most relatable of all &amp; highly entertaining. The villain was both refreshingly intelligent, &amp; gleefully evil, like an over educated rich kid, expecting everyone to cow to him because, thinking our heroes were dirt for him to step on...&amp; MAN WAS HE WRONG. All he needed was a twirlin' mustache. The Predators were in top form, the Mark-1 is a classic, &amp; surprisingly relatable Predator, the Mark-2 reminds us why these beings are actually scary! Both of them look great, move great, sound great, &amp;...just ARE great, period!<br/><br/>The effects bring the A-game of both practical effects, &amp; CGI into full glory! We get to see the grit &amp; gore of the old school films, with CGI that helps expand &amp; complement the world on display, rather than overshadow it. It feels very well balanced.<br/><br/>The music is Predator gold! With the classic theme song back &amp; better than ever, &amp; a few new songs that act as solid backup for the main theme.<br/><br/>The Predator is a clear love letter to fans of the original 2 films. It references them, but not in an in-your-face way. We get to see that it's not just humans vs predators, ya don't know who to trust! We haven't had a solid action-comedy-scifi-monster movie in a long time, &amp; if this is the beginning of a new branch of the Predator franchise (cough-cough, sequel beg, cough-cough!!), then I can't wait to see what's next! 3 &amp; 3/4 stars outta 5!!"
737,5, I absolutely loved this film there was a few things here and there but definitely one of my favorites
738,3, Go for the Predator stay for the Munn.
739,4," it was not a bad movie people need to like chill a little a society has come to the point where there is no way to please everyone... The movie is a good popcorn Flick I enjoyed it loved hearing the theme music again the plot just ok but what else can you do with the Predator?? any way I will agree in 1 thing only the ending (Arnold was supposed to do a cameo but turned it down because it was just that a short cameo at end ) so ending of movie was changed and yes the ending was the only part that killed it for me the whole scene looked like it was thrown together in 30 min even cg was rough compared to the rest of movie now with that being said once again I did like the movie humor was just enough good action and good suspense (true Predators fans will support this movie if not will never see another Predator movie again) we can disagree on what was good or bad about this movie but if it does not succeed in the box office then we do not get a chance to maybe later get a better one while some studios dont listen to fans other do,,,,"
740,0, absolutely shit. don't watch
741,1," Finally, I am happy to find a movie that is dumber than Soul Plane!<br/>What disrespect and parody of the Predatory Methodology!"
742,2," Its a hodge-podge of uninteresting characters that the film tries to force into a ""Dirty Dozen"" mold and fails miserably through poor development lacquered over with misplaced attempts at humor. More often than not, I found myself desperately rooting for the Predator to tear the cast limb from limb. The action sequences are serviceable but the most this movie has going for it is the Predator name...but its just not enough. This is ""The Last Jedi"" of Predator movies. Wait for the DVD."
743,5," The most entertaining of the franchise. This film injects crack into every scene, and it's amazing for doing so. Reinvents what a Predator film can be."
744,4," Thoroughly enjoyable film. Does what it sets out to do, which is to entertain the viewer. Never takes itself seriously. Literally dumb fun and it embraces it sooooo well. Think people are misjudging this film-they expect it to be a copy of the original when it couldn't be further from the source material if it tried. I found myself laughing to a lot of the jokes, some of the jokes don't land but that's fine. Action is good with plenty of nasty gore which is something expected of in this franchise. When you go watch this film don't set your expectations too high, don't read into it too much and just literally switch your brain off for the runtime. If you do that I can guarantee you won't be disappointed!"
745,4," I can see why people don't like this film as it is a departure from the original. I found that this change in tone was refreshing as it didn't retread familiar ground. This film moves very close to a comedy rather than making it ""gritty"" and doing what predators failed to achieve. This film is a great action popcorn flick that does a great job of entertaining if your willing to set aside nostalgia."
746,5," I thought it was a lot of fun - we laughed through the entire movie (at the appropriate parts, of course)."
747,5, It was a great and funny movie. Thought it would be scary but it is more of a comedic than horror movie. Still a ten out of ten for me.
748,1," extremely disappointing,SHANE BLACK OR BETTER SAID SHAME BLACK,GO HOME!!"
749,3," Who better to direct a sequel to one of the greatest action movies of all time than one of the actor-turned-directors who was along for the ride in the first place? Shane Black's ""The Predator"" may not contain any of the simplicity or subtlety of that masterful first installment, but it does contain a decent amount of the fun, ultimately shaping out to be one of the best ""Predator"" sequels I've seen yet. Well cast and featuring a bevy of jaw-dropping action scenes, the movie is almost ceaselessly entertaining, save for a few moments where the narrative tread a bit too far into left field for my tastes. Overall, though, it was a noted effort and an unquestionably good time, to say the least."
750,2," The destructive arrival of a new Predator ship on Earth sends its sole living witness, Army Sniper Quinn McKenna (Boyd Holbrook), into a military psychological institution. After sending the only salvageable evidence to his home, McKenna, together with a pack of traumatized war veterans and an expert evolutionary biologist (Olivia Munn), tracks down the Predator (Brian A. Prince) in the suburbs of Georgia before it or the government can hunt down his family. <br/>Forget the jumbled series' continuity, ignore the films that have come before it, stifle your expectations, and you can have a pretty fun time with Shane Black's ""The Predator"". Much like how he took the ""Iron Man"" trilogy's finale in a uniquely smaller direction, Black's newest film is a close-knit action-thriller light on the bombastic, but huge on character.<br/>Together with his ""Monster Squad"" co-writer, Fred Dekker, Black's touch is felt all over ""The Predator"". As snide quips fly back and forth its colorful cast, the film trucks by each scene at a breakneck pace that always keeps the energy flowing. In the vein of ""Iron Man 3,"" the addition of a young boy with Asperger's (the spectacular Jacob Tremblay) leading a good amount of the film also feels like something only Black would do. <br/>It doesn't hurt that this different take on the franchise is backed up by a fantastic group of characters played to a tee by some pretty good actors. Keegan-Michael Key, Trevante Rhodes, Thomas Jane, Alfie Allen, and Augusto Aguilera make up the loveable heart of the film as a group of psychologically institutionalized veteran soldiers suffering from a variety of mental illnesses and disorders. The actors play their characters' tragic histories with respect while cranking out some wonderfully endearing performances that really elevate the heroes beyond standard background stocks.<br/>On the other end of the tracks, Sterling K. Brown nabs the spotlight as the obligatory government/military bad guy. In a different kind of role for him, Brown is sarcastic and a bit of a bully. It's great seeing Brown break loose to really ham up an otherwise standard villain character-it wouldn't have been a bad idea to incorporate more of him throughout the film. <br/>And while Olivia Munn's feminine presence (a trait usually lost in the uber machismo of the ""Predator"" franchise) is enjoyably felt as the charming, headstrong scientist of the group, the same can't be said of Boyd Holbrook as the film's lead. It's not his fault, as he gives a more than solid performance as a father going beyond the call of duty to protect his family. He's just not given the material to develop a memorable character. <br/>It's its plot where ""The Predator"" stumbles some. The narrative is fine, and there's some solid mysterious undercurrents that keep one's engagement well enough. Some tonal story blips and an odd narrative shift around the halfway mark feel off, though, and once the reveals start dropping, they underwhelm. It becomes clear that the second half is just a setup for sequels which may or may not pay off, making the film lose a good chunk of its impact and leaving the big, action-packed third act to outstay its welcome unfortunately quickly. Similarly, the questionable use of terrible-looking CGI blood and body doubles also sullies the otherwise great digital and practical effects going into creating the film's unequivocally cool aliens. <br/>Shane Black's unique character and stylistic offerings make the sixth entry in the ""Predator"" franchise at least somewhat fresh. A weak plot aside, there are enough good action and character moments to give one a good time.<br/>Grade: B-"
751,2," The Predator is undeniably thrilling and embraces its R rating with hardcore violence, unfortunately they're not enough to make up for the film's lack of engaging human characters, humor on par with a Michael Bay film, and the bizarre choices made within its clumsy narrative!"
752,0," This was a special brand of terrible. If you like Predator movies, or action movies, or good movies, or tolerable movies you should avoid this."
753,2," The opening scene of this movie immerses the audience into a galaxy far far away. And no ... Luke Skywalker will not be your hero defending the universe from Darth Vader and the Death Star. The Predator is on the prowl again entering the Milky Way Galaxy through one of space's natural and mysterious phenemenas, a black hole to pay a visit to earth. When the father sends a package home with gear obtained from the Predator's crash, his son gets his hands on it which unleashes alien havoc on the city. Does the father have what it takes to defend his family, crew, and city from the invasion? Wait ... I forgot about Olivia Munn's character. She's kind of a big deal. It's nice to see a female role step up and kick some alien a** in this film. This film consists of crude jokes, humor, and disturbing images. If you're looking to phone home to a friendly alien, E.T. (Extra-Terrestrial) is a family-friendly movie everyone can enjoy. Please don't take young children to see this movie."
754,5," Pretty bad. Seemed like a bunch of random scenes thrown together, obvious attempts at humor,stock characters."
755,3," I couldn't say I was bored watching this but I also probably won't remember much about it either. Decent action but a plot that was ok at best, with lots of corny one liners thrown in.<br/>*AMC A-List Movie #13"

757,2," Wow. Saw this yesterday. I'm very disappointed that Shane and company mailed this one in. The trailers actually made it look kind of good in parts, but before long I realized those trailers had been incredibly misleading. This film isn't anything like those previews. It's as if they tried to make it look like something it wasn't in the trailers (very dishonest, but common). Something that could still be considered a Predator film and exist in that same universe while introducing some new ideas. That couldn't be further from the truth. What this is, is a really weird and inconsistent effort that truly did seem promising at times but never felt like it could be a part of the Predator series. This movie is really, really bad overall. There's no getting around that. <br/>There was almost zero tension. How can there be tension when everyone's always talking. There was no atmosphere. They were sloppily jumping from one thing to the next, and I definitely had the sense that this had been endlessly butchered and reshot. It was never even remotely scary. I have considered Predator 2, which isn't the greatest film by any stretch, to be a pretty decent sequel nevertheless. I saw it as a child and it scared me to death (particularly the subway scene). I still enjoy it for what it is. I'd like something better, but I can live with it. Predators gets about the same reaction from me. Pretty decent overall, although not as good as the first. However, both Predator 2 and Predators are without a doubt head and shoulders above The Predator. This film totally deserves the 23% rating it's getting from the top critics. <br/>What was really missing from The Predator? Pretty much everything. I mean, seriously, at times I had to check to see if I had a controller in my hands because I thought I might be playing a video game. I want a scary movie, and also a movie that truly does inspire that Close Encounters feeling you talked about Shane. I didn't get that at all, what I got instead was a mailed-in effort that's trying to be a Marvel offshoot but is also failing at that.<br/>I'm still kind of shocked the day after. A slap in the face to those who have been waiting so long for a good predator sequel. Don't get me wrong, I thought Predators was pretty decent. But this... This truly depressed me."
758,5, exactly what i wanted in a predator film i hope to see more of these films. since the ALiens movies were done horribly and this film was a vast improvement on a lot of predaotr films
759,3," It wasn't soo bad. I enjoyed it. It was a decent popcorn flick that didn't need too much expectation on my part. I really didn't care for the human actors, just wanted to see what they did with the alien Predators and evolution from the regular look to the hulking new enhanced version. And it did not disappoint in that department. Great SFX, lots of sliced flying body parts to go around and the introduction of the Predator dogs was a treat."
760,0, Worst movie ever!!! Worst actors and actress ever
761,2," The action was great, but characters were flat as a rock.. the humor was not funny, some jokes were funny but they should of made the movie a little bit more serious.. overall the movie was a disappoinment."
762,1, Thought the movie was enjoyable but would not recommend it to anyone for a two reasons. First Olivia Munn telling the dad of an Autistic child to have his son dial back his sycosis is offensive. Next having two other characters latter refer to the child as retarded. Hey Shane Black it is 2018 get with the times.
763,1," Terrible reboot, the original with Arnold is far superior"
764,3," Out of all the sequels, this is my favorite. Some cool characters... still can't beat the original tho."
765,3, Not too bad. I liked the action and cast. They were not bad actors and the cgi was great. The film did not take itself to seriously but that doesn't mean it wasn't good it was funny and entertaining . :)
766,2," poor overall, but might be entertaining if you aren't expecting much."
767,4," The movie was fun. Professional critics are weird in their tastes, once again. Not as good as first, on par with Predator 2 and Predators. Fun stuff, but not an intelligent film: Neither is the series as a whole, so that's not really something to look for in this movie. Go see it and side step the critics."
768,2," Directed and written by Shane Black, I didn't have high hopes for the film, from those trailers and then this awful scandal behind the scenes, but I was genuinely surprised by what I saw! I know the critics have been tearing this film apart, but I had a blast with it. There's a lot of fun to be had with this sci-fi action blockbuster, and there is plenty of action. There's a TON of blood and gore, which you would expect from a brutal Predator, hunting and killing for sport. There's also an excellent touch of comedy from, of course, Keegan-Michael Key, and surprisingly Thomas Jane. I am usually not a fan of the way comedy is implemented in these types of films but I felt it really worked here. Yes, there is plenty of cheesy 70s-80s dialogue in this script, and it doesn't always work with this cast, but sometimes it does, which will put a smile on your face. <br/><br/>This cast of over-the-top cheesy action heroes (Boyd Holbrook, Trevante Rhodes, Olivia Munn, Sterling K. Brown, Alfie Allen, and the previously mentioned comedic duo) truly worked for me. Such great chemistry between this cast, felt so natural and that's saying something, considering the whacky sci-fi action story being told here. If you choose to see this film despite the behind-the-scenes controversy, hopefully you have a blast with it as well. I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did, and the film's score is outstanding as well!"
769,1, What a TURKEY! This thing is such a convoluted mess even Olivia Munn can't save it. Save your money. There's a scene where two men shoot each other put each other out of their misery. It might be more fitting if it had been the director and the producer.
770,0, wow. it feels like a syfy movie. this one is almost as bad as avp-r.
771,2," I don't regret watching it, but I probably won't watch it again any time soon."
772,0," DO NOT DRIVE YOUR CAR, DO NOT WALK, DO NOT EVEN MOVE TOWARD YOUR THEATER, THE PREDATOR IS A BIG MISTAKE. DO NOT MAKE ONE YOURSELF. READ ON AS THE BAD REVIEWS ARE SPOT ON AND FUNNY."
773,2," The Predator peaks at roughly 30 minutes in and sharply declines afterward. <br/><br/>There is next to zero character development, and the action seems forced as if they tried to put 10 pounds of action in a 5 pound box. <br/><br/>While the homage to the original's score is a nice touch, it is quickly abandoned for something that sounds like a Thor movie for the last 2/3 of the movie. <br/><br/>Contrary to other installments every Predator in the movie is quickly dispatched, leaving the viewer with that feeling of ""that's it?!"".<br/><br/> Coupled with the CGI and non human-in-a-suit ""Ultimate Predator"", terrible Predator language subtitles and ""translator"" used in the end, this installment gets two stars: one for having at least having a Predator in it and one for even attempting.<br/><br/>Save your money and go watch 2010's Predators again, it's an under rated film that holds true to what a Predator film should be about: the hunt."
774,0, The seats are filling up for this one and it's not even friday.
775,3," By no means a perfect movie, but an enjoyable action flick non the less."
776,0, What a let down it was like The A team meets The Predator.<br/>So disappointed with the film slap stick comedy made it cringe worthy .<br/>No scary moments at all!!!! I myself was not a big fan of Predator 2 but now this film makes me appreciate it more.<br/>Did not like the silly child in it and the plot omg!!!<br/> I've seen better fan made films which have the Predator in it.
777,4," I've read some of the reviews of people that SAY they've seen the film and I question whether they actually did. The film starts full throttle with a military operation! Sound familiar??? Viewers of this film will enjoy the subtle callbacks to the original and enjoy that original music of the original film. The film itself is.....VERY GOOD! Tons of action. Very enjoyable dark comedy by Keegan Michael Key and Tom Jane. Boyd Holbrook shines in this picture, much like Logan. Olivia Munn?? Eh, did not buy her as a scientist and is forgettable. I would have loved to seen Much More of Jake Busey's character instead. I wish we could've switched them out for one another. The Ending? I wont ruin it, but its very original from Shane Black. I thought originally it was gonna go one way, but it went another. Really sets up for a sequel that I hope we get. Tons of fun movie!"
778,1, The Predator is a terrible embarrassing mess.
779,5, Action packed movie and great direction for franchise
780,0," This is hot garbage, complete mockery of the predator series (not that it was good after the first one). The plot is extremely dumb, not thought out and makes no sense. Acting is pure $%6T, they should never let Oliva Munn be in another movie. I don't know who thought this moving was a good idea. This is one movie I should have listened to the critics."
781,1," I just saw the movie (at Brazil they always open at thursdays instead of friday at US). And the most accurate review I can give is: next this new entry at Predator's franchise, Alien Vs Predator 1 and 2 are masterpieces. Seriously.<br/><br/>Despite being directed by one of the actors from the original movie you should not be fooled by the thought that he would understand what the original made it a classic and apply his knowledge to at least make this movie entertaining. And you should already have a hint about this movie quality: Arnold Schwarzenegger was offered a role and declined saying he would be part of it only if the entire script was rewritten. That is a big red flags from the beginning.<br/><br/>There are many problems here. First is how hard the script tries to make the team that will confront the predator likeable to match the chemistry among the actors of the first movie, and it doesn't work anytime. No character is interesting or relatable. And despite people being murdered everywhere jokes are fired over an over , almost being one every five minutes. That undermines any tension or fear, as if they are fighting a bear thar unfortunately can use guns. It is like the group from the movie ""Grown Ups"" being confronted by predators.<br/><br/>The predator itself is pointless: you could exchange him for any generic monster and the movie would be the same: his intelligence, tactics, gear are almost non existent: camouflage barely used, heat vision simply ignored at most times, gear that isn't used accordingly ( firearms from humans aren't fight back with the plasma cannons for example), etc. It is so laughable that the humans can operate every single weapon and devices from predators with no effort: the plasma cannon at your shoulder makes you specialist and fully able to use it at will, no training required.<br/><br/>The plot is a mess and is a revised version from the first Alien Vs Predators: they want something that ended at humans hands and need to be taken back. But the government can't let that happen, so what can it do? Well, kill anyone that has any contact with the aliens to hide everything. The problem is that it tries to kill its own collaborators (ex: call someone to help with knowledge and then kill the person because it saw the predator) or change 180° degrees, offering peace to people that it was trying to kill since the beginning of the movie... And you clearly saw the trailer with the predator dogs... Can you imagine it playing fetch with humans? Well, that happens... Yeah...<br/><br/>The girls at the movie are a joke: put clearly just to appease the trend of strong females but making no sense at all. And let's empower kids with disabilities too: mental impairment here makes you specialist at cryptography, computation, alien languages and technology among many other feats.<br/><br/>At almost the end, when most people is dead, a character says that they won't be remembered despite the sacrifices they made. And it is actually a blessing: be forgotten is something I would wish after working at this movie."
782,2," Reminded me of an 80s straight to VHS action movie. Bad acting, cheap SFX (the dogs reminded me of Ghostbusters), awful plot and bizarre editing in parts, but it was mildly entertaining and very violent for a 15. The teenagers might enjoy it, but fans of the original will just laugh."
783,0," Equally as dumb as a Transformers flick with bad acting, bad editing, bad direction, and a bad script. Save your money from this bucket of poop."
784,4, Good popcorn flic...im a big predator fan so I saw it before Friday release. Go into this movie not expecting much and just turn your brain off or you will not like this movie. Great character development and I enjoyed the plot with the cliffhanger that leaves this movie open for a sequel. If you want to go have a fun time then go see this movie!
785,0," I did not think it possible, but this is--by far--the worst Predator movie yet. How could anyone have read this script and believe it would be a success? It betrays everything that made the original great and the entire dialogue reads and sounds like a pre-teen wrote it. Shane Black wrote this story for children! For the love of God, please stop making Predator sequals."
786,0," awful movie, i have never left a review before but had to for this. plot line failures galore just ruin it. munn was at least decent in her few scenes and I laughed at a couple of one liners but just sad overall."
787,2," Some good action sequences and lots of funny moments (Too many for me) Lots of references to plot points that never happened or aspects characters couldn't have known. Leaving you questioning if you'd missed bits or just assuming scenes had been cut, which leaves the film feeling very clunky. Pacing was too fast which made character development difficult and character arcs all but impossible. Has none of the charm of the original although has plenty of tips of the hat to Predator and Predator 2. Enjoyable enough"
788,2," Enough humor and enough fun to overcome some poorly edited scenes. If you are a fan of the past films, this one does enough to watch."
789,0, This movie was an insult to the franchise.
790,4, First I want to say I enjoyed the originals. This was better than I expected. There was some cheese .... but the movie was good. It was was funny and better than the critics are saying. Worth the time.
791,0," Went with high expectation 2018 Predator would b full of new surprises. However it's full of S**T, a prefect example of worst direction, acting, production, story, worst graphics/special effects and more. It was as if I was watching a D grade movie. A complete torture. <br/>Do ur self a favor forget about a Predator Movie ever releases in 2018.<br/>Did they even watch their movie before releasing it."
792,1," Total crap... in every aspect, from story to direction to editing to VFX to acting!"
793,4, Really enjoyed the humor and action. made me feel like one of the older movies
794,5," Loved it. It was different than past Predators, which I enjoyed. A bit less tense. Maybe a bit too unbelievable at times, sure. But, I loved the humor that the loonies brought to it. The main group of characters played so well together and had us cracking up. The bad guys were appropriately dislikable. The aliens were great. There was one special effect early on that didn't seem up to par. But, beyond that ... it was great. It has action, cool geek sci-fi, dudes with skills, and an amazing lady that is way too smart to be as physically awesome as she was ... but I loved her screen time! And, the humor was great and played well. Just loved it."
795,0," THE ENTIRE MOVIE MADE NO SENSE, DESPITE SOME ENTERTAINING FUNNY MOMENTS WHICH MADE THE AUDIENCE LAUGH, THE MOVIE ITSELF HAD A STUPID STORY NOT WELL DEVELOPED. NOT AUDIENCE GRASPING AND QUITE FRANKLY ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES OF 2018!"
796,0," This looks more like parody of the former Predator movies made by the The Asylum film studio. Cartonish characters, awefull CGI, lame omnipresent, out of place jokes. This movie is everything what predator movie shouldnt be.And the ending which i dont even know how to comment, the dumbest idea ever. I had exactly same feeling when i watched Terminator: Genesis. Why this movie was even made? What for? To disappoint or piss off fans of the original?"
797,0," It's the worst Predator movie of all time, plain and simple. Do not waste your time going to it. It's so bad that it is not even worth downloading for free"
798,3," The action is fun and entertaining. But, the overall story is a bit weak."
799,1," Why, oh God why? This seems like a movie rushed out because they needed to produce something to keep the rights. My lasting memory was Olivia Munn's character got called upon because a) she was a biologist and b) the govt. cross referenced a letter she sent to the Whitehouse when she was 6. What? Are all letters to the president written in crayons indexed and used 25 years in the future to qualify someone as an expert.<br/><br/>Bottom line, watch and enjoy the trailer. Skip the movie."
800,4," Finally a proper sequel to the original! Not a perfect film, but a fantastic action packed thrill ride with the right touch of testosterone fueled humor."
801,2," Unfortunately it was a massive let down. I can only hope that any future installments of the franchise will completely ignore the changes made to the Predators motivations and backstory in this movie. They completely took away one of the only things that made the Predator species stand-out among all the other generic sci-fi movie aliens. They didn't need to be given cliche and generic motivations for why they come to earth, they already had a motivation, hunting the baddest motherfuckers on the planet to prove themselves and collect trophies. They were nomadic and tribal despite being a space travel capable species. This movie tried to change all that."
802,5," Great popcorn film, action, comedy it is great escapism. If you are looking for a thoughtful film rewatch ""A beautiful mind"" This is turn your brain off fun, if you can sit back and roll with absurdity you will have a good time.... if you see a plot hole and it bugs you to the point of distraction then this movie isn't for you... So sit back and watch the predator kill people and people try and kill the predator, if that is enough you will be like the other people in the theater with me and say ""that was awesome"""
803,1," 'The Predator' that we get on the screen is no way the film Shane Black intended - surely? Fox has obviously forced him to 'Deadpool' it up.<br/><br/>To sum it up, the film is a parody of a 'Predator' movie, it's a spoof of the franchise and the current mindset of studio executives with their ""MCU, MCU, MCU"" envy.<br/><br/>Why is it a parody? <br/>One running joke is that they shouldn't be called 'Predators' and it's repeated so many times it gets annoying. The first time, I liked it, it's a reference to the first film's original title of 'Hunter' and a dig at marketing execs who want a catchy name, but repeating it verges on insulting the actual series as a whole.<br/>Then there are the callbacks to lines from the first film that are played for laughs - cringe laughs. <br/>The score chimes in everytime a helicopter lands just because that's how the original movie opened. <br/>There's a tacked-on ending that's a direct swipe at the studio with a 'Fant4stic' reference and dig at studios who want every film to kickstart their own MCU.<br/><br/>This is a joke, it's not a proper 'Predator' film. They took all the studio notes and delivered a lampoon of the franchise - giving the studio exactly what they asked for in the most sarcastic way possible.<br/><br/>If you go in knowing it's not a serious film and basically an MCU/'Predator' hybrid, then you may enjoy it, but I really wanted a 'Predator' film that took itself a bit seriously with Shane Black humour fitting in naturally - not being forced in. Yeah, the original had p***y jokes, but this leans very hard into that, very hard and when the serious moments do occur they aren't in the right place or I wasn't in the right mind space to appreciate them because the spacing of the funny and serious moments is way off."
804,3," It was fun. The script is miscellaneous but polite at key points.<br/>The soldiers' character was also cute and I liked it. However, only the last cliff hanger is not cool."
805,4, Fun B-Movie with an amazing cast
806,2," This could have been great, but it was a dud. More SJW bullsh@t thrown into yet another formerly-alpha male franchise to push ""inclusiveness"" and such. Some action sequences were fun, as were some of the one-liners, but overall this was a massive disappointment."
807,3, couldn't disagree more with the critics. Watch this movie and find out for yourself.
808,1," Movie makes very little sense. The amount if cliches is overwhelming at times. The action suffer greatly regarding the inconsistency of the predators skill and power. For the unnamed characters the predator can literally RIP them in half, but the main characters are merely tossed around and allowed to recover and try again. Not to mention the amount of bullets fired that do little to know damage. Silly movie, but not in a good way"
809,0," This the worst movie of the year. I can see why they pushed the trailers, because that's the beast the film has to offer. Complete trash. I know many people will go and see for them self but it's a real piece of sh##."
810,5, I like this movie loads gore and action . <br/>Story could been better .but like all the Characters And jokes <br/>Clad he did the reshoots in this and I hope too to see the second one to this <br/>Don't take the film too Seriously It's movie guys and it's one of the better ones <br/>And I know u guys might like my review but I thought it was cool <br/>And see a lot more then any other predator movie ?? <br/>Sorry no spoilers here
811,4," Cool back story added to the film, acting was solid, comic relief throughout movie was a nice touch"
812,5," Very Entertaining! I refuse to read critics review and make my own judgement, because i am an adult"
813,4," Forget the critics , sit back enjoy the action, effects and be taken back to the 80s. As a long time predator and alien fan this was exactly what I was looking for , loved it , laughed myself silly<br/><br/>John g"
814,2," As a predator film, its a flop. Making a mockery of the original with sub par humour at best. They've turned a horror movie into a comedy and a mediocre one at that. With that being said if it was a film without the predator title and was a generic film about aliens coming to earth it would have been a lot better and enjoyable as the style of movie didnt feel like a predator movie."
815,2," Movies exist so that you can show, not tell. There are more speeches to more this story forward that the f word and the f word is used like oxygen. Instead of showing us why things are happening, characters make massive leaps of logic to tell us things they can't possibly know. Tics are used to create characters, rather that character development. Sterling K. Brown's character chews gum as a defining trait. Why? Who know? It's a real disappointment coming from him. The plot jumps all over and uses set pieces to distract you from the fact the plot doesn't make sense. This movie joins the heap of bad sequels to the original Predator. It's just sad."
816,3," The movie wasn't bad...I went to see an action movie not an indy drama, critics ratings way off. It was fun, good pace, good plot for an action movie, likeable characters, Olivia Munn was awesome."
817,0," If you are a fan of this franchise (Especially the comics), DO NOT watch this movie. It's a huge let down. It's not even remotely like the survival style movies the previous ones were and they tried to hard to add some ridiculous the Earth is doomed and there's a new evolution of humanity theme to it. If you do want to watch it, wait for it on Netflix or something. It's not even worth the dollar theaters."
818,5," very goodddddddddddddddd Predator"""
819,1," I've never left a review in my life and after seeing this last night I felt I had to&gt;<br/><br/>As a long time fan of the original, I held out huge hope for this -, especially with Shane Black's involvement.<br/><br/>Then I read some sketchy reviews and lowered my expectations slightly. You could not lower them low enough for this discombulated disconnected corny sh#t show of a film. Cocaine is a hell of a drug and thats the only thing I can think of that got this film to the state it was onscree - they must have been out of their minds"
820,0, SPOILER WARNING.. i hate it mate. was a total joke. So an autistic child is a alpha male hunter with some iron man knock off crap from a predator that is a rogue human lover. its a joke. i was so infuriated with this movie i threw my popcorn.
821,5, The movie is fun and has plenty of action and gore. It's a enjoyable movie all the way through if you enjoy action and gore. The lore is easy to follow and understand from preadtors planet. Dont take it to seriously its a fun action flick with a alien hunter. But the gore effects are amazing and some of the comedy is really good and some is a little forced. But its not overdone. Im 23 and enjoyed this movie.
822,1," This is unbelievable garbage and an insult to any Predator fan. I hoped and expected the resurrection of the franchise and got a movie in the range of Alien versus Predator 2. It is 100 % action movie, completely lacking the ""Predator"" atmosphere. There are too many characters in the movie, undeveloped and unsuccessfuly incorporated, without any charisma, especially the main ones (Boyd Holbrook and Olivia Munn). Music is some kind of copy of Alan Silvestri original that tried but couldnt lift the atmosphere because the scenes were changing to fast. The Predator is visually ok, some scenes with the ultimate Predator came with the CGI from 10 years ago. Humor is ok, but its exaggerated. Yes, I know, it is probably damn hard if not impossible to make a fresh, interesting and in some way an original movie of the successfull franchises like Predator, Alien or a Terminator but this...this is an amateur work. Destroyed my day and night , coke and the popcorns. R.I.P. Predator franchise.<br/><br/>Stay home and rather watch any other Predator movie.<br/>Shane Black, shame you, You should be visited by real Predator."
823,0, A very stupid movie that is more of a comedy than anything else. Awful.
824,5, it's a very good action movie go and watch it you know you love it
825,1," Dreadful. <br/><br/>It is a mess. A true mess. I don't even know where to start.... It actually starts off pretty good but then the ""comedy"" elements start to kick in and they are genuinely so painfully unfunny and often downright bizarre I just sat there with a bemused look on my face! It was so awkwardly unfunny that at some points, I was expecting Adam Sandler to walk in... I just couldn't believe I was watching a Predator movie. <br/><br/>It is all CGI, crash, bang wallop and the plot is just beyond ridiculous, even for a Predator film. I am a huge fan of the franchise but this is just a horrendous and crude cash in. It throws every cliché in the mix and just doesn't know what it wants to be. Serious action film? Comedy? Sci Fi? Action? CGI showpiece? I had pretty low expectations after seeing Hollywood butcher other amazing franchises such as but nothing could prepare me for this.... The Predator dog, the ridiculous Power ranger suit at the end, the double suicide scene, the spaceship surfing, the ""jokes""... I don't know what was worse!? <br/><br/>Apart from Olivia Munn and Sterling K Brown who are both actually really good... the performances are a shambles. <br/><br/>As bad as the AvP films were... I don't remember being THIS horrified by them. <br/><br/>Predators awas a far better reboot and I just wish they continued with that rather than subject the world to this garbage. Worth a watch for fans but I don't think any real fan will see this as being worthy of carrying the ""Predator"" name in its title."
826,4," The Predator is a Shane Black film through and through. If you aren't familiar with his work, then you might find this disappointing. The tone is certainly different to any other Predator film with jet black humour from start to finish. This comedic element can take away from the gore and violence, which in a series that's bloody, this rates as one of the violent entries. I personally have loved Black's work since Lethal Weapon, so I was sold on this from the start. My only complaint is that I would have preferred the film to be shot partly during the day as the dark becomes tiresome at times. Its a solid entry and if its successful, set it up from more mayhem."
827,0," Picture, contrary to all expectations and trailers, specifically not itself has gone. Even in the first minutes in the movie, I was beginning to fall asleep. <br/>The idea to shoot a picture in dark tones is quite bold, because this step involves bringing any horror, fear to the audience, but it was not. <br/>There was a lot of blood, meat, torn parts of the body, the creators were not afraid to make a picture of foul language and toilet humor, which sometimes had a feeling - ""What am I doing here?"".<br/>Star cast? No. But the actors, oddly enough, were picked up very well. And played their characters, though sometimes idiotic, very well.<br/>Shane black behind Iron man 3. Which was pretty good, which is why I had an expectation that the Predator would still shoot, but it was even worse than in 2010.<br/>And it is worth noting Cosmoprof with dreadlocks, and that dog with human friends. if this is all humor, my status is bewilderment and shock... It seems Predator, exactly like a Alien, has outlived itself, hence my score on a five-point scale:<br/>Selection of actors and their game-5<br/>Plot-2<br/>Humor - 2 <br/>Graphics-5"
828,3," I'm a theater manager so I was able to see this early. And while I wasn't expecting much I thought the comic relief was enjoyable. That's why my three star review. But like all of the Predator sequels, and most of the Alien sequels as well, The Predator suffers from a script and director intent on making more of the material than is there. Both franchises were best when confining the plot to characters who are cut off from humanity or help. It's as if both franchises have caught a virus from the whole overblown superhero movies. Where every director wants to make the ""Be All, End All"" superhero movie of all time. So you're left with the dilemma, where do we go from here?"
829,2," ehh... not the worst film ever, but still really bad"
830,4," Just plain fun, makes me wish I'd been given an 80s tough guy name."
831,1," First act was great, it really felt like the old films.. then Olivia Munn hit the screen and it began to tank, exponentially getting worse as the film went on. The biggest surprise came at the end when the movie somehow hit a low that I did not think was possible. <br/><br/>Olivia was not the reason the movie wasn't good. She was just introduced around the time it seemed like the director must have had a stroke because the movie did a complete 180. <br/><br/>Something must have happened during production. Watching this movie was like those tests where they make artists take acid or coke and then see the progression as it goes through their system."
832,3, It could be so good...but it isn't. Cheesy though funny script and light plot fail to support the return of one of my favourite aliens. It was an enjoyable romp but left not wanting more.
833,4," Shane Black likes telling stories with style. I haven't had this much fun at the movies in a long time. THE PREDATOR was a blast, and these critics who liked THE LAST JEDI can eat my shorts!"
834,4, I really like the movie its action packed the acting was good most of the males and the kid not Olivia Munn she can not act for nothing always like Predator movies
835,4," Awesome cast that gave each character depth. There were plenty of moments that made the audience laugh &amp; gasp. The predators look amazing &amp; have a lot more depth. This was a bold film into the franchise that I enjoy. I was relieved the predators were for the most part NOT crummy CGI like alien covenant. I was not a fan of the ""dogs"" but that's just me. You need to see this film in a good theatre to enjoy it. Don't believe the ""professional"" critics that are giving this film a ton of hate. There is a clear storyline here &amp; it is fast paced so I assume they didn't pay attention. The film opens up the possibility for more movies"
836,3," Great action, decent story, a bit too much on the humor, but not off putting like the last Jedi. Would definitely recommend watching it."
837,0, Was looking forward to watching this all week... And now I wish I didn't watch that abomination of a film.
838,1," 1/5. The Predator has a handful of funny and cool moments, but the script feels like it was written by a 12 year old, the effects are bad, the characters are annoying, and the film is insulting to the ones that came before it. One of the most disappointing movies of the year."
839,4," Nonstop over the top action and comedy! It isn't perfect, but it' is Great!"
840,2, I am sad to say that it's definietly not what we were hoping for...
841,5," great cast, characters you care about. funny,exciting, one for the fans, thanks,"
842,1," Sad to say, the worst Predator movie by far. How did Shane Black of all people get it so wrong? Movie is dumb, poorly paced, lazy, and completely the wrong tone for a Predator movie. If you're one of the people who hated Predator 2 for its more corny, dopey moments you'll really hate this one. The ensemble cast was laughing, cracking bad jokes, and acting like buffoons through most of the film, instead of acting like people who should be taking the dangers seriously, much less trained soldiers. The audience was laughing AT, not with the movie most of the time, and I even had complete strangers come up to me afterward because of my Predator shirt and say ""man, that was really bad!"" The only good things I can honestly say about it is that it goes for its R rating in terms of the violence and gore, and there were a few cool ideas with the Predator tech. On the bright side I'll save money by not wanting to own this when it comes out on DVD. You should save money by not buying a ticket in the first place. Lastly, the movie ends with a promise of a sequel that will surely never come after this one bombs."
843,3," 2 and a half stars first half was good and then it fell apart, oh it could have been so much better."
844,5," Critics are out of their minds and it makes me wonder why half of them get paid to ""review"" movies. If you're a fan of the Predator franchise, you'll love this movie. It's not going to win any awards, but it was fun as hell to watch! Let's hope these overly critical with zero passion for the material don't ruin this movies chance at getting a sequel. At the time of my posting 87% of google users enjoyed this movie that has a 23% on RT... something's amiss."
845,1," This movie should have gone direct to DVD. The acting were ""C"" with exception of Keegan Kay and Thomas Jane. Olivia Munn &amp; Sterling Brown were a mess as a part of the plot and both deserve solid ""F"" for their acting (one wonders if those two should even be called actor and actress). The plot was choppy, the story was written by a 1st grader and the whole movie is a lost cause. I would have expected a little bit more drama or substance but this one stinks from opening to the very end. Hopefully they put this one into bed and don't make another stupid sequel after this one. This one won't even breakeven in box office."
846,4, I went to see the movie yesterday and it was great I don't know what the so called experts are talking about they are full of shiiiit
847,0, This movie just sucked. Train wreck from start to finish. I own both Predator and AVP films and I can honestly say I will NOT be adding this to my collection.
848,2, The Predators movie from a few years back was better. I expected a lot more from Shane Black considering his past directing and definitely his writing. There are definitely a few lines that stick out and are what you'd expect from him...but overall it's kind of a mess. Sloppy editing and some plot holes really screw up what could have been a fun movie overall with funny disposable characters. I'd say if you can catch a matinee and don't have your hopes too high it's not a bad way to spend some time at the theater but I really hoped for a more cohesive film.
849,2, B grade storyline and too much comedy. Joust another Predator movie that wasn't taken seriously. I always get my hopes up with the predator movies and leave disappointed.
850,4," Very much enjoyed the movie. It is not perfect however the action sequences are well done, the humor is on point. It is quite exciting. The ending has a twist. My one issue is we did not get more character development of the loony crew. Boyd Holbrook does a great job and has more charisma than Adrien Brody from Predators. I also wish I knew why a specific agency wanted to go after some of the protagonists. The upgrade predator looked pretty good from a CGI perspective not at all rubbery like the Xenomorph from Covenant. Good movie worth the ticket and I will probably be seeing this again. One last note the attacks really had some gore to them adding gravity to the Preds attacks."
851,3, The first 3/4 of the film where amazing until it got into the reshoot area but it's a good movie not great but good
852,0, THIS MOVIE WAS SO SORRY! I'D RATHER WATCH AIR BUD!
853,2, Great action and special effects but not enough to save the bad acting and very loose plot holes.
854,4, It's just as good as predators a little better in my opinion. Not quite as good as the first definitely worth a watch or 2.
855,0, I had to leave this theater because it was so insulting to my intelligence to argue with a person that was protesting abortion so I can have an intelligent conversation
856,1," The Pedator frachise is dead! I wanted to hope Shane Black had enough insperation to make a great Predator film. I was wrong. The orginal Pedator film had realistic action/violance, 80's action cast of stars, SUSPENCE and Horror. This movie has unrealistic cgi character predators, cgi goore, and the actors are more comedic than anything else. The movie and its plot is stupid and schizophric. I could go on.and on, but im so deppressed I can't. At the end of the night, I can sum this movie as a Fox cooperate cash grab, get a fan favorite 80's property, add a medicore cast and substandard plot butchered by commities and add crappy effects, now you have a modern scfi /action movie. I like Shane Black, but if I were him I would be so embarressed by this abomination!"
857,2, To be honest it was definitely not worth the wait. It was a fun action movie that could've passed as a pg13 movie. Knowing the history of the past movies really ruins the movie.
858,4," Interesting in the way it linked to the first two films. The violence was a little over the top as well as the use of the f-bombs, but the story was cool and it was a new direction for the franchise to go. Very entertaining especially if you are a fan of the first two films."
859,5," It was a nice movie, not the greatest but good."
860,4, Tons of fun. Would recommend.
861,5," READ IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN PREDATOR.<br/><br/>SO I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS MOVIE, THE TITLE IS SUPER MISLEADING. <br/><br/>IT IS ""NOT"" ABOUT A PEDOFILE LOOKING FOR KIDS TO PREY ON, I WAS FLACCID THE ENTIRE MOIVE, NO MALE NUDITY EITHER.<br/><br/>THIS ""PREDATOR"" MOVIE IS ABOUT SOME ALIEN CREATURE KILLING PEOPLE ON EARTH. I DIDN'T REALIZE THIS UNTIL THE END OF THE MOVIE, AND WHEN I SAW THE MOVIE POSTER ON MY WAY OUT OF THE THEATER.<br/><br/>OTHER THEN THAT, GREAT MOVIE FOR KIDS, REMINDED ME OF FINDING NEMO 2."
862,0, Absolutely the worst Predator movie ever made. What a disappointment
863,4," Bloody, violent, and so funny. Characters I actually liked. Not perfect but I loved it."
864,3," Not a great movie, but not a bad movie. Olivia Munn was there to be the one female member of the team. Plot was all over the place. Good movie as an action comedy. One liners, some a call back to the 1st two movies.. ending was Meh.."
865,5," gore galore ! very fast paced , action from start to finish ! funny through out , very self aware. loved this movie !"
866,5, Great movie all the criticism is unfair this is by far one of the best predator films yet saw it with my step dad great movie l
867,1, Left me with so many questions
868,3, Good action and good one liners. It's hits all the right notes for a Predator (hunter?) film
869,5," This is an awesome film with great characters you care about, gory action, great music, the cgi isnt the greatest from today but thats a minor flaw in a great film"
870,3, Good action film. A few continuity errors. Plenty of decent action and laughs. People need to get over how precious they are about old action films it's not like the original was an Oscar contender. Also film reviewers need to have different scoring scales for different genres this against high brow stuff is just pointless.
871,5, Best one in a long time
872,5, Freaking awesome movie. But it totally ruined the predator series
873,2," Way too much plot and far too many characters for a Predator movie makes for a series of long, drawn waits for anything interesting to happen. Nix the backstories, nix the family angle and nix all the crap about climate change and genetics and you might have a watchable movie."
874,3," The Predator franchise isn't something that's remembered fondly by filmgoers, but rather the original on its own. For that reason alone, I didn't have many expectations when going into this latest installment, other than the fact that Shane Black wrote and directed it. He has been a favourite filmmaker of mine for quite some time. He has always been known for adding a friendship storyline to his films, so I was curious to see what he would do with an ensemble. While I can't quite say I had a blast with this movie, it's a fine addition to the franchise and fans of Shane Black's style will probably get a kick out of multiple moments. Personally, this movie didn't really work for me when looking at it as a Predator film, but it was an average outing for Shane Black as a whole.<br/><br/>After Quinn (Boyd Holbrook) goes toe to toe with a creature, he is able to escape with elements of this ""newly discovered"" race. Being discovered by a little boy in Rory (Jacob Tremblay), he accidentally calls their race to Earth. From there, as you would expect, chaos ensues and death definitely occurs. In terms of the action involving the Predator, I never found that anything new was brought to the table. Sure, there are a few very clever moments in which blood is utilized, but the Predator itself was as generic as ever. That being said, there are a few aspects of the movie that worked against that notion.<br/><br/>Never in my life would I think I'd look at a franchise that's known for testosterone-fueled men and say that the best part of a sequel is a little kid. Jacob Tremblay has always proven himself to be a fantastic young actor, and not only does he give his all here, but he, along with Boyd Holbrook, are the true standouts in terms of characterization and performances in general. If you find yourself cringing at times, just know that a great scene with Rory or Quinn is on the horizon. Sadly, aside from Olivia Munn, this cast isn't given enough to do here. There are quite a few times where it felt as though they were present for the sole purpose of providing comedic relief, which leads me to my biggest complaint about this movie as a whole.<br/><br/>The Predator is a hilarious movie. Yes, I found myself laughing pretty hard on multiple occasions, but that was the film's largest downside in retrospect. The Predator franchise has been known for the cheesy action and light-hearted dialogue, but this movie was a straight up comedy at times, while the action seemed like it was trying to come off as genuine and trying to provide the audience with stakes. This contrast didn't quite work for me and I found myself scratching my head on multiple occasions. The action was fun and the comedy was great in certain moments, but those two specific elements felt like they belonged in a different film.<br/><br/>In the end, Shane Black has directed a fun blockbuster, if it wasn't called The Predator. If this movie had swapped out the Predators and replaced them with a different alien race, I think people would've been able to look at this film like a solid alien action/comedy from Shane Black's creative mind. Instead, this movie is a showcase of his talents, while being a very muddled and lukewarm addition to this franchise. As I mentioned, there wasn't anything new brought to the table here for this universe. From the score to the overall execution of the action, everything felt very familiar. I had fun watching this movie for what it was, but the meshing of the aforementioned elements just didn't quite work for me. I left this film disappointed, but still having had a decent experience."
875,0," A giant sack of dog nobs, and a large turd dropped from a great height onto the franchise. Just don't."
876,5," Fast paced, violent, and filled with references to the first two Predators, it is all around a very good movie. The only reason critics are putting it down is because the movie is politically incorrect. All in all, its another great addition to the franchise."
877,0, I'LL GIVE THE PREDATOR TWO THUMBS UP WAY UP AND I'LL GIVE THE PREDATOR THEIR FULL BUDGET PLUS 10 PERCENT THE PREDATOR WILL HAVE TO KEEP GOING UP AND THE PREDATOR WILL NEVER GIVE UP
878,0, Great action. Fun humour. 7/10 from me.
879,4, Solid action movie with a large cast a bit of ropey editing in one or 2 places but the gore is a plenty and the Predators get plenty screen time. Sadly critics will hate this and pick it to shreds. Proper fsns however will be fairly satisfied. The your mamma jokes are vulgar but brilliant.
880,0," The Predator is all that it has to be: a fun, gory, action-packed sci-fi film. Definitely my second favorite of the franchise."
881,0," awful, awful reboot of the franchise"
882,0," With a very simple story , good humour , action packed as well as being very fast paced , this movie does credit to the original , forgetting a bit in the process however."
883,0," I think these critics are paid trolls. In my opinion, as a HUGE fan of the original Predator and Predator 2 films, this film is a bases loaded home run knocked out of the park. It had everything I wanted to see: gore, a good script, good post production special effects, a good score...I think this was the best Predator film since the original."
884,0, Loved this film so good hope they do more Predator Films now.
885,0," If the critics hate it, We will love it and it will be a great movie. The only movies critics like anymore are lgbt movies or Political movies that lean their way. Sad."
886,5," I have seen some of the more negative reviews by a lot of serious 'naysayers'! Despite there were a number of racist overtones and syllogisms, its fitting to say that this is an activism movie of sorts. This movie typically highlights what real-life America is all about and not the touchy urbanites in NY, Boston, San Fran and Miami. Racist and bullying overtones have been a problem in heartland America and anywhere else in the world, because that's where real people live! So its NOT surprising when children as young as 7 or 8 make fun of less fortunate and kids with certain disabilities. Of course when the bullies called out a kid with Asperger's Syndrome as ""Ass-burger"", I felt disturbed but the kid managed to fight off the bullies, with his savant's abilities. Rory, you the MAN! But wait, not all villains are bad in this movie. Apparently, one of the Predators is supposed to show up in earth to expose what his comrades and oversize brothers were doing to themselves. That too as well, the US Gov that's supposed to protect people ended up being the corrupt ones trying to stifle information from the mainstream society. 'Hybridization' is a serious problem not only for aliens but for humans as well. As foucault once say, power corrupts in any societies and this being aliens, not only want to corrupt their own kinds but to conquer the universe. As for humans, 'hybridization' will lead humankind to being super-beings as well either via weaponology or suiting up to be like ""Predators"". Last but not least, we must not forget Olivia Munn for being brave to highlight a real sex predator on the movie set and had his credits and images withdrawn."
887,0, Dunno why it won't let me rate it. 3/5.
888,0," Tons of absolute rubish. Disappointed,"
889,0," Bored with Hollywood's lack of imagination. Remakes and sequels, nothing new. It'll flop."
890,0," Its was both fun, funny and gory. Key and jane steal the show but the very end seems a bit chessy to me but overall i thought it was fun to watch and i hope it gets a sequal."
891,0," Predator is a story that, at its fundamental basics, cannot be duplicated - unless you want to entirely change the design of the Predator (which we know they won't do because they're relying on that particular cultural icon to sell the film.<br/><br/>What worked in Predator was not knowing what the Predator looked like. Once it's revealed, which it was in 1987, then you lose the original principle upon which the drama was based. This film can only serve as nostalgia and frankly I'm sick to the back teeth of nostalgia in ineffective films."
892,0," Why using CGI so much ? There's a reason why the two first predator movies gave people goosebumps. The aliens looked real and organic. 10 ft predator wasn't even necessary, all we needed was a great story and some great actions."
893,0, It was a great movie of predator series.
894,0, My opinion the trailer like b movie
895,0," It's a Predator movie. Yes it may have it's flaws but it will be entertaining to watch. Remember Predator 2? That was terrible the first time watching it, but in time it became a classic."
896,2," I really haven't seen such backside foolishness in a really long while.<br/><br/>Film just did not make sense. To say that Continuity was lacking would be quite generous.<br/><br/>Such a wasted opportunity, it should actually be criminal."
897,0," well, another movie that fails the new rt sjw score. get woke, go broke"
898,0, We had a lot of funn with this film.
899,0, The Worst Predator in the franchise ... I am really upset Because I am sure we will NOT see another predator for a really really long time .
900,0," Shane Black brings an Amazing,fun,and Gorry and it makes it a fun experience"
901,0, Just watch the new predator. Starts of like new pair of white trainers. Then you walking into a large mountain of sh!t
902,0, I really can wait to see this movie this is gonna be awesome
903,0," The dialogue at the end of the movie was ""that's gonna be my suit""......do you think you're ironman or what?"
904,0, Looking forward to the debauchery of terror and mayhem.
905,0, The fim is ok doesn't really compare to 1980s film
906,0, I thought it was a great movie with all put action and kept me interested all the way through
907,0, I'm totally seeing that movie Friday. This will be so Bad@$$.
908,0, Its a new fresh start to predator franchise added a new story characters that seem interesting enough to see this movie plus there's more hidden content to it so it could an alright movie 4 out of 5
909,5, to be honest i really liked the film its a classic
910,0," Saw a sneak preview last night. This movie makes the AvP series look Oscar worthy. So bad, it's hard to believe Shane Black had anything to do with it. Burning your money would be less of a waste than seeing this film. Name a bad , over played sci-fi plot device, and there's no doubt it appears in this film. You want friendly, lobotomized Predator dogs? You got em'! You want a super-sized Predator (another terrible ideal from Predators (2010)) with a retractable exo-skeleton? You got that too!!! How about the fact that Predators are now bullet proof? Check! Remember how Predators used to take trophies of skulls/spines? Well, they actually are actually harvesting DNA (before Climate Change makes humans extinct - not kidding) - in this case the DNA of a disabled kid because he's ""the next level of evolution."" This is only the tip of the iceberg in this disjointed, awful, abomination of movie. I got to see it for free and want my money back. Everyone involved with the creating of this film should be embarrassed...and then exiled to Planet Predator. Dear Hollywood - please stop destroying great 80's movies."
